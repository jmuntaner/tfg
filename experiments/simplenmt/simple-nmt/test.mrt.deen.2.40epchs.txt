you know , one of the great reasons when travel@@ ing , and one of the pleas@@ ures at eth@@ no@@ graph@@ ical research is to live with the people who can remember the old days , that their past still feels in the wind , tou@@ ching them on the rain@@ fall , touch them in the bit@@ ter leaves of the plants .
just the know that ja@@ gu@@ ar sh@@ am@@ an@@ es travel beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the meaning of the my@@ ths of the ol@@ dest of the on@@ est of in@@ u@@ it is still full of important , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as the budd@@ hi@@ sts still follow the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , that is the idea that the world in which we live , are not in absolute sense , but only as a model of reality , as a con@@ sequence of a group of certain possibilities of adap@@ tation that our oni@@ ons , rather than quickly cho@@ sen many generations ago , cho@@ sen just a lot of generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ t@@ ability .
we all born . we bring children to the world .
we run through the initi@@ ation ritu@@ als .
we need to diver@@ ge with the un@@ stopp@@ able separ@@ ation , and so we shouldn &apos;t be surprised that we all sing , dance and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique pit@@ ch of the song , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the pen@@ an in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ st@@ in in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ or in the ka@@ is@@ u@@ ge desert from nor@@ ken@@ ia , the cur@@ ander@@ os in the front of the sahar@@ a . this is the collea@@ gue i &apos;m travel@@ ing with a month ago , or even a y@@ i she@@ pher@@ d in the middle of the sahar@@ a desert , or even a y@@ i she@@ pher@@ d on the hang of the q@@
all these people are taught us that there are other people who are facing opportunity , other ways of thinking , other ways to ori@@ ent on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , you can only gl@@ ue you with hope .
together , the local cultures of the world are forming a network of spi@@ ritual and cultural life that thro@@ ws the earth , and for the exi@@ sting of the earth , like the biological life that you know of as a bio@@ sphere .
you can think of this cultural life network as an eth@@ no@@ sphere : eth@@ o@@ sphere can tran@@ sc@@ end the vast sum of thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths of ideas , optimi@@ ra@@ tions and intui@@ tions that have been gener@@ ated by the human imagination since the early beginn@@ ings of conscious consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity .
it is the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re capable of as stun@@ ly privi@@ le@@ nant species .
and just as the bio@@ sphere was strong , this was done with the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- only with even bigger speed .
no bi@@ mes would say car , for example , that 50 percent of all species or more of all species are before the extin@@ ction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ um in the field of bio@@ diversity -- is almost true what &apos;s known as the optimi@@ stic scene in the cultural diversity of cultural diversity .
and the cru@@ cial indi@@ c@@ ator for this is the extin@@ ction of languages .
as any of you were born in this room , 6@@ ,000 languages were spo@@ ken on the continent .
now , a language is not just the whole vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r .
one verb@@ al is appe@@ ar@@ ance of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means that the sou@@ l of a certain culture can find access to the material world .
each language is like an ancient forest of the mind , an el@@ ev@@ ation point , an idea , an ecosystem of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
and today , of these 6@@ ,000 languages , while we &apos;re in mon@@ ter@@ ey , we &apos;re not ba@@ th@@ ed in the e@@ ars of children , half of the children .
you don &apos;t teach kids any more . that means , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what might be more lon@@ ely than being surro@@ unded by the sil@@ ence , to be one of the last people who speak your language , no opportunity to continue the wisdom of ancestors continue , or to expect the hope of children ?
and yet , this horri@@ ble dest@@ in@@ y is actually pul@@ ling every anywhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , every older person dies , and takes the last p@@ ar of an old language to the gra@@ ve .
and i know some of you may say , &quot; well , isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world not a better place , if we all would talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be the language of chil@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s be you kan@@ ke@@ i .
let them be bl@@ i . &quot;
and then you suddenly realized what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so today , i want to kind of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a quick journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to understand to understand you what actually went wrong .
well , there are some among us that are kind of for@@ gotten that if i say &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of his being .
take for example this child of the bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon , the people of an@@ a@@ kon@@ da , they believe that they came up with my@@ th@@ ological the coast of the east from the east , in the bel@@ ly of hol@@ y sh@@ opp@@ ing .
this is a people that doesn &apos;t cogni@@ tively live between the colors of blue and green , because the sky is the forest that people dep@@ end on is equal to .
you have a strange language , and a well-@@ law pres@@ cri@@ ption is called l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : you have to mar@@ ry somebody who spea@@ ks a different language .
all of this ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , and the strange part of these big houses where the ele@@ ction is spo@@ ken six or seven languages , but it &apos;s that you never listen to somebody who learned a language .
they just stop listening and then start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i in ecu@@ deca@@ or , an amazing people who had been cont@@ fac@@ ed in 195@@ 8 in 195@@ 8 .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ary contact tried to record and made a terrible mistake .
they were fil@@ ling out sh@@ ining photos of ou@@ ting out of the air , which we would ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate as a friend@@ ly gest@@ ure , and they for@@ got that these people from the rain@@ forest in their lives had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
they took up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , nothing found and conclu@@ ded that this business diagra@@ m was of de@@ vil , and they killed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries with spe@@ er .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just killed the out@@ come with the spe@@ ers .
they were trans@@ fer@@ red each other .
5@@ 4 percent of the dea@@ ths was di@@ stor@@ ted by re@@ co@@ very .
we went back to the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we ex@@ clu@@ ded people with a little bit about it , they gave that one of the people had been so old that he died because of his age , and we still killed him with spe@@ er .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest , which was quite amazing .
their h@@ unter could smell the ur@@ in@@ ine of an animal from 40 steps away and im@@ pos@@ ing what animal species ow@@ n .
in the early 8@@ 0s , i got a really incredible task when my profess@@ or professor asked me if i was interested in to go to haiti and to in@@ fil@@ tra@@ te the secret societies that the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ ans and clay ma@@ cou@@ tes and the po@@ ison that was used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es safe .
now , to give you a sense of sense , i had to , of course , have to have something about this remarkable faith of vo@@ ki knowledge and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a culture of black magic and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o .
in the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical view .
it &apos;s thri@@ ll@@ ing .
if i were to ask you to record the great world subje@@ cts , what would you say ?
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
a continent is always taken out , because the as@@ pi@@ ration was that in the black africa there is no religious belief , and of course , there was no religious faith , and of course there was a vo@@ o@@ do@@ o of this very profound religious thinking that occur@@ red during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very .
but what vo@@ o@@ do@@ o does so interesting is this vi@@ tal relationship between the living and the dead .
the living sons are the bri@@ g@@ gers .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be tex@@ ted by the big water , answers to the rhyth@@ m of dance to over@@ law the sou@@ l of the living , so that the ac@@ oly@@ th is going to be a short sh@@ ining moment to god to god .
and des@@ uses li@@ kes to say vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists , &quot; your white wal@@ ks to church and talk about god .
we dance in temp@@ le , and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re going to take off by the mind . how can you be used to har@@ m ?
look at this amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ horizon@@ th in a con@@ cen@@ tion , the glo@@ wing coal without a com@@ che@@ ma@@ tion , an amazing illu@@ stration of the ability of the mind to influence the body so that this is keeping into a state when it &apos;s sus@@ pen@@ ded into a state of extreme ar@@ ou@@ sal .
now , of all the people that i met were the kog@@ i from the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia , the most extraordinary one .
the old ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal civilization , who popul@@ ated the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of col@@ om@@ bia , and in con@@ sequence of con@@ qu@@ ination , this population fell back to an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ v that wi@@ ped up above the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ line continent , these people were the only ones who were never con@@ fron@@ ted by the sp@@ ani@@ ards .
until today , they &apos;re gover@@ ned by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , but education to the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is very extraordinary .
the young ac@@ oly@@ es are divi@@ ded by their families at ages three and four years from their families , and in a sha@@ bot@@ y world of pain@@ t@@ ness , in stone hu@@ ts on the lung for 18 years , inten@@ ded in stone hu@@ ts for 18 years , inten@@ ded to mi@@ mic the nine months of preg@@ nan@@ cy that they spent in the la@@ ve of their normal mother , now they spend me@@ tam@@ or@@ ph@@ or@@ ic in the la@@ p of the grand@@ mother .
and throughout this whole period , they &apos;re cul@@ tur@@ ally educ@@ ated into the values of their society , values that pre@@ occu@@ pa@@ te the cla@@ im that their pra@@ yers and only their pra@@ yers , the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we could say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- main@@ tain@@ ing balance .
at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , you &apos;ll suddenly take out one day and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sun@@ rise . and in this cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to be@@ at at the counter of amazing beautiful landscap@@ es , suddenly everything you &apos;ve learned in abstra@@ ct scene , and the pre@@ a@@ cher comes back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really , like i &apos;ve told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they cla@@ im to the older brothers and they say we &apos;re the yo@@ unger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition will be very important .
whenever we think of in the landscape and landscape , we mer@@ ge r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old sk@@ ill of the no@@ ble wil@@ d , which is a ra@@ c@@ table thought , or other th@@ ore@@ au , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so in dom@@ esti@@ c language , they &apos;re not sen@@ ti@@ mental , they &apos;re being g@@ arb@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
it sta@@ ys not a lot of space in the malaria addi@@ ction of as@@ m@@ at or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they still , through time and ritual , sha@@ ped a myster@@ y ni@@ m@@ bur@@ bus of the earth , which is not on the idea of being consci@@ ously close , but on a much more sub@@ tle it@@ em , the idea that the earth can only exist because it becomes dra@@ wn into the human awareness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child is growing from the ones that believe that the mountain is an a@@ pu@@ t spirit that is being an a@@ pu@@ a &apos;s mind that is going to be a very different person , and a different relationship with that resource or that place , as a small child in mon@@ tan@@ a that has grown up in the belief that a mountain can be a bunch of st@@ ones that can get sor@@ ed .
whether or a pi@@ g is a place of a mind or a bunch of exc@@ it@@ ement , is ir@@ relevant .
now , what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of british col@@ oni@@ es , and believe that these fore@@ sts are there to be fla@@ wed .
that led me to another person , as my friends under the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ t@@ l who believe that these fore@@ sts surro@@ unded the hu@@ b of hu@@ ku@@ k and the cro@@ he@@ ged cele@@ bri@@ ties and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ic minds that live on the nor@@ ties of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts that they would invol@@ ve on their ha@@ par@@ sa@@ to jun@@ ting .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reality , you can understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies , for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a picture that i just took up last apri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard , the stron@@ gest of psycho@@ active pri@@ par@@ ate from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of the sha@@ man .
what ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca does so fascinating is not just the pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical matter of this pre@@ par@@ sor , but his process@@ ing . it &apos;s made really made from two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this woo@@ den li@@ an@@ e that &apos;s a series of be@@ pic@@ ine , har@@ m@@ in , har@@ mo@@ lin , little hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ es , min@@ ing . this cli@@ mber plant is like taking on smo@@ ke on her consciousness , but is , however , a blue shot about smo@@ ke on her consciousness , but is mix@@ ed with the leaves of a switch from the coffee plant to the so-@@ named psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
this plant has some very strong tr@@ yp@@ cop@@ es that are very similar to the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ geogra@@ y@@ tr@@ yp@@ ine 5 and techni@@ que and techni@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ o yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in .
if you even saw the y@@ an@@ o@@ po@@ i , how they break this stuff , this sub@@ stance that they also create in various species also are a metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ mic mur@@ abo@@ yp@@ tam@@ in .
so bow@@ ging this po@@ w@@ der is about as much as being broken out of a bar@@ p , ban@@ kli@@ gh@@ ed by b@@ aro@@ que &apos;s pain@@ t@@ ings and the land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not produced di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but it &apos;s the resol@@ ution of reality .
i actually talked to my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ d , the man who introduced the hil@@ che@@ deli@@ an cap@@ re@@ a to discover the ma@@ gical mush@@ rooms in mexico in the &apos; 3@@ 0s , and i argu@@ ed that you could not inclu@@ de these tr@@ yp@@ rus as a hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen , because , in the moment that you feel like you could feel the impact , you &apos;re no longer there to learn a hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is that they can &apos;t be wrong because it will be mod@@ el@@ ed by one in the human condition , of course , in the human condition , of the mon@@ o@@ am@@ in o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase .
they can only be in conne@@ cting with some other chemicals that den@@ ti@@ ze the ma@@ o .
now , the amazing thing is that the po@@ ta@@ vor@@ es that are inclu@@ ded in the li@@ an@@ e , ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are of these kinds of ways that are necessary to affect the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . ask themselves .
how can these people from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of life plants can find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally related plants that , if this way combin@@ ed that way to create a kind of bio@@ chemical version , so that the whole greater is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , try and er@@ ror , what turns out to be meaning@@ less .
but if you ask the indi@@ ans , they said , &quot; the plants are talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 vari@@ ations on the month a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , that you all recognize in the forest at very high dep@@ ths in the forest that our eyes looks like .
and then they asked them how they &apos;re dealing with their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something of plants .
i mean you don &apos;t know anything at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out you take each of the 17 vari@@ ations on full moon , and you &apos;re sing@@ ing to you in a different sche@@ me .
now , this doesn &apos;t get you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than coun@@ ting tri@@ ina .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sym@@ pathy for the difficult position of indi@@ ans , they look like an or@@ g@@ ini@@ ally and color@@ ful , but they sort of nar@@ row on the past , while the real world , that &apos;s our world , is survival .
so the fact is , for the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not for its war or technologi@@ cal innovation , but rather than an era where we were depen@@ dent , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth is either ac@@ tively motiv@@ ated or passi@@ ve . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have involved and over again at the dance with new living .
and the problem is not the technology in itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans don &apos;t hear less on si@@ ou@@ x when they &apos;re hi@@ red and ar@@ row as@@ sign@@ ments when the americans stopped to be americans when they and hor@@ ses of horse .
not change and technology thre@@ ats the integri@@ ty of eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . it &apos;s the ug@@ ly face of the g@@ ad@@ ge@@ um .
and wher@@ ever you look in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not direc@@ ted at the heart . these are dynam@@ ically living people whose existence is being infe@@ cted by adap@@ table forces , like a no@@ ma@@ di@@ ty of sou@@ the@@ ast asia , a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , and now now to a c@@ lon@@ ing real@@ m and pro@@ stit@@ ution at the river floor , from where you can see that even the river is pollu@@ ted with the mu@@ d , who seems to res@@ ha@@ pe nearly hal@@ f-@@ bor@@ ny and pro@@ stit@@ ution at the river floor , where the japanese issues are ready to fill their tro@@ ff@@ ies with ra@@ w trees that they have lost the forest , or the fall of the y@@ an@@ o@@ dor@@ i , where they &apos;re predat@@ cop@@ ed during the forest , or the y@@ an@@ o@@ dor@@ i , where they &apos;re predat@@ cop@@ ed during the gul@@ f .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m a lot of study , you &apos;re going to see the ug@@ ly face of the political domin@@ ance .
you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of people is domin@@ ated by people generally , but the eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of the lives of humans , is not just not only con@@ vi@@ cted , but in general and in many expen@@ ses as part of a develop@@ mental strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of suffering if you don &apos;t experience it on the top of the ground .
i travel@@ ed with a young collea@@ gue , 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a , and only when i saw l@@ has@@ a came to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear : 6@@ ,000 sa@@ und mon@@ u@@ ents that were turned in ru@@ g@@ ger and as@@ hes . 1.@@ 2 million people who were killed by the c@@ attle .
the father of this young man was identi@@ fied as the follo@@ wers of the she@@ ep lam@@ a .
that meant that he had been killed while the chinese invasi@@ on was killed .
his un@@ cle was@@ h with her hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , people brought to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was lo@@ cked in , as pun@@ pun@@ ish@@ ment to be -- to be weal@@ thy .
he was s@@ mu@@ ed in ja@@ il at the age of two , to hi@@ de under her rock cr@@ y@@ st@@ als , because she couldn &apos;t live him .
the nur@@ se who were commit@@ ted these bra@@ ve exercise was brought into an edu@@ cational camp .
she went on one day on a wri@@ t of ma@@ os , and for that pro@@ motion , she had to go to a sever@@ e work@@ shop for seven years .
the suffering can be in@@ toler@@ able , but the joy of people &apos;s in@@ ability is something un@@ for@@ ge@@ ous .
and in the end , we really are in front of a choice . do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony , or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , who was great anthropo@@ log@@ ist , said before she died that it was her greatest fear that as we move down toward a thre@@ ad , ligh@@ ted , gener@@ ic world@@ view , we would be re@@ duced not only the over@@ range of human imagination in a ti@@ ed way , but that we were wa@@ king out of a dream , and for@@ gotten that there was no possibility of other possibilities .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species may have exi@@ sted for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment the cul@@ t of the dream of the dream , which brought the sha@@ man through the pro@@ fil@@ e of pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od and hier@@ arch@@ y , speci@@ alization and created -- only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is har@@ dly 300 years old .
now , this super@@ mal story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all answers to the challenges we face in the next mil@@ len@@ nia .
if we ask this low-@@ conflict world culture for the importance of human beings , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : people with ex@@ ternal consciousness that &apos;s aware of the importance that all people and gar@@ dens have to be rel@@ ated to a room , and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
this is a photograph i took in the northern end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands , when i went to in@@ u@@ ge@@ em with in@@ u@@ dies , and this man , ol@@ ay@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ adi@@ an government didn &apos;t always round very well with the in@@ u@@ it , and during the 50@@ s years on the const@@ it@@ u@@ ation of our return , they were forced to pull in in sett@@ le@@ ments .
the grand@@ father of this old man re@@ f@@ used .
the family , hun@@ gry about his life , took him all the g@@ uns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the in@@ u@@ it didn &apos;t have fear of the cold , they used it to their advantage .
the contr@@ es of their clo@@ set were origin@@ ally made out of fish that were wra@@ pped in the car@@ ke skin .
man &apos;s grand@@ father didn &apos;t fear the arc@@ tic ev@@ ening or the land@@ ing stor@@ m .
he &apos;d come out , he &apos;d let his pants out of the sea la@@ ke fu@@ r , de@@ fe@@ ated in his hand , and when the fe@@ ces started free@@ zing , he formed them in the form of a cli@@ cker .
he spra@@ yed tru@@ cks on the sides of the block cop@@ ers , and when it &apos;s completely fro@@ zen , he stun@@ ly sho@@ ast@@ ed a dog .
he put the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a sha@@ ke , took the skelet@@ on of the dog , impro@@ vis@@ ed a bright , tor@@ tured a sle@@ t@@ led , quot@@ ed another dog , and de@@ cre@@ asing over the ice pen@@ cil with the fe@@ e@@ der kni@@ fe on the mountain b@@ elt .
that &apos;s nothing like that to do out of nothing .
and this is a symbol of a symbol of the resi@@ stance of in@@ u@@ it and of all of the cont@@ amin@@ ants in the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government rele@@ ased the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l in apri@@ l 199@@ 9 , 199@@ 9 left back to the area that was larger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home@@ town and says n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ak@@ er .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control the miner@@ al .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , that can look at it can look and achie@@ ve with its own people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve gone to these dist@@ ant goals on the earth to realize that they &apos;re not going to be away at all .
you &apos;re the wel@@ f@@ are countries of somebody .
they represent parts of human imagination that goes back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children will be part of our own children &apos;s geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope .
what we &apos;ve done at geographic geographic is that we think politicians are never reach@@ ing anything .
we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs is not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we believe that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best institution for story@@ telling in the world , and our website hands 35 million other minds every month .
15@@ 6 nations recor@@ ding our tv chan@@ nel .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions of people .
and we are doing a series of travel into the eth@@ no@@ sphere that we take our audience to places of these cultural belie@@ vers that they &apos;re worth from the familiar fl@@ ans , and hopefully , they &apos;re going to adop@@ t one after the time the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in different ways that we can a life opportunity in a really mul@@ tic@@ ory p@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic world , in which the wisdom of all people can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
thank you very much .
what i &apos;m first going to show you , first as quickly as possible is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have left microsoft as part of a transition ago , which is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either deal with just a huge or far amount of visual data .
we see a lot , a lot of gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes here that you take se@@ am@@ less and progress , che@@ ating , in any way , to re-@@ ar@@ ran@@ ged .
and it &apos;s no matter how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these colle@@ ctions are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital ima@@ gery of a camera , but this is , for example , a map from the library library , and it &apos;s in a range of 300 to@@ g@@ ap@@ s .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that can nar@@ row the performance of a system like this is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen in every moment , and it also has a very flexi@@ ble architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-@@ recor@@ ds data .
this is b@@ le@@ k house of di@@ ck@@ ens . every sp@@ ill@@ ar is a chap@@ ter .
to prove that it really really is about a text , and not about an image , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the tex@@ ts and no picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is a copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
every big picture is the beginning of a clas@@ h .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience is to read a real pa@@ tho@@ r of a magazine or a newspaper , which is in a kind of partner@@ ship with several orders of scale .
and we also did something at the corner of this particular copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong hin@@ t with very high resol@@ ution design that &apos;s much higher than at a normal ad , and we &apos;ve ad@@ ded addi@@ tional content .
if you &apos;d want to see the fun@@ ctions of this car , you can see you here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
and this really meas@@ ures these ideas to ero@@ de this con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts to the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is no po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other non@@ sense more -- it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time not to say that we &apos;re going to be contribu@@ ting to this area .
but these are all roads in the u.@@ s@@ .@@ a .
over@@ bor@@ dly , on the top of nasa &apos;s mel@@ d-@@ sha@@ ped picture .
so let &apos;s take something else out .
this is even live on the internet now . you can te@@ sted it .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really conne@@ cts two different technologies together .
the one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which from no@@ ah pin@@ net , a university student in washington , under the coun@@ sel@@ ing of steve od@@ tz at u@@ v .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i of microsoft research has been done . a very good collaboration .
and so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you can see this , when we create these kinds of insi@@ ghts where we can break through images and make this experience of a lot of tri@@ ma@@ ce .
but the spa@@ tial meas@@ ures of the images is actually important .
the computer visi@@ on algorith@@ ms have decided these images so they decided to be the real room in which these images that were all made near the gras@@ s@@ i pi@@ cks in the can@@ adi@@ an rock , and you see these elements here of stabili@@ zed sli@@ kes or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things were hu@@ gely related to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are those who are much more spac@@ eless .
i &apos;d like to just share one of the original data sets of no@@ ah , and that &apos;s from a early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we &apos;ve been working for the first time in summer to show you what i believe is really the poin@@ ted behind this technology , of photo@@ syn@@ thetic technology , and that &apos;s not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the law@@ yers , so we had to worry .
this is a ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral sche@@ c@@ ology of ca@@ the@@ dr@@ ot@@ re d@@ ame , who was currently experim@@ ent in the computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r . just give them ton@@ re d@@ ame in fli@@ ck@@ r , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-@@ shir@@ ts and in the university site , each of this orange c@@ one represents a picture that has been discovered in this model .
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;re all places that are in relation to each other .
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to end up working on microsoft .
and i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for the re@@ ception here .
and i sus@@ pe@@ ct you can see that there are a lot of different kinds of c@@ ameras : everything is all done by the mobile si@@ d to professional sl@@ ress , a pretty large number of them that have been wir@@ ed up in this environment .
and if possible , i will find some of the weird curi@@ es .
many of them are covered by faces and and so forth .
so somewhere here , there are a number of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by not@@ re d@@ ame , which was very recor@@ ded .
we can start to change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can make things with social environments , now it &apos;s colle@@ cted data from all of all -- from the whole collective memory of how , visu@@ ally the earth looks -- and everything is connected .
all these pictures are lin@@ ked together , and there are something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that gener@@ ates out of the whole earth .
consider this as the sequ@@ el of the work of ste@@ phen law@@ l@@ ers on virtual earth .
and this is something that through the complexity that people use it , and their use for the user to increasingly grow with the app@@ lic@@ ation .
your own photos are chur@@ ned with a meta@@ data that has given a different person .
if someone has done the wisdom , and told all these sac@@ red who they are , then my photo from the not@@ re ber@@ na ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly tries with all this data , and i can use it as a starting point to bridge in this space , into these meta@@ hospitals , that use photos of other people , and therefore make a kind of cros@@ s-@@ trans@@ fer model with other families , and have a kind of cros@@ s-@@ trans@@ fer model with others use by others .
and of course , th@@ ie@@ p products are all the huge virtual virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that have been recei@@ ved not just by over@@ stre@@ t@@ ched or satelli@@ te images and stuff , but by collective memory .
thank you very much .
do i hi@@ re you ? your software allows that , at some point in the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world are fundament@@ ally mes@@ h together ?
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything else than dete@@ cted .
if you want to create them hyper@@ links between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting , if you think about the loss of the se@@ man@@ ese information that many of these pictures have .
what if you take a web search for images , where you type in sent@@ ences , and the text of the website con@@ tains a lot of information about what &apos;s the picture .
but what about if the picture conne@@ cts it with all your images ?
but then the range of se@@ man@@ tic string bon@@ ds and the l@@ ength that makes it out is really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart toler@@ ation .
so thank you very much .
so i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book that , i hope , are in mind with other things you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to create even some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i &apos;d like to start with what i call &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , of what ?
the offi@@ cial belie@@ val of all western industri@@ alized societies .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma works like this : if our obje@@ ctive is ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the public good of our citizens , this is especially by ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing freedom of the individuals .
the reason that freedom is good in itself is value , wor@@ th@@ ful , a na@@ tive desire for human beings .
when people have freedom , all of us will be for yourself to do the things that ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our public good , and no one has any to decide for us .
the journey to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deeply that it would be so deep in our water supply , that it would not come in the mind .
and it &apos;s also been ro@@ ot@@ ed deeply in our lives .
so i &apos;m going to give you a few examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my super@@ market . it &apos;s not a big one .
i just want to brie@@ fly say a little bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
there are 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ ses in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t inclu@@ de the 10 different photo@@ o@@ vir@@ o@@ es , and 12 bal@@ sc@@ i@@ o rich@@ ly that you could buy to make a big number of your own sal@@ at des@@ f , in the un@@ likely case that none of the 17@@ 5 in the store is for them .
so this is , you know , the super@@ market .
and then you go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics business to put a stere@@ o plant -- lou@@ d@@ ji@@ , c@@ d player , a c@@ asse@@ tte player , a c@@ asse@@ tte player , radio , am@@ pli@@ fi@@ er , and in this one electr@@ on@@ ics business there are so many stere@@ o .
we can assem@@ ble 6@@ .@@ 5 million different stere@@ o fun@@ ds out of the components that are off@@ ered in this one business .
you have to ad@@ mit that that &apos;s a big sele@@ ction .
in other real@@ ms , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have every phone provi@@ der that you wanted , as long as it came from fashion sla@@ very .
they r@@ ented your phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . sun bought it .
one ep@@ iso@@ de of that was that the tele@@ phone was never broken .
so these days are over .
we have almost an infin@@ ite sele@@ ction of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile mobile phones in the future .
my favorite is that in the middle -- mp@@ 3 play@@ -@@ and-@@ player , earth@@ -@@ ha@@ ir@@ tri@@ cles and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ am l@@ é@@ e spe@@ sh@@ e .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that far yet in your business , you can be sure you &apos;ll soon be able to do it .
and what it does is it brings people to run into the business and ask this question .
now , do you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell@@ phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying of objects , the same explosion of choice is capable of the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that the doctor is doing to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a thing or we could make b .
a has these advan@@ tages and some risks .
b has these pre@@ c@@ ision and risks . what do you want to do ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what do you want me to do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a jo@@ ke has these advan@@ tages and risks and b has these advan@@ tages and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not one of them . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &quot; autonom@@ y . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the bur@@ den of responsibility for someone who knows something -- nam@@ ely the doctor -- to someone who knows something -- nam@@ ely the doctor -- to someone that knows nothing and not in the best const@@ it@@ ution is not to make a decision -- nam@@ ely the patient .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption medi@@ cin@@ es for people like you and me , which if they think about it , they don &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do we ga@@ ther care about ourselves if we can &apos;t buy it ?
the answer is : they expect to call us the doctor the next morning and ask a change of the pres@@ cri@@ ption .
something so deep as our identity is now a question of choice of how this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t preser@@ ve identity , we inv@@ ent them .
and we &apos;re trying to inv@@ ent as often as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everybody had one , and they could get them married as quickly as they could , and then kids would get as fast as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who , not when , and not what they did after after@@ wards .
today , everything is quite easy to have .
i teach wonderful smart students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i once did .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less care@@ ful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re bus@@ y with other things , they &apos;re asking themselves , &quot; should i mar@@ ry or not ? should i be as@@ sing ?
should i be married later ? should i have children , or should i just make career for me ? &quot;
they &apos;re all invi@@ ting questions .
and you &apos;ll hear these questions matter whether it means all the tas@@ ks that i in@@ tend to get and don &apos;t get good details in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to ans@@ wer@@ ing questions .
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed , like car@@ l illu@@ str@@ ates , with the material that allows us every minute to work on the planet every single place from every place on the planet -- except for the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
over , by the way , there &apos;s a corner i &apos;m going to tell you about where the wir@@ el@@ ess@@ day works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this tremendous freedom of choice we have to make decisions in terms of work , again and again , whether we should work or don &apos;t should work .
we can look at our kids in the foot@@ ball , and we have our cell phones on the one a hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on other hi@@ p , and we probably sell our laptop on our la@@ p .
and even if you &apos;re all jum@@ ped , every minute in which we look at our kids in the mu@@ ti@@ b@@ pool of a soc@@ cer game , we also ask , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this e-@@ mail ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and also , if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it will certainly be your experience of the foot@@ ball game very different than it would have been .
anywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
and with that , i want to say there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re living in now looks like this .
and the question is , is the good news or bad news ?
and the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m about to talk about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on human beings .
so one of the consequences , parado@@ x@@ ical way , is that it &apos;s paraly@@ zing paraly@@ zing .
with so many op@@ tions that you can choose from , it kee@@ ps people very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another dra@@ stic example of , a study about invest@@ ing in volunte@@ er reti@@ re@@ ment .
a collea@@ gue of mine had access to investment recor@@ ds of van@@ gu@@ ard , the giant f@@ on@@ es of about a million employees , and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found per 10 investment fund that the emplo@@ yer off@@ ered , the participa@@ tion took by two percent .
they offer 50 investment to -- 10 percent less employees do -- 10 percent less employees than if they were just off@@ ered five . why ?
because there are 50 investment direc@@ tions that are the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to choose to sho@@ ot it at tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and morning morning , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , and tomorrow come never .
understand that this is not just that people have to eat dog food when they go to reti@@ re@@ ment , because they don &apos;t have enough money to back back , it means making decisions so hard that they miss great investment supp@@ lies of their emplo@@ yers .
through that no participa@@ tion , it gives you up to 5,000 u.s. a year on the work@@ student who would have been happy to re@@ produce their contribu@@ tion .
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of a lot of choices .
and i think it &apos;s a sense of the fact that the world looks like this .
they really want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all the e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
you don &apos;t want to choose the fal@@ se app@@ le@@ ments , or even the wrong sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we get over the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end less satis@@ fied with the out@@ comes of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide ourselves between less possibilities .
and there are a couple of reasons for this .
one of them is determin@@ ed by the big sal@@ es of a different sal@@ at@@ box , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ aster is doing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to find another decision that would have been better . and what happens is this amazing idea leads them to re@@ gre@@ t the decision , and that re@@ gre@@ ts seem negative to the satis@@ fac@@ tion that they had of their gest@@ ed choice even when it was a good decision .
the more possibility there is , the easier it is to re@@ gre@@ t at all that &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting for the choices that they make .
secon@@ dly , what econom@@ ists call op@@ per@@ on cost .
dan gil@@ bert made a big point of morning this morning by telling how much the way we ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate things , depen@@ ding on what we contr@@ ast it .
well , when there are many alterna@@ tives to consider , it &apos;s simply attra@@ ctive to imagine attra@@ ctive tra@@ its of alterna@@ tives that you end up with , it makes you less satis@@ fied with the alterna@@ tives that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
now here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what you would have thought .
here &apos;s a couple at the ham@@ p@@ tons .
very expensive real e@@ state .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; gu@@ ard , the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
everybody in my web distri@@ ct is gone .
i could par@@ k right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spent two weeks from the thoughts that he failed to have vot@@ ed the possibility , day over day , a great par@@ king lot .
op@@ per@@ are@@ based cost is growing the happiness that we gain by our choice even when what we cho@@ se was fantastic .
and the more possibility there is to sele@@ ction , the more attra@@ ctive properties of these sele@@ ction are consi@@ der@@ ing into the op@@ per@@ on cost .
now , here &apos;s another example .
now , this carto@@ on is doing some stat@@ ements .
he &apos;s doing a stat@@ ement about living now in the right , and maybe as well as doing things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is : always who you choose for a thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things may have many attra@@ ctive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re doing to do less .
three , em@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
this was what happened to me when i wanted to exchange my je@@ ans .
i &apos;m wearing je@@ ans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only je@@ ans of a kind , and they bought her , and they made it bad , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wor@@ n them long enough and they &apos;d often was@@ hed enough , they have started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
so i went to buy new je@@ ans after a lot of years of com@@ ment , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the counter man said , &quot; would you like to take a bag , a ligh@@ tly fer@@ ro@@ m or a distance ?
do you want to was@@ h butt@@ ons or ti@@ l@@ sy ? stone or ac@@ id ?
do you want to g@@ ans at l@@ ans ?
you want to cut far on the bottom , ke@@ et , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; and so on he said .
my ja@@ w was down , and after i got married , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the kind of guy who used to be the only species . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour so that all of the dam@@ n je@@ ans to try and give the business -- and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- with the best run je@@ ans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had it better . all this anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ent led me to do better .
but i was worse feeling .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try it myself to expla@@ ining it myself
the reason that i felt bad with all these available resources , my expec@@ tations for what it was worth for a good couple je@@ ans , went up .
i had very low expec@@ tations . i had no con@@ cre@@ te expec@@ tations than they could only have in a kind of a way .
when they came in 100 species , frank@@ ly , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got good was , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i expected to , and what i had expected was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison with what i was expected .
the inclu@@ ding of opportunities in the lives of the people inevi@@ ted inevi@@ t@@ ably the expec@@ tations that people will have this opportunity .
and that leads to less satis@@ fac@@ tion with the results , even when the results are good .
no one in the training world knows this , because , if you would , because if you would , everybody don &apos;t know what it was about .
the truth is more like that here .
the reason is that it was anything better than anything worse than anything , when everything was worse , it was possible for people to make experience that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we are weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , perfe@@ ction -- the best for an expec@@ tation -- the best for which you can never hope , things are as good as you &apos;re expected to .
you never pleas@@ ed because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , are hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , home@@ up .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what all of you have come -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
i want to say -- a short auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phic moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really , very wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t ab@@ and@@ on myself .
but ab@@ use isn &apos;t always that mean of a bad thing .
finally , an out@@ come of the buying of a bad sitting je@@ ans if there is only one way to buy is that if you &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . &apos; the world is responsible . what would you have done ?
when hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and they buy one that &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
and it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans in the front of the board , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about , they acc@@ use themselves .
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant comp@@ actor with this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experienced the dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment because their standards are so high , because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think it would be their fau@@ lt .
and so the refle@@ ction is that it &apos;s generally better , it &apos;s radi@@ cally better , and we feel bad .
so let me re@@ mind you .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , which one we all think about cor@@ rec@@ tly is wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than any choice than zero , but it doesn &apos;t follow that much more choice than something .
there &apos;s a ma@@ gi@@ cal amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve mis@@ sed that place a long time to improve our collective interests .
now , as a basic question -- i &apos;m nearly done -- as a basic issue , the thing about thinking about how all of that ele@@ ction is en@@ ab@@ led in the industri@@ alized societies , the material is wealth .
there are a lot of places in the world , and we heard about many of them whose problem is not that big sele@@ ction .
and your problem is they have too little .
so , the things that i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and suff@@ oc@@ ent : steve le@@ vi@@ tt has told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard to have car se@@ ats not to help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they &apos;re actually doing .
they worry about what we &apos;re bad at .
if something of what makes people of our society allow so to make decisions to the societies that people would have too little choice , not just impro@@ ving people &apos;s lives , but our dig@@ ni@@ ty will also be impro@@ ved .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ vement .
income distribution will make it make everybody better -- not just the poor -- because all of this big sele@@ ction gives us a pla@@ in .
finally , read this carto@@ on , and read this carto@@ on , and , you know , a very educ@@ ated person , says , &quot; ah ! what doesn &apos;t know ?
you don &apos;t know it &apos;s possible in this gold@@ fish glass . &quot;
terri@@ fied fan@@ t@@ asy , a shor@@ t-@@ term view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to think of it , the fish came something white .
because the truth is , when you break the ic@@ fish glass , everything is possible , they don &apos;t have any freedom . they have paraly@@ sis .
if you break the ic@@ fish glass , so that everything is possible , they send happiness .
they slowly slow the paraly@@ sis and they get happiness .
everybody needs an ic@@ fish glass .
this is almost limited to complete security -- poten@@ tially for the fish , definitely for us .
but the thi@@ ck of it is from a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ fish glass glass is a reci@@ pe for ad@@ ding , and i sus@@ pe@@ ct of disaster .
thank you very much indeed .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology by creating new life and build .
we &apos;ve always been trying to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i believe that a lot of bi@@ ologists tried to understand and that based on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approach@@ es to simpli@@ fy it with minim@@ ic components .
we op@@ pli@@ c@@ ated almost 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , we sequen@@ ced the transition from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology to the digital world of biology .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , can we re@@ generate life , or whether we can create new life , out of this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma fer@@ tal@@ ari@@ za@@ city , that has the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do it with a smaller genome .
we went to expe@@ ct it to about a hundred genes of the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , which is very simple to us , compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s easy . but if we look at all of these genes that we can elimin@@ ate one after the other , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that this is the only way to actually eventually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some , that we allow us to vari@@ ate the individual components , and to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started asking with the question , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
is it able to make the chemistry make these really big molecules that never has been made before ?
so , if we can do that , can we start the chromo@@ some ?
a chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of chemical material .
our steps in the di@@ c@@ ution of life were exponenti@@ al .
our ability to write genetic code has been evol@@ ving very slowly , but it &apos;s still increasing , and our lat@@ est point would now be put on an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
we started . we started 15 years ago .
in fact , it took a few years earlier with a bio@@ eth@@ ical stat@@ ement before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out dna syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zation is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world can make the small bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process , the longer you make a piece , the more mistake they &apos;re going to happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could assem@@ ble these little pieces and we could cor@@ rect the er@@ ror .
this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria killing bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we got this piece in@@ ert chemical , and gave it into a bacteria , and the bacteri@@ um started reading the genetic code and made vi@@ ral particles .
the vi@@ ral particles were then rele@@ ased by the cells , and came back and killed e@@ . col@@ i .
so , recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they seemed to stop this model .
and they laugh@@ ed more than you do here .
so , we think that this is a situation in the software to actually build your hard@@ ware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot . we wanted to build an entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some . it has more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters genetic code . so we thought , we &apos;re building it in ta@@ pe from the size of the virus to understand what the individual compon@@ ent of a living cell are .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really fau@@ l@@ g@@ free .
when we first sequen@@ ced the genome in 199@@ 5 , the er@@ ror rate in a mistake was per 10,000 pa@@ irs .
so we found 30 mistakes tra@@ ding , and if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and over@@ la@@ pping with 50@@ 0-@@ letter elements to build smaller sub-@@ un@@ its so that you fit smaller sub-@@ un@@ its together to fit those together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve put water@@ sig@@ ns in .
think about it : we have a four@@ -@@ letter code : a , a , c , g and t .
these letters -- these letters co@@ ating about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phr@@ ase , thoughts .
ini@@ tially , we just sig@@ ned sig@@ ned .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
we engine@@ ered the pieces so that we could just cra@@ p them with enzy@@ mes , and there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them back together .
and we &apos;ve started to create pieces , starting with pieces that con@@ tain five to seven thousand letters , put them together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter bits to put it back together , up to 7@@ 2,000 .
in each step , we had these pieces in return to produce them , because we tried to sequence them , because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of the auto@@ ma@@ tion .
so this , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball bil@@ yo@@ ff .
if we get these really large st@@ ones -- with over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- then they &apos;re not just going to grow in e@@ . col@@ i . it &apos;s increasing all the possibility of modern molecular biology , and so we turn ourselves to other mechanis@@ ms .
we knew from a mechan@@ ism of the hom@@ ologist re@@ per@@ cent that uses biology to re@@ pair dna that can together together together that could assem@@ ble these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that &apos;s bas@@ o@@ dur@@ ic that &apos;s three million whe@@ els of radiation
you can see in the upp@@ er board , his chromo@@ some just dro@@ ps apart .
for 12 to 24 hours later , everything has re@@ turned to the same way as it was .
so we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely blo@@ wn up , they can actually live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life is in space and can move towards , in search of a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there is a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a found of the molecule that we made using these processes using this process -- actually , we &apos;ve used he@@ ating mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces of the pieces , we fit it . ye@@ ast , it auto@@ matically acceler@@ ates it together .
this is not a scan@@ ning electr@@ on scan@@ ning , it &apos;s a regular microscop@@ ic .
it &apos;s such a big molecule , that we can even see it with the light microscop@@ e .
this is over a six seconds &apos; time .
that &apos;s the publi@@ cation that we &apos;ve just done recently .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with absolute structure that has ever been created by people .
it &apos;s got a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we could print it with a newspaper size of 10 and without circum@@ stances , it would inclu@@ de 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we start a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also as easier when you in to@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ites like we &apos;re doing , you just take the nu@@ cle@@ us out and you have another in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re all talking about at the kl@@ on .
arch@@ a@@ e@@ bacteria , integr@@ ated the chromo@@ some into the cell , but just recently , we showed that you can transp@@ l@@ ant a complete transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ som@@ es from one cell to the other and it can activ@@ ate it .
we placed the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ bes species . well , roughly these two lines as humans and mi@@ ce . we gave some extra genes to get this chromo@@ some . we put it with enzy@@ mes to be destro@@ ying this chromo@@ some . we put it with enzy@@ mes to destro@@ y all the proteins . and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell -- and they &apos;re valu@@ ed our very exten@@ ded mathemati@@ cs here .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring the process on a little bit .
and this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have a second chromo@@ some , or a third of any subject , thousands of fol@@ ds every time , every time you add thousands of characters in just a second .
so people who represent evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time has a lot of mis@@ sed by biology .
there are enzy@@ mes the restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes are called dna that are actually di@@ mming dna .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell was not one ; the chromo@@ som@@ es that we &apos;ve put in .
it was expres@@ sed out in the cell , and it appreci@@ ated the other chromo@@ some as alien material , and so we had only one cell with a new chromo@@ some .
it made blue because of the genes that we had em@@ bed@@ ded .
and after a very short period of time , it lost all the characteri@@ stics of species and completely conver@@ ted into a new species on the new software that we gave up into the cell .
all the proteins changed the mem@@ bran@@ es -- when we las@@ ed the genetic code , that was exactly what we trans@@ fer@@ red .
it may sound genom@@ ic al@@ ch@@ happen , but we can use by shif@@ ting the software dna , changing things quite dra@@ matically .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that this is not a gen@@ es@@ is -- that &apos;s based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we might be able to create a new kind of cam@@ str@@ ic explosion , where there might be massive new education education based on this digital design .
so why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re growing from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my own context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
today , three people on this planet are three people on this planet for everybody that has exi@@ sted in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , they &apos;ll be four years .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medical water , shel@@ ves for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to create a challenge that &apos;s going to offer for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0-@@ plus billion bar@@ rel@@ s of oil . this is a hundred million off@@ ers a day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there is the whole co2 from this material that land@@ ed in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our disco@@ disco@@ zation from all over the world , a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe in this belief that these are the design components of the future .
the electr@@ on@@ ter industry had a do@@ zen components , and look at the diversity that came out of it .
we end here pri@@ mar@@ ily about the limit@@ s of biological reality and those of our imagination .
we have technologies today based on this fast syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing techni@@ que to do what we call combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gene@@ tics .
so we now have the ability to build a large robot that can make a million of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
if you think about making these 20 million different genes , or optimi@@ zing this process to make oc@@ do@@ st , or drug new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can change more molecular biology with the last 20 years of science than the last 20 years of science
and it &apos;s just a second sele@@ ction . we can sele@@ ct li@@ ability , we can sele@@ ct energy , production of chemicals or fuel production and so on .
this is a picture of actual design software that we &apos;re working on that you &apos;re actually putting together and designing new species on computers .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how to look like it &apos;s going . we know exactly what its genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re foc@@ using on the green@@ - of the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve recently seen cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol what &apos;s just a bad experiment .
we have the green@@ - of the second and third generation that will come out pretty soon that are going to have much higher so@@ verage , like oc@@ ch or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but , as we think that the only way with biology is a huge impact without any amount of increase in food or limit@@ ation of their avail@@ ability , when we see co2 as a source of material , and that &apos;s why we work to cells that go this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first carb@@ on-@@ gener@@ ated of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s in about 18 months .
sun@@ light and co2 are a way .
and now in our disco@@ disco@@ sts of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organis@@ m that we &apos;ve described in 199@@ 6 .
it lives in the deep sea , about a quar@@ ter and a half miles deep , in nearly cooking water temper@@ atures .
it conver@@ ts co2 in me@@ than@@ e as a source of hydro@@ gen as a source source .
we &apos;re explor@@ ing whether we can use pollu@@ ted co2 , which could just be used to regu@@ late the co2 in fuel to drive this process in fuel to power this process .
in a short period of time , we believe that we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moder@@ ates goals like the re@@ plac@@ ement of the whole pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry , exactly . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? one-@@ main source of energy .
but that &apos;s how we &apos;re currently working on appl@@ ying the same approach@@ es for the development of vac@@ cin@@ es .
you &apos;ve seen this one year with flu , we &apos;re always a year left , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
i think that this can be changed by building re@@ combin@@ ant vac@@ cin@@ es in the interests .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes , today , the evolutionary tree is acceler@@ ated with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ es , and possibly eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ites .
we are blind years of impro@@ ving people to improve people , and our goal is just that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i promis@@ ed back to them , to expla@@ ining how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of those who didn &apos;t exist at all at that time , the l@@ h@@ c is the biggest scientific experiment that ever was stopped -- 27 miles in diam@@ e@@ ter .
the job is to create the conditions that exi@@ sted less than a billi@@ on@@ th of the universe in the beginning of the universe -- and it went up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ taking ambi@@ tious .
this is the machine under gen@@ ev@@ a .
we take images of these mini@@ -@@ big ban@@ ks in dete@@ c@@ tors .
that &apos;s what i work at . he calls up at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters in the base , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
here &apos;s a spec@@ tac@@ ular picture of the at@@ las in the construction so you can see the scale .
on the 10@@ th of september year , the machine went for the first time .
and this picture was recor@@ ded by at@@ las .
it gener@@ ated novel ju@@ g@@ ks in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first str@@ aus@@ y partic@@ le that came back the entire distance around the l@@ h@@ c , then given part of the l@@ h@@ c part to put a rain of particles on the dete@@ ctor .
in other words , when we saw this picture on the 10@@ th of september , we knew that machine works , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph .
i don &apos;t know if this made the biggest ju@@ ek , or this one , when somebody went to the google side and found the front of the paper .
it means that we get reach@@ ed a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had done with these wir@@ et@@ et -- this golden wir@@ ing here here .
these wir@@ es take 13@@ -@@ thousand cu@@ ps when this machine is head@@ ing up at high power .
well , the engineers who are going to look at you and say , &quot; no you don &apos;t do that . these are little wir@@ es . &quot;
they can afford that , because if you cool@@ ed them very far , they become called super@@ conduc@@ tors .
so with min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the room between the stars , these wir@@ es can keep the ten@@ sion .
in one of the connections , between over the nin@@ e-@@ thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a shi@@ ec@@ te@@ ing fe@@ eding .
it suddenly heat the wir@@ es of low , and 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ p@@ bers en@@ counter@@ ed electrical resi@@ stance .
this was the out@@ come .
now , this is even more impres@@ sive if you imagine that the mag@@ net wei@@ gh@@ s over 20 tons and distribu@@ ted about 30 centi@@ meters .
so , we hi@@ red about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
and i had to re@@ move them what we did .
we re@@ com@@ men@@ ded them , re@@ pair it .
so , they &apos;re all back on their way back .
by the end of mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be oper@@ able again .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and expect to collect first data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and we continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way of enti@@ ting such acci@@ dents , again , the debate is about the value of science and engineering on such boundar@@ ies . it &apos;s easy to re@@ je@@ ct such something like that .
i think that it &apos;s so hard to remember the fact that we take beyond our limit@@ ations , creating the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i &apos;m going to give my conclu@@ sive words to a english scientist . hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , i think , when he defen@@ ded the us@@ eless experiments of his teaching , his teaching michael was michael far@@ a@@ day , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human spirit than to believe that our scientific imagination is bad , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ a are immedi@@ ate , and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
thank you very much .
i &apos;m a no@@ ve@@ list .
so writing books is my job , but it &apos;s , of course , more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life@@ -@@ long love and fascin@@ ation .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change .
however , funny of something weird in my life and my career has happened that has made me completely re@@ think my relationship with this work .
this strange event was that recently i wrote a book -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called two , pra@@ y , love , pra@@ y , love -- that , in fact , i discovered , but all my previous books came out of the world , and a big me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , international s@@ eller thing became .
the result is that , no matter where i come from , as though i &apos;m establi@@ sh@@ ed to the under@@ ground .
seriously , it &apos;s driven off the road !
for example , you &apos;ll be worried to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to miss this success ?
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to pass your whole life and never create a book that interest someone in the world ? never again ? watch ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes it really .
it would be worse though , if i didn &apos;t remember that i was talking about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager for the first time , that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of an@@ gry response .
people said , don &apos;t you fear to succe@@ ed on it ?
do you not fear that you use a vote to order of a vote ?
don &apos;t you worry that this cra@@ ve your life went out of this cra@@ ve of your life and never comes out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a fri@@ p@@ per@@ y dreams -- your mouth filled with the bit@@ ter a@@ hn of failure ?
that &apos;s how , you know .
and the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , look , yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of all these things .
and i always had .
and i sc@@ ared a lot more stuff that would no one would get hurt .
how al@@ ga@@ e -- and other fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things .
but when it &apos;s writing writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , and i &apos;ve been asking myself , why
is that sensi@@ ble ?
is it logi@@ cal that someone should expect that he was afraid to do the work that he was getting to do ?
and what &apos;s the thing about the creative business that they &apos;re inse@@ cting us un@@ certain about the individual spirit of psychiat@@ ric -- in a way how other professi@@ ons don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist that he was asked if he was afraid to be chemi@@ sts .
with your chem@@ ist block@@ ade , john -- how do you do with it ?
it just wasn &apos;t going to know , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chem@@ ist has not gotten the repu@@ tation over the cent@@ u@@ ries over the cent@@ u@@ ries of al@@ co@@ hol depres@@ sing people .
we also , we seem to have this type of call , but not only the wri@@ ters , but the crea@@ tives of all gen@@ ru@@ es seems to have this repu@@ tation , ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
all you have to do is to look at the bit@@ ter death numbers from really great vot@@ ing alone from the 20th century that died young and often died by their own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually deliver su@@ i@@ cide , they seemed to be really ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted by their tal@@ ents .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er just said before his death in his last interview : sting every one of my books has killed me a little bit .
an extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can do about your life work .
but we don &apos;t even pause when we hear somebody like this , because we know this kind of thing for so long time , we have the notion so bro@@ ad and collective , we have the notion so bro@@ ad and colle@@ c@@ tively accep@@ ting that creativity and suffering -- at the end -- always leads to the sou@@ l qu@@ art .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask everybody that &apos;s here today is : is this idea for you right ?
are you feeling about it ? because with just a centi@@ meter down -- i &apos;m not comfortable with this notion at all .
i think they &apos;re te@@ di@@ ous .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see it being taken to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re living our great creative education .
and i know , for me , that it &apos;s -- in my situation -- very dangerous to begin to start this dark path of concern@@ s , especially in the context that i &apos;m just present in my career .
that means -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i &apos;ve probably got another 40 working years in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m writing from now is that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world as a work , which came after the term success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;ll tell you right now , because we &apos;re all kind of friends now -- it &apos;s highly likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jes@@ us , what &apos;s thought for a thought !
this is the kind of thoughts that can make someone to start drin@@ king 9 in the morning , drin@@ king g@@ in , and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d like to stay away with this work that i love .
and so , the question is : how ?
after a while of obser@@ ving , i seem to think that to continue writing , i have to continue to design some kind of absor@@ ber@@ ing-@@ like psych@@ ological constru@@ ct .
somehow , i need to find a way to true from now in writing a safe distance between me and my very natural post@@ uring of how the reaction will be to the written .
while i looked for models in the last year for models to do that , i also looked in the past , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see whether they might have better or more sec@@ antly ideas than how we can help creative or more sec@@ ure ideas than we can deal with the emotional risks that are associated with creativity
this qu@@ est led me to the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and the old ro@@ me .
please join me , because the circle will open up again .
but in the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce of gre@@ e@@ ce and ro@@ me , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ v@@ ine di@@ ving spirit , which comes from a dist@@ ant un@@ known source to people -- un@@ know@@ able , un@@ known reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these di@@ vin@@ ous spi@@ ri@@ ts of the creativity of creativity of the creativity of the mon@@ es .
from soc@@ rates , he believed he thought he believed he had an ange@@ p that partici@@ p@@ ated him from further away .
the ro@@ y@@ man had the same idea , called this kind of body inten@@ tional mind , a star@@ c@@ ine geni@@ us of creativity .
that &apos;s great . the ro@@ y@@ man didn &apos;t really think that a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine cre@@ ature that was believed that it was literally living in the walls of an artist -- something like do@@ bby , the home@@ graduate -- that came out and helped the artist in the work literally un@@ ai@@ ded and create the artist in the work literally invisible and to create the result of work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there &apos;s the gap , there &apos;s , there &apos;s the distance i &apos;ve talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that prote@@ cting you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
the artist of the peri@@ ods was prote@@ cted by certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew that you had this physical geni@@ us that helped you .
if your work was fli@@ pping -- not quite your fau@@ lt , right ?
everybody knew your geni@@ us was a little bit there .
that &apos;s how people in the west really thought about creativity for a long
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual on the center of the universe -- about all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures to take the orders of di@@ vin@@ ity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity has completely come from their individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people here or whose artist is calling a geni@@ us -- instead of why he has a geni@@ us .
i have to tell you , i think that was a huge er@@ ror .
you know ? i think there &apos;s a blo@@ cking person that he thinks he or she was like the ves@@ sel , like the she@@ ep and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ known , infin@@ ite myster@@ y is a little bit too much responsibility to mur@@ der them of a fra@@ gr@@ om@@ y of human psychology .
it &apos;s like somebody to please sho@@ ck the sun .
this is de@@ gra@@ ding and re@@ je@@ cting all e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ reach@@ able expec@@ tations to the success .
i think that this happiness risk has wi@@ ped our artists over the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe an el@@ abor@@ ate understanding of the relationship between people and the myster@@ y of the creative .
not , you might .
maybe we can &apos;t just elimin@@ ate that thought of good human@@ ism for 500 years , not just in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would report genu@@ in@@ ely ast@@ on@@ ishing dou@@ bt about the idea of -- basically -- fe@@ es that survey people and fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully on their projects and so forth .
and i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this trip .
but really , the question i &apos;m trying to throw up is : why not ?
why not think about it that way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything that i &apos;ve heard about , when it came about to explain the absolutely crazy mo@@ en@@ di@@ ty of the creative process .
a process that is -- as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody actually be@@ ats -- doesn &apos;t always understand sensi@@ ble .
in fact , it can sometimes feel like a par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
i had a close focus when i met the extraordinary american di@@ ets of ru@@ th stone , who was now over 90 , but who was a full sl@@ ord long , and she told me that when she was growing in the village virg@@ ini@@ a , she told me that when she was growing up in the fields of virg@@ ini@@ a , she said she would feel and hear her can hear how a po@@ em about the landscape
she said it was like a th@@ um@@ bing train out of the air .
they would put it over the land .
she felt when it came , because it would make the earth under her feet to qua@@ ke .
she knew that she could do just one such moment in one such moment , and that was -- in her words -- fli@@ pping like the de@@ vil is happening .
she ran like the de@@ vil to the house while she was tra@@ cked by this po@@ em , and it was only about that she had to get them fast enough to get a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil to get it through le@@ ach@@ ing and putting it on the paper .
she was not fast enough on other pictures . she ran and ran and ran , but she reach@@ ed and ran the house , and the po@@ em roll@@ ed through her , and she conf@@ used it . she said it kept going across country and she said she would keep looking at -- watch out after a different po@@ et .
and then there were these moments -- the part will never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they almost rand@@ om@@ ly rand@@ om@@ ly gave it .
so , you run the house , and you look for the paper , and the po@@ em comes through you , and it just grab@@ s a pen as it goes through you , and then -- -- it was like , it was like , finger with your other hand and getting it to co@@ ok it .
and she pulled the po@@ em on his tail , and then moved it back into their body , and took it on the she@@ et of paper .
and when these of us interested in these opportunities , the po@@ em came in and in@@ t@@ act on paper -- but back@@ wards -- from the last word , first
when i first thought that i was sc@@ aling , that &apos;s rather au@@ rate -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is .
this is not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel !
i &apos;m a mou@@ l@@ maker . to work up to work , i have to stand up at the same time and swe@@ at , and i &apos;m really aw@@ ging through .
but even i &apos;ve st@@ um@@ bled this thing in my bo@@ d@@ pi@@ pool sometimes .
and i sus@@ pe@@ ct a lot of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that came through a source of a source through me that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we end with this in relationship without losing our minds , but in the contr@@ ary of keeping us in a more intellectual health ?
for me , the best part of living , how you can do this , the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ di@@ art . i &apos;ve had to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this issue . and you know what ? most of his life was tom em@@ bo@@ died the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the well-@@ trained modern artist who was trying to control these un@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that lived in him and connect with them .
but then he got older and quie@@ ter , he told me that one day he went on a stable street in los angeles , and that &apos;s when everything changed for him .
he went with a high speed when he &apos;s listening to a small frag@@ ment of the tun@@ e , the way it &apos;s often un@@ tan@@ k@@ able for him , he &apos;s very difficult for him . and he wants to have it . she &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous . but he can &apos;t pre@@ p@@ are it .
it doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe record .
so he starts to acceler@@ ate this old cu@@ bi@@ lage in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and get tra@@ cked from this song on ever@@ right .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not making it . summer guys .
but instead of p@@ ani@@ cked , he just stopped .
he left the whole thought , and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , &quot; spot exc@@ use , can you see that i drive a car ? &quot;
right is it that i just , could i write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a less che@@ aper moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , ma@@ ing@@ le today somebody else .
go and artic@@ ate leon@@ ard co@@ hen . rio .
his whole work of work was changed after that .
not the work itself . it was often as dark as bee@@ h and ever .
but the process and the heavy ad@@ mission that surro@@ unded him was raised when he got the geni@@ us out of it , where he had nothing as a person and left him back where he was , somehow , he realized that it was not had to be a broken , exciting thing .
it could give a hand@@ ful , mira@@ cul@@ ous , bizar@@ re partner , a kind of conversation between tom and the foreign , ex@@ ternal thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard that story , it also changed a little bit the way i was working , and it saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the writing process of news , pra@@ y , love was . i sta@@ yed into one of these cu@@ ts of the second place that we all fell when we &apos;re working on something and it didn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book that has ever been written .
not just bad , but the worst ever of all time .
i started thinking , i should just put the project out .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed tom &apos;s in the fre@@ m of the inner , and i tried .
so i took my look from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt , and i spoke my com@@ ment towards a blan@@ k corner of the space .
i said , &quot; who@@ a , you know , &quot; you and , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not my fau@@ lt , right ?
because you can see that i &apos;m spending all i &apos;m spending . i don &apos;t have any more than that .
so , if you want to have better , you have to cross up here and keep your wealth of the order .
okay . but if you don &apos;t like that ... you know what , then the he@@ ck with it .
i &apos;m still going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you the proto@@ col@@ s that i was today for my part of jobs .
because ... news at the end is how followed . from cent@@ u@@ ries , in the desert north of northern africa , africa gather@@ ed people into the desert of the sac@@ red dan@@ cers and music that were sus@@ pen@@ ded for hours -- to the da@@ wn .
that sc@@ ared were always great , because the dan@@ cers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but every once and again , very rare , something special happened , one of the per@@ form@@ ers actually became over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ al .
and i know that you know what i &apos;m talking about , because i know you all saw one of your life in your life .
it was like time was standing sil@@ ence , and the dan@@ cers went through a kind of p@@ for@@ te , he did nothing different than he &apos;d ever done before -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything jo@@ ined together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t appear ab@@ human@@ able even longer .
it was clo@@ sely open from inside , and it star@@ t@@ led from the bottom , and everything kno@@ cked through a di@@ v@@ ine fire .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it with his name .
they put the hands together and they started sing@@ ing : alex@@ al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . see .
this is god , you know ?
interesting histor@@ ic foot@@ note : when the mo@@ unt sou@@ sp@@ in rele@@ ases , they brought this use . the inci@@ dence changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries of lam@@ al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h piano to broad@@ ol@@ ene , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , that you can still fight in cra@@ cks and fl@@ ame dan@@ cers .
if a character in spa@@ in in spa@@ in , bas@@ al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , is something universal : rock al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , al@@ la@@ h , great , patter@@ vo star is un@@ visible , there &apos;s a more el@@ abor@@ ate look of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the tri@@ cky part follo@@ ws the next morning when the dan@@ cer wa@@ kes himself and recogni@@ zes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;@@ clock on a tu@@ es@@ day -- and he no longer car@@ ries a five-@@ round of god .
it &apos;s just an aging cur@@ ent with pain@@ t@@ ling k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe it will never go back to that al@@ em .
and maybe nobody will never call god &apos;s name when he turns down , but what does he then want to start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ ds of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite as full if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your existence would have that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your existence .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a pole -- from an incredible source of an incredible source of your life that &apos;s distribu@@ ted to someone else , when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about this as this , all of this changes .
and so i started thinking , and i think with the last months , while i was working on the book that followed soon -- when the dangerous , sc@@ ary , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , well-@@ determin@@ ed success@@ ors of my previous success .
what i have to say constantly , when i &apos;m going to be crazy about it , is not fear .
it &apos;s not dis@@ coura@@ ged .
you just do your job .
must be contribu@@ ted for your contribu@@ tion , whatever it wants to be .
if your job is dan@@ cing , tan@@ ch .
if the du@@ m@@ b geni@@ us that formed you , you decide , for a moment , to show a hur@@ se of wonder through your effort , then the proje@@ tz@@ é !
and if it &apos;s , dan@@ ch still dance your dance .
and saturn ol@@ p@@ é ! look for it against all of that .
i believe in it , and i feel that we should teach .
bas@@ ol@@ é ! right for all you , despite all of that , just for you , simply that you have the m@@ ere human love and the mind to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
ol@@ é !
last year , i showed these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s , which , for roughly three million years , had the size of the bottom 4@@ 8 states , s@@ hr@@ in@@ k 40 percent .
but it doesn &apos;t write very hard enough the serious problem of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thi@@ ck@@ le of ice .
in a certain sense , the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s is the be@@ ating heart of our global climate system .
it gro@@ ws in the winter , and s@@ hr@@ in@@ ks in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se thing that has happened in the last 25 years .
the perman@@ ent ice is mar@@ ched with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue . this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it &apos;s s@@ hr@@ in@@ king in the summer .
what &apos;s called the perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood that flo@@ ws out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to here .
this is a problem , because prote@@ cting the fro@@ zen cause to the arc@@ tic ocean to where there is large quanti@@ ties of fro@@ zen carbon , which , when it turns up , is trans@@ fer@@ red to the micro@@ bes of me@@ than@@ e .
compared to the full amount of climate trans@@ it in the atmosphere , this is going to double dou@@ bling if we tran@@ sc@@ end this critical point .
today , today in some flat la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e from itself , they sl@@ um@@ p from the water .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ters at university in al@@ as@@ ka is travel@@ ing with another group of work in the other flat la@@ ke of the last winter .
who@@ a !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will we do it .
and one reason is , this vast heat of heat is foreig@@ ning green@@ land from the north .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al re@@ water river .
but the volu@@ me are much larger than ever before .
this is the ri@@ st@@ l@@ us@@ i river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know what the sea level is through land ice mel@@ ts here , it &apos;s cir@@ bling into the sea .
these ri@@ vers are easy to take these ri@@ vers .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ic@@ e@@ al mass on the planet .
last month , researchers repor@@ ted that the entire continent is now a negative ice foot@@ print .
and the west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which is up on a few under@@ water is@@ lands , is particularly strong in mel@@ ting .
this is equivalent to 20 feet of sea , which is like green@@ land .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the thir@@ d-@@ largest ic@@ e@@ fish mass , you see on the top of new la@@ kes that were gl@@ aci@@ er a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ k@@ water from this mel@@ ting water .
in the front , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the fresh water source for this city .
the water pil@@ es have been zo@@ o@@ zing .
but when you inclu@@ de , the most of drin@@ king water will fall away .
in california , a 4@@ 0-@@ percent redu@@ ction of the s@@ no@@ w li@@ gam@@ s of the si@@ er@@ ra .
this is because of the memory bas@@ ks .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read them , are serious .
these ex@@ ec@@ ting in the world creates a dra@@ matic increase of fir@@ ing to fir@@ e .
and the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es all over the world have never resul@@ ted in a really extraordinary and earlier inci@@ dent before in the world .
four times so many in the last 30 years are still expected to the previous 75 years .
this is a completely un@@ hal@@ vable develop@@ mental pattern .
if you look at this in the histor@@ ical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve made 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day into the oceans .
look at the do@@ main of the eastern pacific , right , from the american continent of west and both the axis of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a dra@@ matic dec@@ line of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single dig@@ it for global warming , against de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which makes 20 percent , is burning fossil fu@@ els .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest thing as well .
the united states is one of the two largest pollu@@ t@@ ters combin@@ ed with china .
and the sugge@@ sti@@ on was to build a lot of other coal fac@@ tor@@ ies .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that were recor@@ ded in the last few years with some of the green alterna@@ tives that have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
i think that &apos;s a political debate in our country .
and the co@@ hl@@ ines and o@@ b@@ dies have spent a quar@@ ter billion dollars last satur@@ a year to rate clean coal , which is already a con@@ tradi@@ ction in it .
so , that image remin@@ ded me of something .
when christ@@ mas came around me , at home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion tons of co@@ tat@@ o@@ es .
you didn &apos;t seem to see it in the news .
this is the second largest drop of ab@@ sen@@ ce of america in our entire country
this was what happened about christ@@ mas .
one of the ko@@ hl@@ on@@ os of the co@@ hl@@ ine industry was this one .
ho@@ dy the fossi@@ man is a deli@@ ght@@ ful , happy boy .
it &apos;s got it in bo@@ il and poverty in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
fro@@ sty , the carbon man will every day cle@@ an@@ er .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and pa@@ i@@ th@@ ful , and fe@@ e@@ sta@@ sty wor@@ ries in fo@@ ster and bread .
this is the source of most of the coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the most powerful mile wor@@ ker is the la@@ d@@ der of mas@@ sey desert .
let me tell you a very clear word : al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry ri@@ d , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has called two campaig@@ ns in life .
this is one , a part of it .
at co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we see climate change as a serious dan@@ ger for our business .
so we set it to the top line , spending a si@@ ous money money to bring a lesson on the way to bring the truth about coal .
the fact is that coal is not fr@@ au@@ d .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and we &apos;re also sm@@ elling well .
so do you don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s stay that quie@@ t .
sau@@ dy coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean co@@ al-@@ kill factory .
fantastic ! this machine is quite sh@@ l@@ oud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean co@@ al-@@ case technology .
and yet , burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remark@@ ably clean co@@ al-@@ led technology , which you see here , changes everything .
and just look at it , this is the clean , clean co@@ al-@@ technology technology .
finally , the positive alternative of our economic challenge and our challenge of national security and our challenge .
the america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thre@@ ad that conne@@ cts all of these , is our depen@@ dence on carbon dio@@ xide fu@@ els like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
but now , there is a coura@@ ge@@ ous , new solution to get us out of this stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward situation .
fe@@ eding america with 100 percent clean electricity over the next 10 years over the next
a plan to get america back to work , to make us sa@@ fer and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
wor@@ gue america . find more out .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a new govern@@ ance of america .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways of re@@ duc@@ ing our depen@@ dence of old , dir@@ ty fu@@ els that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es our world .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new invest@@ ments to create well-@@ paying jobs .
wor@@ gue america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , you go alone .
if you want to come far , you go together . &quot;
we need to come far , and we need to get very fast .
thank you very much .
i &apos;d like to start asking you to think back to the time of your childhood when they play with com@@ modi@@ ties .
while they realized how to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate and contra@@ ct their hands , the blocks are absor@@ bing and moving , they actually started to think about and understand problems and solve things by understanding and change struc@@ tural link .
the spa@@ tial thinking is so connected to how we understand a vast lot of our surro@@ und@@ ings .
as a neuro@@ scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my metho@@ ds pat@@ ti and my collea@@ gue je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i started mar@@ vel : what if we use computers , rather than a mouse ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment , which moves like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p on a flat track surface ... what if we could interven@@ e with both hands and we take data and we could artic@@ u@@ late them , how we want it ?
that question was so inten@@ ting that we &apos;ve decided to study the answer and to develop si@@ st@@ ure .
in short , an el@@ vable one is an inter@@ active computer in the size of a small coo@@ k@@ ie .
they can move with the hand , they can sense each other , they can dete@@ ct their mov@@ ements , and you have a screen and a spor@@ ting sor@@ cher .
more importantly , are physi@@ cal , so you can only pick them up like building fur@@ ders just by fre@@ ing out your hands and move it into it .
and the si@@ st@@ les are an example of a new generation of aid to the manipu@@ lation of digital data .
and when these devices become more physical and develop a conscious awareness for their mov@@ ements , recogni@@ zing each other and feeling the ene@@ my of our circum@@ stance with them , then we can start to study new and more entertain@@ ing species .
i start with a couple of simple examples .
this si@@ st@@ ness is con@@ tra@@ cted for the video re@@ mission , and when i wra@@ p it in a direction , the video will play forward , and if i p@@ p it to the other direction , it &apos;s bac@@ ks back@@ wards .
and that inter@@ active portra@@ its are true to each other .
so when i leave them si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side , that &apos;s what it &apos;s interested in .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded in the opposite , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can become something nervous .
and they feel their mov@@ ements as well and in@@ sti@@ pa@@ tion .
one interesting result of the inter@@ actions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gest@@ ures , like scre@@ aming of colors like this , how to sha@@ ke this with the flu@@ ids .
in this case , we &apos;ve con@@ activ@@ ated three run@@ ls as a color po@@ ts , and i can use them to po@@ ur paint in the middle , where they &apos;re mix@@ ed .
if we over@@ go it , we can send a little back back a little bit .
there are also some nice ways in education like languages , mathematical or lo@@ gic play , where we give people the opportunity to give them the opportunity to do the od@@ d reci@@ pi@@ ent and to see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series , which i &apos;m creating with a simple scale program .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ ger .
basically , every round of every round on every hig@@ il@@ er happens happens , and as you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re being re@@ sted over a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it mix@@ es again , and you have a new letter combin@@ ation and new possibilities .
thank you very much .
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i was able to get them to try it out , and taken a video of it .
they were really loved it .
one of the interesting circum@@ stances about these kinds of appli@@ cations is you don &apos;t have to give people lots of in@@ struc@@ tions .
all you have to say is &quot; manufac@@ ture words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
so here are a couple of people who test it .
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest zi@@ ster at the bottom right there .
and it turned out he wanted to just st@@ ack the si@@ sters .
so for him , they were just hard@@ ware .
this is an inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ filter filter .
we wanted to develop a learning tool for language sch@@ ers .
this is fe@@ li@@ x .
he can bring new characters into the scene by looking at the el@@ der@@ ness from the table that shows this character .
here , he gives up the sun .
the sun is ris@@ ing on .
now , he &apos;ll put a tra@@ ctor in the scene .
the or@@ an@@ der tra@@ ctor .
good work ! yes .
by sha@@ king the el@@ ev@@ e and putting it si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side , he can interact the characters ...
... inv@@ ent to his own story .
hell@@ o !
it &apos;s a story with the open end , and he can decide how it &apos;s evol@@ ving .
flying c@@ at .
the last example that i have today to show you is a musi@@ cian of live calls that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the hei@@ ght as a sound , like leadership , like leadership , and &quot; w@@ ass and ta@@ kes . &quot;
every has four different vari@@ ations ; you can pick up which one wants to use .
and you can feed this sound into the sequence that you can establi@@ sh into any patterns .
and you store it by simply holding a ton@@ gue si@@ te to a sequence of a sequence .
there are effects that can alter live , such as hei@@ ght and fil@@ ters .
you put it with a particular t@@ one , and then it starts to put it to hi@@ de .
and then also re-@@ assem@@ bly effects like speed and volu@@ it that apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s take a look .
we start by trying to feed leadership in two sequen@@ cing more broad@@ ly and organi@@ zing them in a row , exp@@ and them and put a little more of the voice a little more .
now i &apos;m going to put a b@@ ass .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit more of it .
and i &apos;m now provi@@ ding the filter with the w@@ inning so i can control the effect of life .
i can speed up all the sequence by stam@@ p the p@@ ace into one or the other direction .
and now i &apos;m going to su@@ ck the fil@@ ter with a little bit more .
i can change the sequence while it &apos;s moving down .
and by that , i don &apos;t have to plan them in the front , but can impro@@ v@@ ise , throughout the end of it , or give them s@@ hr@@ in@@ ked .
and finally , i can make the whole sequence out by watching the lou@@ d@@ less ver@@ ker to the left .
thank you very much .
so as you can see , my exc@@ it@@ ement is to develop new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that better to fit like how our brains and bodies work .
and today , i &apos;ve had time to show you some of this new design world and some of the ways that we tell what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with is that , on the th@@ res@@ hold , we &apos;re at the th@@ res@@ hold to interaction with digital media with digital media , to bring information to our world that mat@@ ches our dem@@ ands .
so thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all conver@@ sa@@ tions with all of you
yeah , good after@@ noon .
i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what &apos;s going to be bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ les ?
i have to pick up a little bit , and that &apos;s how bio@@ ha@@ cking with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been working with the bio@@ ha@@ cking a few years ago , and i &apos;ve started , because i just wanted to know more and it didn &apos;t want to do it in the first place , what i &apos;ve learned in the study .
so , this was my primary motiv@@ ation .
so it was a curi@@ osity , and i wanted to sort of get closer on the matter , like that .
now , i think that molecular biology is generally talking , generally speaking , biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything you count to do syn@@ thetic biology and so on .
cru@@ cially important , now is extremely important , and much , much more important will be in the future .
there are so contro@@ versi@@ al things like these whole gene@@ tically engine@@ ered plants on the out@@ brea@@ ks .
there &apos;s now cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the united states , who are trying to make bio@@ ways , so gas from al@@ ga@@ e .
among then , there are things that are very in the everyday run , which most people but not even are , for instance , was@@ hing enzy@@ mes that allow us to was@@ h with 4@@ 0-@@ degree ver@@ gi@@ an , is also gene@@ tically optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes .
and the list is able to continue end@@ less@@ ly .
and so for an interest in this technology , i kept on there on the back .
so why does things ha@@ ck ?
most people know that out of the software level .
computers ha@@ cking , and then in the media it &apos;s always like , yes , the ha@@ ck@@ ers break in somewhere and cla@@ ws data and so on .
and so , that &apos;s very sad for ha@@ ck@@ fly &apos;s , because that &apos;s not what it actually started to do and what it really is that and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that is , the software ha@@ cker , in the 197@@ 0s , started with computer machines , and it &apos;s also been created the internet .
and it &apos;s about working with a gam@@ ful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and so , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a socie@@ tal problem , it can just be a future problem , which is like simpli@@ fying things , so a random problem to throw a question , and how to make that different , or how to do it better .
and it &apos;s been because it &apos;s become lar@@ gi@@ zed with software , but there &apos;s also a whole board in electr@@ on@@ ics , there &apos;s also a whole board scene that bub@@ bles electr@@ on@@ ics circu@@ it all kinds of things
and now , also , also , i want to take this metaphor that comes from syn@@ thetic biology , taking biology from syn@@ thetic biology , because , the ah@@ n@@ .@@ a code is a abstra@@ ct code , which is that it &apos;s not equal as computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , it &apos;s not equal as computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , so it &apos;s real matter , and not just cy@@ ber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code , and you can make it ha@@ cking , so you can do it , so i find that incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper on it .
this actually really launched two-@@ thousand eight in the form , these these networks .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ ter@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe and co@@ operation in india built the network , but has members of people or active people all over the world .
this is a more arti@@ stic ex@@ ecu@@ tion , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosop@@ her@@ s and working with scientists with scientists to express and ask with these technologies and to ask and to do that creative , and there are museum vision issues and defini@@ te , all sorts of things .
but actually , it &apos;s always about finding such a more pleas@@ ure access , so you have a play@@ ful relationship with it .
and then there is do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ en@@ anim@@ ent bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g , which is i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o .
this is a network from the united states , that &apos;s actually more kind of for@@ um where you &apos;re about to hang and disc@@ uss online .
they &apos;re a little bit of technical , and also a little bit of business on the way , and they &apos;re also being asked , including , yeah , questions .
and based on these networks that the entire popular has done , it depen@@ ds to be a scene that i want to just portra@@ .
so in the image at the top at the top you see bio@@ star , which is a ha@@ ck@@ space , which is basically a kind of school , so a private school , non@@ profit facili@@ ties , where everybody can come .
kids , old , all sorts of people go there to just zi@@ ct with it , they put a lab , and look at what you can do if these lab proto@@ col@@ on@@ es .
on the left left is a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , hou@@ se@@ hold ct fi@@ ges is the ones that , but there &apos;s quite a long time .
there &apos;s been more than these other two networks .
and they also work in such an arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct of biological materials and , yes , electr@@ on@@ ics buil@@ ders , and combin@@ ing that in a fairly cas@@ ish way .
a group from app@@ ar@@ a that i met a long time ago , who was a student group that would like to communicate the public , what they learned in college , and they made it so much on top of street actions , and they try to explain to people what was , what is magne@@ n@@ .@@ a .
and i have a lec@@ ture in the other image , in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in the medical museum , combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion on the theme .
and that &apos;s typically a bunch of young people , but the only thing that &apos;s actually in common is this fascin@@ ation in the technology is this fascin@@ ation in the technology .
and what you can do with it and also ask for society , so , okay , what do you know what would you want to participa@@ te to , have an interest in you to bring care of it like this ?
so , ok , so to ha@@ cking biology , you kind of need material .
you need biological materials , and you need tools , and this is a lab , and this is a lab .
or instead of what you typically know in a lab , which are sort of d@@ loo@@ ded machines , extremely expensive , extremely di@@ versi@@ ous , only for professional , trained acade@@ mic , with ph@@ .@@ d , and so on .
and our approach was stop saying , okay , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
this isn &apos;t actually necessary because every single phone machine every single time has actually higher technologies than most lab@@ lab , it &apos;s like that .
and s o with this pre@@ mis@@ e , for example , brian de@@ g@@ ger in britain , trying to assem@@ ble a mini@@ mal ab@@ yl@@ or , then took a ste@@ am@@ y ta@@ pe , a hot pla@@ te of light , a he@@ ath pla@@ te and , yes , so hea@@ ven s@@ woo@@ ping , and then it &apos;s growing bacteria .
so anybody , who &apos;s been sent a sou@@ p once , that he has left too long even before .
i tried this in my lab , working home a little bit , and then i &apos;d stop so like , i bought such a direct hand@@ -@@ prin@@ ting e@@ bay , and i made a little bit of d.@@ n@@ .@@ a analysis , trying to take a gu@@ usi@@ ni@@ zing , so something like that / d.@@ n@@ .@@ mom pressure prin@@ ting to take me back home .
i don &apos;t want that to be a jo@@ ke now , but .
so at the bottom here in this picture , you see is the lab , in leadership , so that &apos;s so kind of a strong garage that has university , a group in paris , that has university in paris , a group in paris that has happened , and doing pretty interesting things , and does fairly interesting things , i want to cut a project for a little bit of a second .
and this is bio@@ star , which is just mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , this is , kind of , a kind of a d@@ ess school for molecular biology .
and yeah , you can see , it &apos;s relatively straight , it &apos;s relatively he@@ ter@@ o@@ ar , so that &apos;s there by people doing it alone , so far to large organizations that pre@@ tend that they do more form@@ alized in institu@@ tional form .
but always , the approach is that it st@@ ops just and it should be acc@@ essi@@ ble .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , o@@ .@@ k , is there as real right now , and we are online , and we &apos;re online , and we know so like the people who always make ch@@ at@@ ting and stuff .
and then came from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o or@@ g or@@ g , and i said , we have to make really real , real hit , and then we organized two events , one in london , and then organized two instal@@ lations , one in london , a two-@@ thousand 10 , and a shor@@ tly back in san francisco .
and , then , again , it went , and it &apos;s we , what do we want , what do we want to share , what do we want to communicate ?
and what are our values , and what are our things , our foundation ?
and so there we &apos;ve done a co@@ st-@@ func@@ ct serious ct .
it was quite intui@@ tive , so everybody just has the wi@@ sh@@ es , his and what it st@@ ops , makes it , then it does .
there , in my view , was a very good code .
and we didn &apos;t make that connection , but that &apos;s , i think , well , i think , pretty well , people are pretty expected about this .
and we actually try to re@@ move that into the acade@@ mic world , but there &apos;s kind of not going to be there .
and so i think , we &apos;re seeing a step further of bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ rop@@ es , like even one step further than the acade@@ mic world .
right , so what technology do we actually do now ?
a project that i made with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted a so-@@ called op@@ tical tra@@ p or op@@ tical p@@ ar or op@@ tical p@@ wee@@ ts .
this is , if you focus a las@@ er be@@ am , on one in the room , you can put it into the air or in the liquid , and then you move in that focus , so it &apos;s absor@@ bed there , so it &apos;s absor@@ bed , so like a tra@@ c@@ tor@@ ian be@@ am in principle .
so this really works , this is what it &apos;s done in the acade@@ mic prototyp@@ e , and we thought , okay , we might get on that , then took a web@@ c@@ am that squ@@ ee@@ zes up , put the l@@ ens , fli@@ pping the l@@ ens , you have a microscop@@ e that hei@@ gh@@ tens about four hundred times .
you see that down down there .
and then we went out a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d stran@@ ner , and kno@@ cked the po@@ ckets up the las@@ er , and then try to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it anyway .
so another project that &apos;s out of the french group out of paris , which has happened , that &apos;s pretty cool .
so , that &apos;s what he had like a brain wave device , so e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g or something like this , so he &apos;s run with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
so he ble@@ w this one into this hel@@ met , and in co@@ operation with the museum that went on .
so then the vis@@ it@@ ors went in into the room , put on this chair , put it in this hel@@ met .
then your brain waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding after what they thought , and how they thought , well , they were approach@@ ed different lights in the room .
it was a pretty terri@@ fic project .
another thing from the united states that &apos;s already got to do this ad@@ oles@@ cent story is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , which is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r answer , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about repli@@ c@@ ating gene , repli@@ c@@ ating i@@ .@@ a , to repli@@ cate frag@@ ments so you can see it .
so when i do this that the pro@@ fil@@ es of the crime place , then go down , colle@@ cting some ha@@ ens there , and then they do this techni@@ que , and then they can do this techni@@ que , and then you can say , okay , this hair &apos;s speaking to this people , like that .
and the machines doing this , they &apos;re quite expensive to buy commercial , the che@@ ap@@ est walk is so expensive to get at four thousand euro@@ s .
and that &apos;s not in the ho@@ b@@ by@@ space , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do very much .
so that &apos;s just one app@@ lic@@ ation of many that you can do with this .
and they have created so two two buil@@ ders , and they said , o@@ .@@ .@@ k , we do it easier and che@@ aper , and we have just made open-@@ source , so free hard@@ ware , electr@@ on@@ ics , putting this one tool together , and are now the most cheap provi@@ ders of these devices now , and are now the most che@@ ap@@ est supply of these devices around the world
i think that &apos;s kind of six dollars or something like that .
but , anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s certainly in a frame@@ work where it becomes very offen@@ sive .
so , i think , to me , it &apos;s a very ha@@ un@@ ti@@ le ha@@ ck .
a project that i recently started to do was to build a gene company .
genom@@ ic store is , you know , sort of like a sac@@ ching gun that sna@@ ps about that far , two centi@@ meters or something .
you put in mu@@ n@@ .@@ a gold@@ particles on gold particles , and the gold@@ mers then got into these air cap@@ s , and then i shot them on the edge , and then they made it like this .
so the device that you see that it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is what my prototyp@@ e , though , that didn &apos;t look like a third , the thing on this thing , the thing on it , open electr@@ on@@ ics on it and pressure , and that was too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a je@@ t pen@@ up@@ ture and put it on this .
a hol@@ thou@@ se , if you electri@@ ze the full power with water , it has enough pressure , so i think , so 40 to six times a times .
and so you can then speed up the particles strong enough , and then they go in the oni@@ on as well .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euro@@ s up , or something like that , sa@@ ping around 50 .
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially const@@ it@@ able .
so this is also right now that the core will of the scene is to increase this avail@@ ability of technology , and also increase the information and the understanding that more people can engage .
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have quite little idea of it , and also no opportunity to make it really well .
because , if you &apos;re just reading about it , from a classroom liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve seen it yourself or seen it yourself .
and i think technology is always going to be important in our modern societies .
and if you can also meet useful citi@@ zen in the society , and you want to talk and talk , you need the access to knowledge and technology , you need the access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it , and understand it , to understand and understand it .
and that makes it under the stre@@ e@@ ks open , open science and citi@@ zen science .
so that you &apos;ve got to be able to be able to tell yourself , as a citizens , to share these kinds of scientific technologies .
and that is the core concern@@ s of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
these are the people that at least offi@@ cially inspired offi@@ cially on the website , i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ -@@ city ne@@ g website .
that &apos;s already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting also is that they &apos;re also repres@@ ented in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
i think that &apos;s there , they are less people in there than actually exi@@ sting .
so i know of some that didn &apos;t absor@@ p@@ ted .
and these are just now the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , the individual people .
so , in part , with these ha@@ cking spaces , these places have been put together there .
and in the beginning , that &apos;s really true .
and as i said , two times it &apos;s only beginning .
and ha@@ cking , so the computer ha@@ ck@@ al@@ ity , because the c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , nin@@ e-@@ 100 hundred .
and this now has become a gigan@@ tic network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that are repres@@ ented all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to end up in a similar way , and then we &apos;re also getting better finan@@ ced , so that there is more to be involved in people
and i would invi@@ te everybody to accept with it and also try to figure out what was going on .
it &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curi@@ osity , and enough energy in it , you &apos;ll get far there .
thank you very much for listening .
so that &apos;s it .
yeah , hell@@ o .
so how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that i think very stron@@ g@@ ly as a designer , but also in the area of the research of the research , and especially all of all things in the user .
it &apos;s about how you approach people in inter@@ active media , so that they can use these inter@@ active media , and so they create an almost satis@@ fying experience .
i believe that the inter@@ active media in our ar@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models address , so paradig@@ ot@@ y-@@ progra@@ mm@@ ed appe@@ ar@@ ance that has been progra@@ mm@@ ed in our biological memory very , very long ago , and that we can re@@ cover that through inter@@ active media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this high-@@ technology technology that you &apos;re beginning to get you to the future , but in fact , the future is right to us , but it &apos;s that the future is right to us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic
so what are evolution actually arch@@ a@@ ic models ?
i &apos;ve written four songs &apos; words , and i want to explain to you brie@@ fly .
arch@@ a@@ ic cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve en@@ counter@@ ed in the pre-@@ industrial times .
so , in this arch@@ a@@ ic models , we &apos;ve heard that we have a gene relation to virtu@@ ality .
that sounds like this is un@@ belie@@ vable , in principle .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that same thing , and i &apos;m going to prove you by attemp@@ ting that you have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
the second aspe@@ ct is that since these arch@@ a@@ gi@@ cally important devices , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very difficult about this arch@@ a@@ ic model , though we now use a co@@ di@@ fied language today .
and the third sphere , which is actually expla@@ ining by itself .
we all know that the inter@@ active media by definition are non-@@ lin@@ ear , which invol@@ ves the san@@ ity of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and what , of course , says that we today feel lin@@ ear@@ ity as normal normal .
the fourth thing is that for us , the story is a place of information on us .
now , how does this with virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove you to prove that .
how many do@@ ors do the house in which you live ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them spon@@ tane@@ ously , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go in the spirit through this house , in whom they live , and look at how many do@@ ors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it &apos;s virtual reality , it &apos;s sol@@ ely non-@@ computers .
fantastic , right ?
and so here we are giving ourselves law@@ ns at the medi@@ i cam@@ pus , so we show the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ .@@ lab , we can actually do that all the time .
and this pos@@ ness to virtual the virtual reality , which they &apos;ve had the people in the pre-@@ industrial times also , because they have nothing what@@ so@@ ever .
these didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo@@ oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
they didn &apos;t have a mass media .
the only thing that they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory was coming down .
in his head , knowledge was called , and with this virtual ima@@ gery , the imagination , had been continu@@ ed to know also .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so powerful in us that we can circum@@ vent power so well .
and the interesting thing about this is , if i can , you can take a little trip .
yeah . all right .
and what &apos;s interesting about it is that at the time , the human produ@@ cers and medium was itself .
now , if you think about a piece of time .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has made a change .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a minute .
so , critical tools of information process@@ ing have been since all the stories .
sh@@ ame , pri@@ rie@@ sts , p@@ rie@@ sts , called knowle@@ d@@ ges , were em@@ ted to for knowledge in stories .
and even today , we &apos;re han@@ ging very , very strong about stories .
the auth@@ or of the book the ast@@ on@@ le , jon@@ a@@ than lu@@ nie@@ de , we still associ@@ ate a thou@@ sand@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories every day .
that means for a child who has spent it until achie@@ ving the 20@@ -year-old &apos;s reci@@ pes , most of his life has spent most of his life with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories .
now , our love for stories is that we have a child on the la@@ p as a child on the la@@ ke of our
no , no , far lost .
it goes back much further into the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial times .
but to me , in the area of the inter@@ active media as incredibly impres@@ sive , we &apos;ve equi@@ ved pieces in our biological memory , the ability to think non-@@ lin@@ lin@@ ary .
i brought you an example of the north american tri@@ be in no@@ ot@@ ka@@ -@@ na@@ tive indian .
and the lives lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
and as you can see , this is a very insu@@ lt area , and you had to navi@@ gate somehow , you could come from island to island to get food .
and they did it with what we call the office cards .
you may also know that , if you &apos;re interested in it , from the austr@@ ali@@ an jud@@ ants .
and they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have le@@ dge lan@@ es , but they use these kinds of genes of sun@@ gl@@ ines , or also ob@@ stac@@ les .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navi@@ gation and to@@ po@@ graph@@ y could be broken by regi@@ ons of regi@@ ons .
where the language was under@@ organized the language of pris@@ on@@ ing .
so that means you &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating sound about sound and rhyth@@ m .
and these sound and this rhyth@@ m have the ge@@ ology to repres@@ ented the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region , and that also allowed that you could de@@ com@@ press these songs and put together different , and so to go left , and also go back to the place and also to move back to the
why don &apos;t we pause to get from the top of a to b ?
anyway , so not to navi@@ gate .
so what turns out there ?
it &apos;s seen this speci@@ um of machine age .
we started running in the so-@@ called the mo@@ od age .
it happened the machine age , and it happens to be the book , and it happens above that is the phot@@ oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
and this is exactly what happens that we &apos;ve shif@@ ted the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and that has re@@ duced their production of our individual memor@@ ies on ex@@ ternal media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , god , we , we , you know , have a bit of a virtual thing to do
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become stran@@ ser for us , and has reality with nothing more .
bru@@ ce brown , a well-@@ known design resear@@ cher at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , is so far away to say that this mass media , he means the book and the image , so not the television , the internet and so on , what we &apos;re saying as a mass media today , that these milli@@ media diver@@ ts of our memor@@ ies , and have our ability to virtu@@ alize with virtu@@ alism .
let &apos;s make a little inter@@ nap@@ ar .
from the mo@@ t age to the machine age .
what has our thinking on our thinking and on our memory ?
and then the inter@@ fer@@ red forces are the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to have more and more over@@ written over the cent@@ u@@ ries by the descri@@ p@@ tions of the machine age .
that means instead of remem@@ ber@@ ing us individu@@ ally , we &apos;ve used standar@@ di@@ zed , wid@@ ely used in rich@@ -@@ common patterns of memor@@ ies that we can hang our personal memor@@ ies .
we no longer do it yourself .
we have an abstra@@ ct of an abstra@@ c@@ ated language .
we don &apos;t travel on images anymore in images that don &apos;t last things in images , but we co@@ di@@ fy you our language .
we used to think that things happen lin@@ ear .
and we accep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as the law , and there are just ex@@ cep@@ tions as , for example , the non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
what we &apos;ve rema@@ ined is the one that rema@@ ins .
yet , we &apos;re still ar@@ re@@ sted the audi@@ o as information process@@ ing very , very strong .
the question is , what is now next ?
we had the bird age , we had the machine age , and we now say that &apos;s what cyber@@ age called &quot; cyber@@
this sounds very spac@@ y , and it sounds very up@@ set to sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction , i know .
but these concep@@ ts of cyber@@ age , which helps us discover these possibilities again again our ability to discover our ability .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about the non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about zero sight .
i want to explain a little bit right now .
there are technical concep@@ ts such as aug@@ mented reality , which means the aug@@ mented reality .
so if you look at google glas@@ ses , for instance , this is a concept that lets us re@@ combin@@ ing the virtual world with the real world , that means our aff@@ in@@ ity to virtual , means our aff@@ in@@ ity , the virtual than something normal than natural , is suggest@@ ed again .
another example is that this is called virtual reality .
of course , as crazy as i can hear , we may sound physi@@ cally in the context of my speech , and we &apos;re moving on physi@@ cally in non-@@ exi@@ sting , virtual worl@@ ds , right after the h@@ olo@@ de@@ cks .
and other examples of are the anti@@ ci@@ ents , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a person &apos;s notice .
all of this takes the ability to accept our core ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habit@@ at .
i &apos;ve been working in graduate , and i hope to work the video , a very , very beautiful project , this is the b@@ ach@@ el@@ i work of michael bur@@ k , an@@ it@@ ka@@ thr@@ in cr@@ ence , j@@ or@@ is sear@@ iel and jan@@ -@@ mur@@ ce g@@ arb@@ er .
and the two previous ones are also here today .
maybe you can step up for a minute , so you can pause with the two things about the project .
and this project , i brought , as an example , to be add@@ res@@ sed up on this arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models .
so , the whole thing is a game , i have to say that .
which , of course , what the key page is extremely extreme , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;ll have very likely to taste people in front of some con@@ it , or that they play with with the con@@ so@@ le in the hand with some con@@ so@@ le in the hand .
by all , you &apos;re doing that in yourself .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s true that i &apos;m explor@@ ing the outside world , so i decided to re@@ discover the real world .
and this game is conne@@ cting the virtual world , so the data is the data space that we produce , with the real world .
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i have to dist@@ ingu@@ ish so much .
so you can probably explain a lot better than that , there &apos;s more much on it .
and it &apos;s about a city i explor@@ ed a city by looking at which places were positive or a negative .
and so i get to a completely different view of the city , a very different impres@@ sion , which is that i see deep and positive z@@ ones of a city , and it &apos;s so kind of a different virtual map from a very real city of a very real city .
and we can now like to watch that .
ah , you can see , sorry , is another explan@@ ation of what you &apos;re seeing here .
of course , this virtual world disappe@@ ars in the walls of our cities , so it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of a bol@@ d@@ light , we can see these virtual worl@@ ds .
so , i &apos;d like to wra@@ p that to wra@@ p up my talk and in the sense that the characteri@@ stics and abilities that we &apos;ve ac@@ qui@@ red from the bird age , and which has gone through us so much in the machine age , that it can be activ@@ ated with the so-@@ called cy@@ ber aging , and that we can actually think about complex , technologi@@ cal , new products , actually not in the future , but actually to us back to our roots .
thank you very much .
yeah , i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to be with you .
i &apos;m just asked if this s@@ ack is a man s@@ ack , and i &apos;m going to talk to you .
that &apos;s not going to do .
i &apos;m going to resol@@ ve at the same time what &apos;s in there .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , i &apos;m going to do it a little bit curious .
yes , children are fam@@ ously , or should be curious , designers as well .
i &apos;m a place from house , so , of course , i &apos;m concerned also with the theme of curi@@ osity , and how is changing our curi@@ osity again , and why we might lose curi@@ osity , and we need to re-@@ pro@@ mp@@ t it , and and so on and so on .
that &apos;s a lot of things that you &apos;re talking about next to the actual purpose as a com@@ modi@@ ty .
if profess@@ ors are curious , they &apos;re often thro@@ wn down in such an e-@@ research se@@ mi@@ ster .
and that &apos;s also what i &apos;ve had in the last half year .
this is a research se@@ wer about natural user interface .
now , they &apos;re going to ask questions , why are all the designers start with such natural , arch@@ a@@ ic jud@@ g@@ ments of communication , inter@@ acting , etc and so on .
and since i &apos;m just one of these little devices , because things are ever going to be more intui@@ tive , always more natural , more autonom@@ ous , and you have to look at it , which is actually for human beings , what &apos;s us@@ itely friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
and in front of the background , i have the natural user interface , so the next generation in the audience , so the next generation in which they &apos;re coun@@ ting in the relationship of the human computer with how our tools , or how the computer comes from the computer cen@@ sor@@ s to the digital assi@@ stant .
so i &apos;ve been successful with this , when is , of course or intui@@ tive .
maybe again , you might have a look at it .
so why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s a moment here , then we &apos;re moving from the third to fourth corpo@@ rate generation or corpo@@ rate form .
so from the modern company into the computer society .
every society is em@@ bed@@ ded by a primary medium .
at the beginning , the tri@@ b@@ al society was in language .
that means that you found that you &apos;ve been talking a common language , you could communicate with each other , you &apos;ve turned into the same ca@@ ve , or you enter other areas , cities have educ@@ ated or villa@@ ges , like this , &quot; tri@@ b@@ al society is kind of created . &quot;
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very vi@@ wes@@ ome .
now you had to learn , so no po@@ cket child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it su@@ ge@@ in@@ ence and poten@@ tially , of course .
that was then dis@@ solved by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
now that was a huge out@@ sh@@ ore , because you , of course , was starting to mani@@ fest the living language in form of writing , which is what flu@@ id and alive is , i guess what &apos;s flu@@ id and alive , i &apos;m going to try to manipu@@ late it in stone and by meas@@ uring it .
so depen@@ ding on like myself and when i &apos;m a plan@@ h , obviously , it &apos;s a very different phr@@ ase than if there &apos;s a life in a life way .
but it turned out to be the primary medium , and then you got on this ty@@ ph@@ a medium .
then the next generation came to the united states where we actually live today .
this is deta@@ ched by pressure and ti@@ pping scri@@ pt with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
at the time , it was just like an ap@@ r@@ on@@ t where as@@ pen and cl@@ ates and others have said , are you actually in@@ san@@ e when the people begins to read , and that &apos;s , of course , to talk the after@@ wards , and that &apos;s , of course , completely f@@ at@@ al .
and now we get to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , this is just every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomen@@ al phase , and we &apos;re really in this phenomen@@ al phase that we &apos;re doing something about .
of course , this conf@@ its us , because we &apos;re seeing on the one hand , new media , biot@@ l social media , facebook and so on , and
with total transpar@@ ency , which is the new thinking , which is to think of the old , don &apos;t say that in the las@@ ag@@ ne horse , and no bee@@ f fish is more or other phenomen@@ a , or other phenomen@@ a , that i want to push this just and i want to taste it .
and those two worl@@ ds are sitting up together , new and old thinking .
what &apos;s exciting about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , is de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing very many mechanis@@ ms , and principle and arch@@ a@@ ic paradig@@ ms from from the tri@@ be society .
now , not anymore on a local level , but on a global level .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that the top@@ ic of ec@@ ology is a global one .
not if i think local animals think that , and the neighb@@ or thinks less e@@ col@@ o@@ gical , then it can &apos;t work anymore .
that , from the local village , is actually a global village has become the same principles with the same principles , particularly , of course , experiment@@ ally intui@@ tive , but also total transpar@@ ency .
as you know then in the village , who has who made what happens to who and when , today , it happens about this exten@@ sion of our own self-@@ assem@@ bly devices on a global level on a global scale .
it may be that we know glob@@ ally pus@@ hing glob@@ ally and more and more and more .
like , as soon as it used to be on the village , it happened .
before the background , i just keep looking at this , which is still , which is still for us , what &apos;s also natural to us , what have we been trying to do , but what is instin@@ ctive to us , so what does the difference look like ?
because often people come from , they can &apos;t be used so that everybody can ed@@ it with it .
so you have to engage with what &apos;s said because this , and not just reali@@ zing it that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s also going to become better .
and whenever it &apos;s , of course , something intui@@ tive , and how can i take account as a character , and make things so that it makes a user friend@@ ly , so that they &apos;re intui@@ tive , so accu@@ rate , because then they do fun and they &apos;re simple to use
as you &apos;re talking , even during the study , with the issue of perception and cogni@@ tion .
and that , of course , is what you started and look like and say , okay , okay , i &apos;ll just look inside the inner self .
and what does it look like in there ?
so how do we work when we look in there ?
and what does , of course , means intui@@ tively , and how does our chan@@ n@@ els work of perception , and how does the cognitive process@@ ing work ?
because steve jobs said you might be feeling a web to see it ask it .
so you really have to look in detail , if i want to make something finan@@ cially or intui@@ tively , what does that mean in the core .
and you can see that a seven senses is , you have a seven senses , most people think we have only five , now it &apos;s seven recogni@@ zed , certainly in the near future , the next , hon@@ est@@ ing to our self , and as an exten@@ sion again of our own self
and let &apos;s see , how do we take information , how do we take information on ?
by all , what is information ? what is information ?
information is any difference that is worth a difference .
a lot of use the word , but at least not what it means to be detail .
but i have to understand in the core , in the character , when information is going to information , when are out of data and from information , and diagno@@ ses from information , so i know how i can make things intui@@ tive or , of course , make mobile .
and of course , how does creation take impact on perception .
we see this here , when i com@@ pla@@ in things , then i can make them conf@@ using like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can actually make it intui@@ tively , by showing things .
so a lot of natural , it &apos;s in a car , but i see a bit directly where &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er in there .
and when i tell someone , give me s@@ alt or pe@@ pp@@ er , he will make a difference at the right time , where is what is in there .
and then at the left just intui@@ tively ad@@ mit@@ ted , and then hopefully me , there &apos;s no sugar in there that is going to give s@@ alt right now .
but also , our perception even , how con@@ cre@@ te as we con@@ cre@@ te .
for instance , this perception in the context .
the right circle looks larger than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re par@@ tly the same size , and yet our awareness depen@@ ds on what context we put things in .
does anyone know what this is ?
come on here .
so the zon@@ ing manufacturing should still work .
there &apos;s going to be a little bit of it to my glas@@ ses .
so it &apos;s &apos; round .
a second circle has already be@@ gun to cor@@ rect or associ@@ ate certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
and if i &apos;m going to bor@@ row another hal@@ bo@@ val , we don &apos;t suddenly see another unit , which is traffic , circle and , but we see an operation , we don &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , a circle , a different one .
this is what we call man@@ ony law or kind of a gest@@ ur@@ ous psychology that also tells us to influence perception .
and what &apos;s important for character , acci@@ dent@@ ally , in the first se@@ me@@ ster , the great scale laws .
sculp@@ t@@ ary law of the continu@@ ity , the son@@ ary law of the continu@@ ity and so on .
many times in the third time , they &apos;ve for@@ gotten again
but that &apos;s a cru@@ cially important compon@@ ent when you want to make things intui@@ tively to make things intui@@ tive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the visual vision .
sounds very rural to ban@@ al , but exc@@ ell@@ ent when you &apos;re trying to be able to focus with it .
so we have the eyes at the front , and now you think , we &apos;re seeing from the beginning to back .
that &apos;s fal@@ se .
you see the way back from the back .
that is , they pro@@ j@@ y a hin@@ t on the front that they see what they &apos;re repli@@ c@@ ating , most like cul@@ tially .
that is , we just no@@ j@@ gle our vision before we see it back down into the back of our se@@ a@@ machine , to say , okay .
i have this cognitive re@@ ference , you know , you pro@@ j@@ y what you want to see .
so , that &apos;s there , that &apos;s coming back again .
and then we go back to the front , because the back at the back doesn &apos;t , and say , now there &apos;s really looking for me again , and sure if what you see is , even if what you see , even what you want to see .
and then it &apos;s back back@@ wards , and then it &apos;s just seen it first .
so a very , very exciting process of how certain things happen and what micro@@ -@@ second shapes happen to do these things .
i don &apos;t know who of you to know this picture .
that &apos;s exactly the same thing i &apos;ve just called .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s reali@@ zing .
does anybody look at something ?
it &apos;s a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , exactly .
if i saw that , that &apos;s because there &apos;s a d@@ al@@ mati@@ er in it , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore , because i &apos;ll show you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is .
now you can look at the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
and keep on , now you see it always .
that means i actually have them sho@@ ot@@ ed them , that they don &apos;t see any patterns in it , but i have it using them in a little short time , and i &apos;ve been using this dog in this sen@@ sa@@ te picture .
and this is this proje@@ ction of vision , ta@@ pe , vision .
now , i know here , and now i pro@@ j@@ ie@@ te to the front that i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
i look at the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
so quite exciting processes that you &apos;re doing in this , yeah , gra@@ y is not actually , but here in this ro@@ ck@@ en mass , it happens in this ro@@ ck@@
anyone know what three seconds are ?
, yeah , yes .
that &apos;s our final present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , i sort of can &apos;t live out of the present in the past during the past loo@@ p , i can also pin@@ ch it very well when i always do it by playing somebody with three seconds .
that &apos;s what he has to first process as a present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can &apos;t bridge very elegan@@ t moments for example in the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what does 85 milli@@ seconds take up ?
yeah , milli@@ seconds .
also , a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time of love in which you fall in love .
that means obser@@ vation , if you know that , you pay attention to who you &apos;re looking like , because i don &apos;t trans@@ mit there for a lot of equipment , which then can happen cor@@ rec@@ tly .
and six billion seconds , a very interesting phenomenon as well .
that &apos;s the period of most of the per@@ cep@@ tions that we have .
so , that &apos;s , this first impres@@ sion is happening in a fast fast speed , how we percei@@ ve things .
and we also see what we look like , and how we protect ourselves against our environment , so that we can think about it so that it &apos;s so important .
of course , designers are not just about the top@@ ic and neu@@ ral process@@ ing or neu@@ ral process@@ ing or cogni@@ tion@@ y , but of course , the issue of human@@ -@@ object relationship .
so , how does a human with certain things become about things .
there &apos;s also product language , so the practical fun@@ ctions , so form@@ als or for@@ mal@@ es@@ thetic aspe@@ cts of things .
there are artic@@ les fun@@ ctions , where i know exactly where to attack , where i need to choose .
but there are symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , so why does anybody put anything for a little break , where almost would someone fit in , so hor@@ ley su@@ ms to money , even though it &apos;s not that handy ?
we &apos;re more on symbo@@ lic , on the meaning of meaning that we &apos;re facing as a m@@ old of , of course , as a m@@ old .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the subject , which , of course , lies after that , is us@@ ability .
us@@ ability always means , how can i hold such a simple goal , or how can a users in a particular use , even an effective use in a particular use , are going to achieve an effective and satis@@ fying an end .
that &apos;s what &apos;s more likely to call the nor@@ m .
how can i make something that makes you useful friend@@ ly ?
can i keep it right or i need &apos; man@@ ual man@@ ual , or i need training to do that .
and less us@@ able or cont@@ amin@@ ative is it .
i mean that i do it differently and makes it beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better hand@@ le .
you have to understand that as well .
and then , par@@ tly , if you par@@ tially the software that we &apos;ve just seen , you &apos;re also going to understand why nin@@ e-@@ century percent of our software today or not is useful on the opini@@ ons , the i@@ -@@ pad in many areas or i@@ -@@ phones , even though it &apos;s wid@@ ely more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
and tradition@@ ally , of course , intui@@ tive gene@@ bility has not only ever been known since apple a fundamental economic factor , but i would like to use a technologi@@ cal situation if i want to use a technologi@@ cal devices to people
so why ?
because in typically , we usually use this new kind of ver@@ ability , which is the natural user mary , which is about five times at the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make some of the classi@@ cal so@@ cks , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , you have an hour of this new body .
that doesn &apos;t mean you can probably go home four hours worth home , but your emplo@@ yer , or someone , you will think , you &apos;ll probably fall to work with the four hours .
i want to say that for us , it &apos;s , of course , an exc@@ ell@@ ence to also make possible some things .
so if we were to take back again into the real@@ m of software , here &apos;s the first paper and gang inter@@ faces that were very abstra@@ ct , where you used months to deal with these systems .
then the next ones that have now with the ne@@ me neu@@ ral model or mental model like software e@@ er@@ gon@@ mer , you &apos;ve worked , you have an idea of something , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer able to make the computer .
so no longer zer@@ o@@ es and ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but just a metaphor .
this made the whole amount of user friend@@ ly , but it &apos;s also much better , of course .
the next generation of the wikipedia user of the graphic user is working a lot more with behavior .
so , as a designers , i love a lot more frequ@@ ent than what the behavior is .
that &apos;s also a paradig@@ m shift .
that i suddenly realized that finding that look more un@@ important to success , just the us@@ ability is going to be a ap@@ p .
and if i go back to these natural content into these natural content patterns , where i am by voice , by language , in touch , per gest@@ ure , in a gest@@ ure and a cur@@ sor that needs to ta@@ x things , i &apos;m still quick@@ er and even immedi@@ ate .
but , again , that brings me back to the point , when things are actually more intui@@ tive ?
if you get more intui@@ tive , and then i have to el@@ ev@@ ate my little friend again and look at my little friend , what does that mean from the point of cognitive ser@@ gon@@ om@@ y , when is it really interesting ?
and that &apos;s always intui@@ tive for us humans , if i have to think about it a little bit about it .
so , it doesn &apos;t seem to think , it doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s going to make it easy .
well , the less i think about it , the more intui@@ tive it is .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
that means , if we look at exi@@ sting forms of exi@@ sting models from you on something , for example , the metaphor , i can make it ton@@ ing as a function .
that means , i can only put an intui@@ tive , human action model on a software , and make the software a fully user friend@@ ly .
now , of course , the question is , what is the most intui@@ tive pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of us people , and now i &apos;ve already hin@@ ted it .
this is what we call the o@@ si@@ tt model .
this uses all of us and o@@ ar &apos;s an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m and represents an ori@@ ent , sel@@ ec@@ ting , in@@ formed , in@@ j@@ esti@@ ed .
it makes all of you all the time , but it &apos;s un@@ consci@@ ously doing it , and pretty intui@@ tive , or par@@ tly instin@@ ctive .
the model is already stre@@ t@@ ched in the wom@@ b and is inter@@ cul@@ tur@@ ally , so it works in young and old , so it &apos;s going to work in young and old , and it will use all of us , without even knowing that this model is here
o@@ de o@@ di@@ on is going to ever be active to activity about 50 to 7@@ 0s from us , so on the sleep , you realize that it &apos;s going to be fewer common@@ ed than a day .
so i can viol@@ ate this mental action model , sele@@ ct , in@@ formed , trans@@ forming trans@@ actions on an interaction system .
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , simil@@ arly like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but not another metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a trade pattern , but a metaphor of a trade pattern .
and this is on a higher gra@@ ve of user friend@@ ness than the trans@@ mission of a classi@@ cal metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top .
and when i &apos;m going to run this , for example , in which i am imag@@ ining this as a sha@@ dow of over@@ sight , sel@@ ec@@ ting as choice , in@@ forming in the tra@@ cks , it comes up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , surro@@ ws is it , and i can throw it somewhere or buy somebody and what@@ so@@ ever and so on .
then i can trans@@ mit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to take you through one example .
everyone &apos;s already e@@ aten ca@@ ke .
re@@ view : now , i sort of interact with the object , you can zo@@ om out , zo@@ om out , zo@@ om in .
i &apos;m getting the whole over@@ look , so now i can filter on this now , and i can only say , show me all with cho@@ col@@ ate .
and all of a sudden , you have an interface , which is more intui@@ tive and very much more natural .
because i can take things like the pieces , tou@@ ch , and they come up to me , is essentially more natural than if about hier@@ arch@@ ical organized sites or other mechanis@@ ms , such available to these things can be acc@@ essi@@ ble .
plan is more phot@@ us-@@ than@@ ic , and with that sentence i want to also stop , a and again , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in that sense thank you , i thank you very much for your attention and for requ@@ est .
i want to help you to help you a very specific aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
the first thing , when you become a child , when you &apos;re a baby , is that you care about what stri@@ kes you like , yeah ? and according to whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the po@@ ckets , the more , kind of , so , your curi@@ osity is attra@@ ctive to it , the more , so , your curi@@ osity is attra@@
and the curi@@ osity is not learning .
so these are all of you who are here and curious , actually people who have any characteri@@ stic that you can &apos;t learn .
so i &apos;m here to create basically this entire environmental discussion , cap@@ re@@ ment , 4@@ 0-@@ years clu@@ b@@ -@@ func@@ tion@@ ing , to transform in quality .
and there is a central point of it .
and that &apos;s depen@@ dent on phosp@@ hor@@ us .
cheap pe@@ e a chance .
every day , you give + sam@@ ples to about two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and every day you have to capture two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us every day .
otherwise , you can &apos;t have any teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have ro@@ b@@ b@@ b@@ ones .
we could just fli@@ p across the world as an am@@ or@@ ph@@ h m@@ oll@@ et .
in fact , we don &apos;t actually capture and give up phosp@@ hor@@ us .
what &apos;s amazing is that we &apos;re now working with something here that would be safe , but not like that .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but no one is talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
the phosp@@ hor@@ h problem is a lot of cri@@ tic@@ ical .
we dep@@ end up from two countries .
we &apos;ve only been plo@@ wing over two years of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and already by the phosp@@ hor@@ -@@ bubble glob@@ ally , through the environment , much more ur@@ ani@@ um in the environment than are used in all atom@@ ic plants .
in the last two decades alone , there have been 15 thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ um in our fields in germany .
and we assu@@ me that all up .
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in kids .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less har@@ m@@ ful .
so , for example , sh@@ ri@@ tz the environment , pit@@ ches go less car .
sh@@ ri@@ tz the environment , make less waste .
sh@@ in@@ tz the environment , consum@@ ing less energy .
but that &apos;s not an protection .
that &apos;s , as if i say i &apos;m saying , don &apos;t throw it your child , it &apos;s three times rather than five times .
that &apos;s just a little less mis@@ er@@ ance .
if we think of something like that black@@ er to the ba@@ sti@@ e , our whole earth has so@@ on@@ ed or later a ce@@ me@@ ard .
so thinking of the dig@@ ni@@ ty to think about the black@@ na .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground , first .
in the ground , over six percent of the carbon stor@@ es .
right now , we &apos;re building cor@@ n , and we lose 3@@ 0-@@ 50 kil@@ ogra@@ ms of 3@@ 7 tons per he@@ ct@@ are per he@@ ct@@ are , or record at the square meter .
that means we lose in the bottom about five times more than new@@ ly becoming new@@ -@@ time .
we can , of course , look at the de@@ ck of the de@@ br@@ is .
and it &apos;s all pac@@ k@@ aging or content .
for example , in bro@@ b@@ u , for example , the tw@@ ent@@ y of the waste has been su@@ el@@ able to wind@@ wood .
and because we &apos;re older , we get more li@@ vers that are going to get bigger .
it &apos;s kind of all in the pre@@ ven@@ tion line .
yes ?
one baby needs about six thousand war@@ le@@ a@@ l .
we could reduce that , of course , by 10 percent , but what does it do ?
that &apos;s bal@@ an@@ ced in china in a second .
this is completely o@@ wes@@ ome .
so the question is , how are we going to do with these kinds of win@@ ds ?
here , one of the evidence , by the way , is that men are not pig@@ s .
so i want to tell you .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is em@@ it@@ ted in the pi@@ g on the soli@@ d components of ex@@ cre@@ ents .
with the people of the ur@@ ine .
ye@@ p .
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s with that .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s happened , right ?
tradition@@ ally , we think in environmental debate , we are too many in the world .
and if you look at the people who have lost it , if you say , it &apos;s better , you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not there , you get re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ate and ho@@ sti@@ le .
and so , somebody like al gore , one of our big hero@@ es , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabili@@ zing the human population .
in israel , you say , if you save a human life , you attra@@ cted the earth .
here it says , the more you rever@@ se , the better .
ye@@ p .
so the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the mass of the ants on earth , ants are about four times larger than we are .
i could do ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the united states , no one may see ter@@ mit@@ es in that far , even though they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans .
that means the ants themselves wei@@ gh a lot more than we do .
and because they &apos;re physi@@ cally a lot harder to work than we do , and because of them only three to six months , they &apos;re doing their weight , in the energy consumption , a little 7@@ 0-@@ billion billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re away , what we could really do , and how sad we are , is that , for instance , we &apos;re ever on the earth , you can see that , for instance , open@@ b@@ ach has a program , until 20 percent you want to be here is cli@@ man@@ le , right ?
you can just be cli@@ man@@ ari@@ l if you don &apos;t exist in india . yeah ?
only the only opportunity .
have you ever seen a cli@@ man@@ -@@ neu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
yes ?
one only ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be ji@@ mot@@ es as a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is a carb@@ on-@@ neu@@ tra@@ l .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , right ?
there is no low-@@ population problem of trees .
there are still six billion trees in the ama@@ zon@@ ons alone .
have you heard some of that before , some low-@@ population problems from trees ?
that means all our intelligence is that we want to be ji@@ mot@@ es as a tree .
and where you see , even with something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ ct bio@@ -@@ d agriculture , don &apos;t allow that our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ s@@ m products are going back .
every year , we alone lose three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us that really has to go back in circu@@ lation .
and we &apos;re over@@ -@@ pl@@ enti@@ ed .
everybody &apos;s on it .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty about the world that we say . there is no bio@@ market , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no bi@@ ol@@ i pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s , and as you call everyone who allows us to go back our own ex@@ cre@@ ces .
isn &apos;t that deli@@ ght@@ ful ?
that we are too many .
it &apos;s sur@@ ely comfortable to be less har@@ m@@ ful , which causes oil consumption .
now , where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a huge foot@@ print that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it &apos;s about the environment , the highest is to be there , yes ?
nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ lation , yes ?
they can have zer@@ k deter@@ gent if they &apos;re not there .
even if they were sho@@ ot@@ ing now , they would have emis@@ sions .
so they can &apos;t solve it at all .
we can do it a different .
we can get rid of our own nutri@@ ents .
we do in brazil agriculture , where we get rid of nutri@@ ents .
right directly , we can get nutri@@ ents back in agriculture in this way .
so we in china do this in china , for instance , where we take the waste away .
in china , a wor@@ ker is still hon@@ ey sle@@ eping today , so yes , yeah ?
and in our universe , we were always too du@@ m@@ b to bring back our nutri@@ ents .
that means , all of western civili@@ zations &apos; history is characteri@@ zing that the city has only taken , but the farmers never left back .
that &apos;s what the cities needed to grow more and more , because the farmers went into the cities , and the cities kept growing away their nutri@@ ents .
all of the western king@@ dom is exp@@ and@@ ing , until they haven &apos;t reach@@ ed the infrastructure , and then they are im@@ plo@@ cked .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done fra@@ cer civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;re always able to get back to the nutri@@ ents .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to the food in china , you expect for the eat that you stay ti@@ ll you &apos;re looking for the toi@@ let .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents .
they did her to eat them for dinner , not to the fuel the@@ ft .
that means you can see on the internet , how you can get rid of nutri@@ ents .
this actually is nice about this , if you do this , which creates agriculture , bi@@ og@@ as , on a he@@ ct@@ are country with five thousand dollars in fa@@ vel@@ as , so a farmer could pay about a thou@@ sand@@ -@@ ac@@ re hundred dollars , and the plant will wait , chi@@ ck@@ ens and pi@@ cks and vege@@ tables and fish .
and the great thing is that crimin@@ al rate rate goes down in the fa@@ vel@@ as by over 9@@ 2 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be quite bad to do .
we can encoura@@ ge them to be good .
this is of course high-@@ tech agriculture , but the plants are wearing themselves .
the side of the net is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed , through the design that a farmer can just organi@@ ze it .
that is , that &apos;s what the crime rates go back with .
and none of these fun@@ ds , we &apos;ve built over 100 decades now in the last two decades , none of these rules were ever s@@ ab@@ ot@@ ed .
you could just throw a li@@ ter al@@ port into a li@@ ter , and then the plant would be ru@@ ined for years .
don &apos;t find any .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be poor to do so .
we can encoura@@ ge them to be good .
that is , we have to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and by the way , if you want to do something out of it , they write up , in germany , best of all the necessary facili@@ ties that &apos;s in fr@@ her@@ t .
unfortunately , they don &apos;t do that in the ex@@ bas@@ na , but maybe you can help the j@@ win a little bit .
because the women &apos;s facili@@ ty could get the phosp@@ hor@@ us back to phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and that has to go back .
we see it is really critical that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s practic@@ ed .
we &apos;ve been using us for three years in h@@ oll@@ and now .
the du@@ tch government has expla@@ ined that they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , that &apos;s sent phosp@@ hor@@ us .
but we need that all in common .
you know , there are two countries that control nearly 7@@ 0-@@ percent percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us phosp@@ hor@@ us .
there &apos;s the op@@ e@@ c a bunch of or@@ phan@@ a bus@@ hes .
that &apos;s six hundreds of countries that control 40 percent of the oil prote@@ cted supply .
and the oil will replace we can re@@ define by other energy car@@ ri@@ ers .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosp@@ hor@@ us .
so that &apos;s not about making the exi@@ sting a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and the first time is , i wonder what the right thing is .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , it &apos;s not about efficiency .
in h@@ oll@@ and , of course , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in h@@ oll@@ and , the country is built on flo@@ wers .
yes ?
imagine if for example , your wife is sad , if you &apos;ve picked them up , and you come with fif@@ ty ro@@ ses .
u@@ pli@@ c@@ ely in@@ efficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , yeah ?
or take a li@@ p@@ pet pen .
a woman in germany e@@ ats about six com@@ bat three kil@@ ogra@@ ms during her lifetime .
this .
this is not most scienti@@ fically accu@@ rate , because we don &apos;t know how much away is going to be cool .
but a li@@ p pen , even in that ill@@ um@@ ination , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but it &apos;s completely effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s why you don &apos;t have resource efficiency , but efficiency .
asking what &apos;s right ? what is the right thing ?
not to burn the s@@ w@@ um up a little bit better , and dra@@ g@@ ging it and burn it in the recycl@@ ing plant the entire material for pi@@ vers to lose , but first time to ask , how does you stop pac@@ king pac@@ k@@ ages ?
imagine mo@@ z@@ art more effici@@ ently .
yes ?
if i put you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tab@@ let with open fla@@ vor and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; right ?
this is efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with someone , effici@@ ently ?
yes ?
that is , everything that coun@@ ts in life is not to save , to avoid , to reduce .
the whole environmental debate .
we say to people , oh , you don &apos;t have an environmental consciousness in the south .
no , it kno@@ cks away exactly the right , right ?
at every location where you take away , from , yes , you build life back into life .
but the fal@@ se things .
if you take away the wrong things , you have a waste problem .
in how we think about the north .
there &apos;s each source of foot@@ print .
if you walk , yes , each foot@@ print destro@@ ys the floor .
because the soil is going to die the mo@@ s@@ ses , and the wind will die the floor , and the water was@@ hes the floor .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means that the water rema@@ ins longer in the me@@ a@@ dow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large foot@@ print that becomes a we@@ t@@ land .
not gu@@ il@@ d@@ al management .
we say in germany &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you do that with your wife ?
so what do you say ?
sur@@ ely sustainable .
and then i say , he@@ al sorry , yes ?
this is now at the minim@@ um .
so not to save , sc@@ ru@@ pt , avoid .
each tr@@ ence is nutri@@ ent .
and it &apos;s a bet when you see in it@@ al@@ y , as people throw out in the high bo@@ w like this , and they go out of the car .
because , you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s a form of re@@ vi@@ ves , yeah ?
you can show , i &apos;ve been there .
but with the right design , here we go .
so , for example , we developed a ice me@@ m@@ ble pac@@ k@@ aging that &apos;s liquid temperature at room temperature .
they can fli@@ p them off where they go and stand .
in two hours , they build all over the place .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants so they fla@@ p through the bio@@ diversity to bio@@ diversity .
that is , we &apos;re useful , we &apos;re not har@@ m@@ ful .
so there are two pac@@ k@@ ages .
not to , of course , be com@@ post@@ able .
a television or a was@@ hing machine , they just use that , they don &apos;t consu@@ me them .
just the things that disappe@@ ars , like sho@@ ot@@ ing , like bra@@ ke bel@@ ts , like business , that you have to be that they go into biological systems .
the things that are just being used are going in technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yes ?
direct adverti@@ sing , not for the company , pu@@ ma per se , but for you now to help this company succe@@ ed to succe@@ ed these products .
because we don &apos;t do things more free from it .
yes ?
so when i invi@@ te you to the food and say , &quot; that &apos;s free from cre@@ ars , you don &apos;t feel anything .
no , we cl@@ ari@@ fy what &apos;s in there .
not very positive .
so it &apos;s not like de@@ tat@@ x .
not tox@@ ality in there .
it &apos;s all useful , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put the ca@@ val@@ age pop on the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an bot@@ le and go into organic loo@@ ses , right ?
everything of them is com@@ post@@ able to it .
and if we succe@@ ed , of course , it works us , of course , for o@@ des , for ni@@ ke , for mau@@ ri@@ tz , and all the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
and that &apos;s half the ab@@ water problems around the world that are going to lead by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
and that &apos;s why you help with it , ask for the people .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you really care about it ?
because now they &apos;ve changed the cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship twice .
and i &apos;m not sure they &apos;re really insu@@ going .
so , help me a little bit about this .
but this is what it is .
ye@@ p .
which was just what was repres@@ ented .
that &apos;s what it comes .
we can do things like this that , if they s@@ late when they break , they can in biological tu@@ bes .
technical cy@@ cles are the same as as .
there &apos;s a direct re@@ nam@@ toi@@ lation system .
this is the first e@@ col@@ a pack , actually , which is made to go back in the loo@@ p .
again , so in each at@@ m , you can get things back .
if you get to that , yeah ?
now , remember the gras@@ ses ?
if you have the waste right now , the waste is .
these are the flo@@ ws all over the place , almost .
in the countries where people come to buy money .
on the de@@ po@@ b@@ a , but also in the landscape , yes
if we change the plasti@@ cs so that it can go in biological systems , if we change the water ves@@ sel@@ s , inside that they can back on cell@@ u@@ lo@@ si@@ c base , you can go back with a baby in israel or in tun@@ isi@@ a hundred hundred trees .
yes ?
just when you take that fla@@ g , you dis@@ cu@@ re , you c@@ ili@@ ze , ster@@ ili@@ ze and take the po@@ w@@ der to plant trees .
so the baby is healthy for the whole life , right up from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , we can be air@@ -@@ positive .
it &apos;s kind of a controlled po@@ me drawing .
yeah , that &apos;s .
yes ?
that &apos;s something we can do .
we can re@@ con@@ ci@@ le it again .
i fo@@ unded an institute .
mean@@ while there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they all can be ac@@ tively enga@@ ged .
there is extra ent@@ ry to com@@ mit cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le , where anyone can participa@@ te .
so no longer save , sc@@ ru@@ ba , avoid , ti@@ mber , no scho@@ ol management , but smart waste .
does she explain that curious ?
thank you very much .
the work of the interpre@@ ts .
music is as a language .
in the descri@@ ption about my talk , i wrote that i as a quote , i as a transl@@ ator , a english wor@@ thy , understand .
com@@ po@@ unded are con@@ fron@@ ted the notes of the written notes in sequ@@ ing music .
because as a transl@@ ator , you don &apos;t just over@@ line word for word to another language , but also to understand the deep sense of words and spo@@ c@@ us@@ ry to understand there &apos;s a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , know anybody who has to do it with alien languages .
even from transl@@ ating into english in english , more knowledge can disc@@ uss , even if you &apos;re then about poetry , even more poetry can be .
certainly , it &apos;s for la@@ ia , what we &apos;re doing with musi@@ cians with our music language .
so as a interpre@@ t of a piece of music , i first have the cele@@ br@@ ated notes .
you think that the vot@@ ed in the sound has written into the notes of what he thought there was .
in fact , the notes are very va@@ gue and un@@ pre@@ cis@@ ely .
these notes are about equi@@ ctly exactly or in@@ accu@@ rate , like a verb@@ al , when also very appar@@ ent , very appar@@ entation of a landscape .
because in this verb@@ al landscape , the smell of the flo@@ wers is not to smell , the degree of the green , to not knowing , is not to hear the win@@ des of the wind .
that is , to say that interpre@@ t to these un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented statistics of speech language into another , that &apos;s transl@@ ating audi@@ ble , con@@ cre@@ te , non-@@ verb@@ al music language .
today i want to share with you what else else is doing music , so i transl@@ ate it , again to transl@@ ating into a verb@@ al language .
so , essentially , a trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
so i suggest@@ ed to do this whole way of doing it in fi@@ er@@ ch , because if i had to trans@@ late it to english , it would be consi@@ der@@ ably trans@@ lation to trans@@ lation .
so , so , the music works for me as much as spo@@ ken language .
the lou@@ ded notes have the function of the letters of a ty@@ scri@@ bed .
so it doesn &apos;t allow me to only learn just to learn how to press and press the butt@@ ons on the piano or the right place on a vi@@ o@@ lin .
that would be just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of letter you can only dete@@ ct if you can do the language .
so for that learning process , for the learning process of music music , you need at least as long as spo@@ ken language .
there are also sur@@ ve@@ ys , whether you &apos;re learning it for sal@@ uses , only passi@@ ve understanding , or you can also talk to the musical na@@ tive speak@@ ers .
the work of the interpre@@ t is kind of begins like a theater director .
once you first cho@@ se a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you start to study after the creation of com@@ position .
you accu@@ mu@@ late information about the play in the classroom liter@@ ature .
you read in the letters , in general , notes , notes , or whether there &apos;s words , thoughts of com@@ pos@@ ing itself .
they &apos;re studying the work that he &apos;s com@@ posed before and after .
you &apos;ll ex@@ tend compar@@ ison .
the conditions to write it .
how did he feel like what he was reali@@ zing ?
what were its environments like the society and the politics like the politics ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
you &apos;re thinking in this time , in this period , for example , con@@ temporary images or liter@@ ature .
but over time , you have also as a re@@ mark a ri@@ che knowledge about the com@@ pos@@ er you play more , and it falls and it falls and it falls to feel in it .
the com@@ pos@@ er is going to be more like more for the friend you live with .
his desire to write the play , it will become more and more in my personal concern@@ s to play it .
so , since the notes are now played everything else than a pre@@ cise record of the com@@ pos@@ er , it &apos;s just a frame@@ work , now i now turn this sc@@ aff@@ old to make sense and signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce .
and i &apos;m telling you , with my own words , what could be written between this frame@@ work .
i &apos;ll play expla@@ ining what this sound could have to mean .
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ er at the time , and what you might mean today , and what you might mean for him today .
every clay , every phr@@ ase gets a sense to it , because i feel it myself , because it &apos;s coming out of my current current .
it has to me for me in this and now now , i cannot convince my audience to believe that that &apos;s my business .
it &apos;s a very happy conc@@ ert again , if i may have the experience , the play that i &apos;ve spent so long in thinking about how to re@@ live how long ago .
how you learn a happy new day again , even though always with the same ritu@@ als of life , up , get up , break@@ fast , to work , i &apos;m also going to do the same thing over and over again .
i &apos;ve become older once a day to switch seas@@ ons , my pul@@ se goes slo@@ wer at night than in the morning , in a conc@@ ert room , it takes longer to get the sound back than at home .
i choose to brea@@ the the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
all this is influ@@ enced me , and this is also affec@@ ting my experience with com@@ position .
the same thing is , if i stand on the stage with a du@@ o mate on the stage , and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
and then the same way is happening as in a good , well-@@ inten@@ tioned conversation .
you bring in a new idea , and then what that tells is it &apos;s ans@@ wer@@ ed with a response .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that happen to happen , and what you can &apos;t do , and what you can &apos;t sam@@ ple .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience have experienced how the music communic@@ ates lives .
so each conc@@ ert is a different con@@ cer@@ tual .
i will never play more like this , like that moment .
i can &apos;t play any like this today as in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and so on , i &apos;m going to on my pal@@ ette of music sounds even more color and emotion and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some color po@@ ts also satur@@ ated out , but to get new ones .
have a nice con@@ cre@@ te example of that .
it was on a piano cur@@ lage for music students at my belo@@ ved old teacher , professor je@@ wel@@ s , a famous be@@ tho@@ v@@ -@@ speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert bee@@ tho@@ dor@@ -@@ speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert professor in musical school here in stu@@ ber@@ y .
unfortunately , i was too young to be , so he already was mir@@ r@@ ated when i finally started studying
but i had the privi@@ lege to meet him very early , with three years , to meet , and so i was on his clas@@ ses at my school school .
i was seven se@@ vent@@ h , at the time i partici@@ p@@ ated on one of his cour@@ ses , and i played the last of the four hor@@ ses of ch@@ op@@ in , a day .
he asked me what the im@@ position of this bal@@ let for me was .
that &apos;s a bit of a ge@@ tra@@ l .
and in my ju@@ od@@ ness , i said , expec@@ tan@@ cy .
he mil@@ ted and said , like , is this ?
that has to be the aging difference .
because for me , she &apos;s remem@@ ber@@ ed .
he &apos;s been around six .
well , with se@@ vent@@ h , you &apos;ve got dreams still , but not great memor@@ ies .
i play the piece today all the time , and always it &apos;s turned for me , even though there has not changed a single note .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i read something new , because over and over , i read something new .
an example of this is from a very different area . mon@@ et pain@@ ted the se@@ a@@ ses around the j@@ mal .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in different days of day , in different light .
and he transl@@ ated the se@@ cular rou@@ te of transi@@ tion , as he saw it , as it was doing at the time .
his own personal speci@@ fication of the se@@ ac@@ ands .
the x-@@ fil@@ t task of one piece of it is analog@@ ous .
in now , i &apos;ve been getting older than ch@@ op@@ in at 2@@ 3@@ 0,000 years when he wrote the piece .
he hasn lived only nine years .
and i &apos;m important to look at the notes again , even if i mean , to memor@@ ize them .
to hold zi@@ gi@@ d , right with com@@ pos@@ ers .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
most of all , if he &apos;s been dead .
now , how do you start to talk about the language of music ?
so i said yes , you need about as long as you for spo@@ ken language .
now often , music is like reading the notes that you only learn the pun@@ ch .
you learn very much first to read the word before you just talk about a word .
you learn to find the notes to the sounds on the instrument .
then , when all the fing@@ ers in time move and feel like it in the notes , then sound come out that way together that sound like music .
when the com@@ po@@ und is happening , the students get the next good piece .
it &apos;s ab@@ ab@@ ly talking about interpretation in the early trial .
all right , there &apos;s pas@@ r@@ o at the front , which is a quick piece .
len@@ to , stabili@@ ze .
lou@@ dly and squ@@ at@@ ce , t@@ f and b , etc , etc .
that &apos;s what most of us know .
but even though you rever@@ se that attack , it still sta@@ ys a little bit technical .
and yet , it &apos;s not a interpretation .
i &apos;m looking at me .
i wonder that you often forget something very element@@ ary .
that is , to make music on the instrument that should be your musical and feel there before .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s sing@@ ing .
a kid who hasn &apos;t learned that , because it doesn &apos;t make the parents , it &apos;s going to not do it by itself either .
this is like talking to the speak@@ er .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experience and idea of music , then on another possibility , about an instrument to take sound .
people who never paying attention , pretty much , they &apos;ve never felt inst@@ antly with your own body , what it is to form a note .
a phr@@ ase to design with his own brea@@ thing .
the musical instrument is because of the exten@@ sion of our bodies .
so our pen hol@@ ds to sing@@ ing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the sequ@@ el of my fing@@ ers .
the mel@@ o@@ dy ar@@ ray from the spon@@ sor@@ s and the rhyth@@ m from the dance .
the final archi@@ ve no@@ wa@@ days with music today is not stimul@@ ated .
you don &apos;t need to make music even when it gets bor@@ ed you .
no longer nee@@ ds to whi@@ st@@ le or sing@@ ing a tie .
every single music is taken to re@@ cover , if you &apos;re bitten all the time with music with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i don &apos;t sing one ?
i &apos;m asking you , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing@@ e ?
now , between either thing , it &apos;s not too late to find out if you can &apos;t even find out if you can &apos;t even learn how to put these little mus@@ cles that hi@@ re the vo@@ cal regi@@ sages .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve made it to you that they &apos;re un@@ justi@@ fied .
and i wonder , how is it tan@@ it@@ able was this diagno@@ sis ?
have you taken a second or a third reason , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful today ?
or yeah , they don &apos;t like music , and so they want to do so well .
but what i would like to re@@ gre@@ t then is because music is a beautiful , commun@@ al thing .
but maybe you can re@@ agree them .
well , you can see that all of the cases don &apos;t have to be a flas@@ h of can@@ di@@ date .
but don &apos;t just say i don &apos;t understand , i don &apos;t understand from classi@@ cal music .
i can &apos;t tell you whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and i answer , but sur@@ ely you can tell whether it like you or not .
because i don &apos;t believe , it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if i don &apos;t co@@ ok , because i don &apos;t .
well , they &apos;re not going to be eating up in the lunch just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so you don &apos;t have to ad@@ here to classi@@ cal music because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to consci@@ ously and say if it &apos;s taste you or not .
whether the music is too rop@@ ed to you or c@@ ute .
just tell what they feel .
over time , you get subje@@ cts , and you want some more sp@@ ices there , or you want to taste sen@@ ches even .
why do i con@@ form from my audience that it &apos;s actually ac@@ tively listening ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate there .
an art@@ work that you never looked at has no strength .
the food that has been coo@@ ked by a che@@ f or a che@@ f tru@@ ve , has got to be e@@ aten , not just vie@@ wed or reci@@ pes .
so please listen to when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice act of hor@@ nis@@ h .
if in an environment where adults make active music , or hear active music , a child gro@@ ws , it &apos;s just easy for a musical teacher , to ask , what color has your flo@@ wer ?
now , can you play them in blue now ?
and the child plays , after a memor@@ er before , a red flo@@ wer before a blue flo@@ wer .
and this sounds very different than before .
so that was the very first ever of a musical music prin@@ ting .
so the first step to resol@@ ve an interpretation .
and what happens if you play a piece today that has been written ini@@ tially , two and a half years ago , and it &apos;s been written by three hundred years ago ?
in the mean@@ time , the instru@@ ments have evol@@ ved .
there was no piano at the time called the piano at all at the time .
it was just not yet been invented yet .
i think the stream would have been thri@@ ll@@ ed if it had had the noise opportunity of today &apos;s modern the@@ o@@ gen .
i can have the sound values that the stream had to sound on the modern wing , on the modern wing , what a b@@ aro@@ cky c@@ em@@ bal@@ o
also , bee@@ tho@@ ven knows that he listen@@ ed to himself more when he &apos;s already become dea@@ f .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything , which has re@@ je@@ cted a orche@@ str@@ a from then as mu@@ ti@@ ble .
so the com@@ pos@@ ers to argue that are respon@@ ded to us re@@ inv@@ ading the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be listen@@ able to solving , which they &apos;ve only thought in the mind .
and also , what you would think about today is in the spirit .
or what i pre@@ tend today , because what you might think you could have thought about .
thank you very much .
you know what p@@ d is ?
have you been p@@ opti@@ n before ?
and what did that feel like ?
su@@ mm@@ on .
i have a friend , and i go a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
and when i come then , with my little v pi@@ w pi@@ es@@ le and i &apos;m listening to it , this feeling comes up .
i &apos;m sho@@ ot@@ ing something through my head .
i say , o@@ f , what to do is you have a big car ?
that &apos;s the first year half of his value in half .
and indeed , you &apos;ve been doing a lot less than me .
why would i do that kind of thing a little car ?
and then i &apos;ll stop it , that &apos;s not very fair .
it &apos;s justice against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling is away .
our organis@@ m has invented a great way to just bring these kinds of aw@@ k@@ ward feelings like just going to disappe@@ ar .
you can try to do that with words like re@@ ven@@ ge or w@@ inning and something like that .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about this mechan@@ ism today , or tell you something that &apos;s un@@ know@@ able to you .
the mechan@@ ism is made out of the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie as you may have heard you , when people say , no one has the inten@@ tion to build a wall .
and then , st@@ ones up , so he lo@@ cks sight to them .
on one of them , you can see that the li@@ ars itself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it en@@ ables you to check that it has a lot of other in mind .
he just cr@@ au@@ ps you and not themselves .
no , the lie i speak about , who has to do with it themselves .
they need this lie to preser@@ ve a life of life to keep a self-@@ de@@ ception .
they can make them less easy , yes , re@@ exam@@ ine , or put on the pi@@ p .
you &apos;ve got to have time .
from that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you may know .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once acts a woman portra@@ me .
this woman then com@@ pla@@ ined that the portra@@ it wouldn &apos;t look at her at all .
pic@@ as@@ so ans@@ wer@@ ed , wait .
it &apos;ll be more similar to you .
at this point , and if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can communicate very well .
because artists have a dis@@ rup@@ ted relationship to lie .
the artist shares you something , and particularly in this lady , what you don &apos;t see if you just look in the mirror .
the artist gives you a portra@@ it in one such portra@@ it , what you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this art@@ work over and over again .
then that un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling , it could not look like you &apos;re not seeing , and it &apos;ll get more like you and more like you .
so here you have this mechan@@ ism that we can use the lie as a great invention to stabili@@ ze our lifest@@ yle .
and not just in the arts , in the jun@@ k , in the my@@ th@@ ology , in stories , it seems to be again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him who is , who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
so behind the seven mountains and so forth .
and you know how much of ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty out of this life , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , jum@@ ped out of this true result .
but we should just be very familiar with a woman you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a smar@@ ter somewhere else .
so we need it to understand what we like under the poli@@ ked cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness , and we keep making again .
so , at this point , we need this lie that &apos;s keeping us the de@@ ception , without which we can &apos;t live to live at all .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the fol@@ k@@ i@@ cian institution , but also in science are these great lies .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman of the cho@@ cho@@ s of &quot; dun@@ che@@ ster . &quot;
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and the ab@@ und@@ ance of the man .
that the person should come from the ap@@ es , and yes , at least a common ance@@ st@@ or would have between people and ap@@ es .
and then she ran her to her husband , and she said , well , that &apos;s probably not true what charles was writing there .
people should have separ@@ ated from the mon@@ key or have a common ance@@ st@@ or .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to stop people getting knowledge of it .
why do we prevent that people know about something that it &apos;s true from something ?
because without these living lies , we can &apos;t live this life .
because we have this self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being great , occu@@ ph@@ y from the highest being , not from a kind of distin@@ ction , of something like a organis@@ m , of something as an organis@@ m that still exists , compar@@ able a stone and other kinds of things , it &apos;s un@@ sustainable for us
so , we cannot have these things at all .
we need to prevent that people know job@@ for things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly of this mechan@@ ism is cap@@ tured , and like the tra@@ ces that he leaves behind something else than this great image of ourselves , i want to make you closer to another story .
a very beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told her to tell me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she was telling him about a student .
this is an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
she might love him , because he has a tenden@@ cy to get to the point .
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
and he says , you know , i &apos;m with the fire@@ war .
and as i &apos;m with the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
yeah , you feel that if you &apos;re more tough at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said my wife , whenever a man uses in a moral order , because using the words , we should try to replace it through the narra@@ tives .
do that once , and then you &apos;ll learn the sentence .
so even though i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
you feel that this is the actual truth behind the ex@@ ecu@@ tion .
this is a little bu@@ b that &apos;s interested in fire .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s interested in fire .
but there &apos;s no sub@@ tle where we can look around where you &apos;re learning how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best thing that the fire war@@ ri@@ fi@@ ves .
and he sig@@ ned himself .
and you viol@@ ate this , you don &apos;t say your teacher is sitting somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire is was@@ hing back after the fire .
no , it doesn &apos;t look much better if we show that we &apos;re willing to elimin@@ ate the dan@@ gers that others tend to get when they &apos;re breaking fire .
and here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
this particular cla@@ im that in the front of the bu@@ b , in fact , he knew that he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that g@@ oud .
here you have this bill bridge between the un@@ conscious and the conscious that boun@@ ces on it , without you to do something about it , and the things you know that you look very different , so you can make it much better for you and others .
so , that &apos;s when we just get these words that we use in the language of poli@@ tically cor@@ rect speech and again .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
but we know that if we address that , the social lifest@@ yle is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t make this easy .
it &apos;s impossible to pres@@ ent things like this in a society that &apos;s to work .
i &apos;d like to now show you what we found in my institute .
after which lo@@ gic this de@@ ception , this self-@@ de@@ ception , the will@@ ing@@ ness , another reality than the one we actually know in the un@@ conscious , that it &apos;s val@@ id to spread out .
this is what i want to present to you with two , maybe three examples .
the first example is to predict what many of you know and some of you esti@@ mate , and some of you don &apos;t need to have a very few .
i mean , the sou@@ l .
what is the sou@@ l ?
and the sou@@ l is such a kind of mental thing , about lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
it &apos;s something that is not dur@@ able , materi@@ ally physical .
and when you have people who are the most vor@@ ly convinced that you have a sou@@ l , or you can also say that you &apos;ve been getting rid of the sou@@ l , then imagine that they &apos;ve been re@@ war@@ ded from the sou@@ l , then imagine it as if the sou@@ l would be such a spi@@ ritual frame@@ work on them , not from matter , they &apos;re just from meat and blood , something wh@@ el@@ ly , un@@ belie@@ vable , un@@ important , un@@ belie@@ vable , un@@ belie@@ vable , dead .
and from this sou@@ l you think that you &apos;re sort of in this clou@@ dy nature , in this color@@ ful nature , my@@ a is being present in la@@ tin that is present , the fun@@ k .
and when this l@@ ort is then pac@@ ked about people , it &apos;s filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with spirit , with nature that only only can live with , is just with sou@@ l .
and then it can run on it .
that &apos;s the idea of how the sou@@ l works .
so she &apos;s going to want to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to percei@@ ve them as something that &apos;s necessary to be pre@@ human@@ i@@ ous for our lives .
and if you have this desire in front of you , you can understand the lo@@ gic that we experience with that happiness , through a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a three-@@ sentence .
three phr@@ ases , they still know from school .
this is a three-@@ sentence now , which descri@@ bes us a lo@@ gic .
and that &apos;s the har@@ dest part of my talk , by the way .
here , they need some lo@@ gic , but also they lie to the will@@ ing@@ ness .
because that to lie , that you can just use this lo@@ gic .
in this three-@@ sentence , three sent@@ ences come up .
the first sentence is saying , cla@@ im , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
so the second sentence is , if sound is right , he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
now there &apos;s a third phr@@ ase .
i was doing it in a very particular one .
a third sentence that comes up immediately in people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l .
people say who don &apos;t have a sou@@ l , who &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you &apos;re feeling it .
this is this lo@@ gic in this , yes , in this de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing talk .
and you can see it immediately .
the first two sent@@ ences , they &apos;re logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
i can cla@@ im all that .
so the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make any answers about reality .
i can &apos;t say the doctor is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the doctor &apos;s in a man .
if i don &apos;t do it right , the doctor is not a man .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make any stat@@ ement about what &apos;s happening .
i can cla@@ im everything .
but cri@@ tically , if i have it right , it &apos;s just .
so when tex@@ ting says , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
secon@@ dly , when he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
and now we also feel our fa@@ vor of consciousness , from out of it you can do something .
it depen@@ ds on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences , that does that as if the opposite of the first sentence is already pro@@ ven and adop@@ ted .
because actually , we have to prove if it &apos;s there to be the sou@@ l or not .
but with this lo@@ gic that &apos;s just using it that two sent@@ ences are physi@@ cally cor@@ rect , and a third ada@@ ge that looks as if it had to do with it , we can save our li@@ lies of life .
so , we pre@@ tend that it &apos;s actually impossible without being able to live a sou@@ l .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can aug@@ ment these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example that kee@@ ps the da@@ y@@ time new@@ spa@@ pers repe@@ ating over and over again .
to give you another philosop@@ hi@@ cal subject , a perman@@ ent po@@ g from philosoph@@ y , present from philosoph@@ y .
and it has to do with that that we go back to the quad@@ 3 century .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ars , which was named jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and named that &apos;s called bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an es@@ el .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an es@@ el is a co@@ ot that is made of p@@ ure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have these sou@@ l .
it &apos;s such a natural thing .
and if you put the ex@@ act right in the middle between two iden@@ tical things , he &apos;s going to star@@ ve .
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to what the hell is going to do
so , he &apos;s right in the middle .
so , the natural things are imag@@ ined .
very large forces with op@@ pos@@ -@@ pac@@ ked sig@@ ns are recor@@ ding each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you bring another example , so if you &apos;re going to get bigger to the one mas@@ ses , he doesn &apos;t need reason , and nothing about it .
auto@@ matically , he is walking to the right idea .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re driven in nature , it &apos;s determin@@ ed by the larger group that pul@@ ls you immediately , then you quickly have the sense that there has to be something like a free thing .
and if we &apos;re at the subject here in fr@@ at@@ t , i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ h institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and he &apos;s telling him , you know , wol@@ f sing@@ er argu@@ es , there are no mer@@ gi@@ ble freedom .
now we can again create the second sentence , and we can say when wol@@ f sing@@ er is right , he doesn &apos;t have a worry of mind .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect .
and what we can read almost in the daily newspaper every day , that &apos;s what you find in this third term .
it looks like something like this doesn &apos;t have any compassion , it can &apos;t be raised for its actions and cla@@ ims to responsibility , and therefore , he is in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate .
so again , you have it again .
in fact , you have to prove if there is such a thing as willing .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to do that , as if the first sentence of previous crash is wrong , you , of course , have to accept the opposite without pro@@ pri@@ et@@ y .
and now you can just do , if you want to test yourself yourself , if you want to test yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , practice this coura@@ ge to lie .
practice that , for example , if you meet a human being that you can say to you , there &apos;s no one pri@@ den@@ it@@ ant .
and don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for the predi@@ ct , which is prop@@ he@@ t .
you don &apos;t want to name that , that would be a little bit more poli@@ tically cor@@ rect .
you say , there &apos;s no predic@@ t@@ ant .
and then you &apos;re going to one that &apos;s predi@@ ctive of these predic@@ tions , you can &apos;t prove that .
and sure enough , you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re involved in doing that you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there is no predic@@ ter , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fo@@ ol@@ ed .
because he has led it on a bri@@ ck@@ le that he doesn &apos;t end up in himself .
because actually this is not interesting to prove this human .
it &apos;s only interested in setting yourself to the need to prove that there is predic@@ t@@ ary .
so , in the kind of shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den , they experience the great dec@@ lar@@ ity of lying .
and once again , once you have a way of feeling that three-@@ sentence in other people , do it , because you will make other happy if you don &apos;t remember them for their own sa@@ ke .
i thank you for your attention .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
i was allowed to be allowed li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the gent@@ le here from this great event , and i wonder@@ ed whether i &apos;m going to give a talk here and give my idea .
i have to say , you know , you were getting it , it was hard to talk to me about my idea .
and i &apos;d probably like to introdu@@ ce my indian project that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum of all sorts , lots of ideas .
i &apos;ll probably hear , the two nice girls are there , i probably &apos;ll be to the generation that has been na@@ ked for this bad oil painting , because i &apos;ve started nin@@ e-@@ 10@@ 0-@@ hundred times &apos; 7@@ 0s to study in car@@ rot , engineering school , now she &apos;s , i think , k@@ it .
and then i ta@@ pped it to ber@@ lin in the middle of the 19@@ 80 years , because i wanted to make rene@@ w@@ ables , and i didn &apos;t have to burn it in pu@@ ff@@ s .
there was the nuclear research plant of le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ les .
everyone at the time was also the k@@ f@@ a was also the k@@ f@@ a was called k@@ f@@ a .
the project today is called project cham@@ bers .
because a good engineer has either built fab@@ ul@@ ous cars , or atom@@ ic power plants .
but something do@@ o@@ fu@@ es like &apos; sol@@ o@@ dies , made out of creating a hundred wat@@ ts from the squ@@ ar@@ es of the clim@@ b , which was a to@@ y .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a bizar@@ re engineering .
i &apos;m so gr@@ ate@@ ful to the pre@@ mi@@ um@@ -@@ col@@ a man that he had re@@ hab@@ ili@@ ed the word again , because after the fl@@ ush , you didn &apos;t have to use the word at all , because everything else was bad .
but in the &apos; 4@@ 0s , it didn &apos;t happen in the marriage years .
it used to be that there was self-@@ manage alternative businesses , and one of them was just in cross in traffic where you would consider the evil .
so , the place of terror@@ ism , but that was his el@@ tr@@ on@@ ics , and i made wind and solar power , and it &apos;s been where i started in the middle of the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
and indeed , a lot of what has been said today , i &apos;m very , because many , many beautiful effects were involved that i &apos;ve also lived through .
i worked in the colle@@ c@@ tivity for 11 years , that was fundamental democratic .
we were tw@@ ent@@ y people .
if one didn &apos;t say was the v@@ et@@ op@@ rin@@ z@@ p , which had a flo@@ od , and i spent a lot of time dou@@ bled myself for 10 years , whether i really was wa@@ sting my beautiful engineering education , because all my father &apos;s colleagues were always talking to him , you let the money break out to the window in your child .
it &apos;s famili@@ at@@ ting with sh@@ ame .
and this was really , really bit@@ ter , and you could get in this phase , and it was going to go in like this , and i was asked this a picture , where i &apos;ve been asking myself after 10 years , thousands of mar@@ ks , that at the time , is , if i asked myself , it was really that great .
and i then ate it to six hundred &apos; 95 , and then we became co-@@ &apos;s fo@@ under of company sol@@ on , which became then with the sp@@ in-@@ off company &apos;s one of the world &apos;s largest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world .
a big story , but also , we have the problem of a growing company , and we have two times a growing company , and we have two young , small numbers , decided that we &apos;re starting to get back to the next theme of the future , and that means that , and in our sense , it &apos;s equ@@ ally crazy , it starts telling people that people say , what &apos;s the hell of the chair , they don &apos;t do anything , we &apos;re talking about stor@@ ms .
and then , i &apos;ve brought you a project that i want to introdu@@ ce you now .
and the ti@@ tle of the pres@@ ence was , you get to a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and we just started asking with a relatively simple story of questions , where you could , because a memory sen@@ sation today uses a memory of trust today .
this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ or .
yes , these are the data .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
today , we have an rene@@ w@@ able energy mass of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
that just doesn &apos;t work technologi@@ cally .
if you put more wind power together , the system begins to fail .
that &apos;s what i always tell the politicians if they get in ber@@ lin ad@@ ters of our plants .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we &apos;ve already had 20 percent in germany .
there isn &apos;t a problem at all .
but it &apos;s not true , we &apos;ve got seven percent in europe , and our network is physical arab@@ ologi@@ cally the european .
if we had 40 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people on this island have already on this island .
the question was just , calcu@@ lation that was two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ th , the first cont@@ acts of the island started , let &apos;s just figure out .
how big it would actually be like such a battery so that you like an island of 20 , 30 , for@@ ty , fif@@ ty , fif@@ ty , maybe even 7@@ 7 percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go again for another .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the glo@@ be .
by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts a year will be built to the same area a year in the world .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it runs very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger of the world that &apos;s done , is er@@ ased with this el , because you don &apos;t need per@@ mission .
that &apos;ll go fast .
you put a box on it .
and then it &apos;s pretty much what it looks like .
in the course , three of the pan@@ els are always waiting , two always are waiting
yes , this is what it looks like down there , it &apos;s the load .
we &apos;ve also got very accu@@ rate data .
and the wind plant , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is usually a bri@@ ck system , or whatever it is , is a bri@@ ck system , and it &apos;s a system that can only feed here in small quanti@@
our goal was to just say , okay , we ...
the whole thing is going to be called the whe@@ el and the wind , the sun is helping the load , that they can map the bigger species .
and if you want to go for 20 , 30 percent rene@@ w@@ able energy , energy per year , not power per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the universe .
that &apos;s , right now , you have to make sure that rene@@ w@@ ables effectively can cost the entire net .
of course , you can only , you can , of course , be man@@ ual in some way .
it hasn &apos;t done that before in the world .
so that &apos;s in a small way , so you can in the car also care in your car about a little bit of a shift .
people always ask me , what do you do learn to do in ad@@ ve@@ sh@@ ard ?
this is what we do .
but if you want to separate together multiple of these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and you want to build a network , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to 7@@ 0s to 9@@ 40 percent rene@@ w@@ able , and then there &apos;s another rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent rene@@ w@@ able to rene@@ w@@ able , that &apos;s going to become very , very expensive , and that will not work either that you &apos;re making that from bat@@ ter@@ ies .
that will definitely be a energy contain@@ er that , then , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas , you can be it or c@@ it , it will be it .
you also have to go for a seas@@ on memor@@ er and winter summer , and not just touch ge@@ ars night .
we just wanted to know what is it about a normal , ra@@ c@@ less , tro@@ sti@@ le battery .
so how far do you get there ?
and then , a whole bunch of simu@@ lations .
and we &apos;ve combin@@ ed wind and sun and the bur@@ den , and came to the result , a very interesting out@@ come that you need for the conven@@ tional system that takes a middle stro@@ mp of about 50 years per kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour , about 4@@ 0-@@ 40 cents a kil@@ o@@ watt hour .
these were the very first calcu@@ lations that calcu@@ lation six years ago .
and then we said , all right .
so , we have great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re che@@ aper like the same system , when the same price is ris@@ ing five percent a year .
and then we &apos;ve started negoti@@ ating with insu@@ lan@@ ers .
what would it have to do ?
have been negoti@@ ated with inv@@ e@@ stors , i &apos;ve see@@ ked new food she@@ ers .
we were only five people at the time to re@@ build one to the society .
and this is again the picture .
the brown is sort of the conven@@ tional system , the green is our system .
that our system has also ris@@ en for a price , is that we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with dies@@ el , and we &apos;re also not going to push a price on the other things .
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty , which is the electricity company on the island , lead to that , we find that very great .
and let &apos;s also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so in ber@@ lin , we decided to build a hall where we could , kind of , map the atmosphere of the island in the scale of one in three very right .
that means we first decided to find out the world &apos;s largest bat@@ m in the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s naturally out of asia , in which case from japan .
and funny , it &apos;s been developed in the &apos; 7@@ 0s in b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , today , being developed , and then it was preser@@ ved to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very , very large battery .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt effect , and can bring this performance six hours long , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;re in like simul@@ ating technologies .
and then they set them up .
we also have one this same robot ag@@ gre@@ ft in the same size that it &apos;s written there , to actually put it into the hall , to actually see the complete dynamic behavior from this grid , so in the middle it looks like this , the one in the back is the big battery , here are all the cen@@ ders that we simul@@ ating the web with .
here we simu@@ late the entire trans@@ mission system , the kilometers of the c@@ able of c@@ ables to kind of map the vi@@ bra@@ tional behavior in the web .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also turn two hundred kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics on the grid .
here we see this again , again , again , again , again , the whole individual ag@@ gre@@ gate .
and what we &apos;ve been doing , since about twice six , was the middle of the middle , until today , two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -@@ 12 was almost everything that was built here between the single system on electr@@ on@@ ics to evol@@ ve at software , we did .
so we are not a bat@@ ter@@ er manufac@@ tur@@ er , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s just between the point of battery and the issue , and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to the battery , you can communicate to the grid , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that in this island , today , everything in this island is going to take advantage of problems that we &apos;ll get if we want to increase our compon@@ ent of rene@@ w@@ ables .
so this whole discussion , where it &apos;s moving , at the moment , energy , as we should go , for example , on the island , we have 16 to 30 percent ex@@ ogen@@ ent power , so we will bor@@ der the wind and the sun .
natural light then off@@ ers smart bri@@ an@@ e .
so smar@@ t bri@@ gs , a giant top@@ ic everywhere .
we can even start to integra@@ te electro@@ mo@@ bility in the island to question hor@@ rec@@ tly , because you can manage the load .
that is , if you &apos;re rene@@ w@@ able at 7@@ 0-@@ percent , you &apos;re not able to do it without any vehi@@ ps .
you can go through your smart bri@@ be , you can navi@@ gate the nets , yes , that should be also , certainly , to hear the amount , but you will never be able to es@@ cape the memory .
and that &apos;s what the message is like the message .
that &apos;s why a lot of people come there and look at it , because you can see what problem you get .
if we turn off the invasi@@ on , you don &apos;t have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass that causes a kind of in@@ er@@ ti@@ a on the net .
and our european inter@@ connect is basically made out of ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of big power sta@@ tions , where the wave everywhere turn around all over europe .
we look into this grid , see the 50 her@@ tz , and if it gets eight square com@@ ma nine , and if it &apos;s going to be nine square com@@ ma nine , we start putting a couple of squ@@ ars , then , again , we get up up again .
this is the system .
and , of course , that &apos;s incredibly at@@ tribu@@ te .
if you hold it down at random , it takes it now .
the spi@@ die reser@@ ves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net smo@@ il .
and in the time , you can respond to another one .
if you don &apos;t have that , these sp@@ inning mass , you have to replace it with efficiency electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ chemistry .
and we can turn out with this big battery two milli@@ seconds with two milli@@ seconds .
so you &apos;ve seen that there are enormous spee@@ ig@@ hn@@ ess .
and the message is , we have to give up these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we kind of spend our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so forth , if we want to achieve them all at all .
then we have to exp@@ and our mu@@ st-@@ brain capac@@ i@@ ties on the net .
mu@@ tch path just means , the power station runs with it to keep the frequ@@ ency .
yeah , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , to build the coal force stuff , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or ga@@ pes , because it doesn &apos;t work .
and we &apos;re just trying to acceler@@ ate that you can get rid of the capacity , the mu@@ ze@@ -@@ changing mode , by rein@@ vent@@ ing electro@@ chemical memor@@ ors into the grid .
now , there &apos;s a lot of studies that are very afraid .
and this kind of comes , people then come and look at our exam@@ ination , like our insu@@ stry .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of , how far can you take a piece of future there ?
and many discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years were similar than the discussion that i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years , for photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics .
so if you go , sh@@ ame , child play , we &apos;re getting it all apart , don &apos;t think about it .
we have 30 gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts today of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in germany .
this is ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ous .
and i just come to think that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical ves@@ sel@@ s around the world .
it &apos;s very simple , that &apos;s how it will happen .
there &apos;s so much to give argu@@ ments of con@@ tradi@@ ction and argu@@ ments .
the beautiful thing is , i &apos;ve been thinking so much now in the last two years , that scientists are looking on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million kinds of appli@@ cations , so google me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t-@@ battery now sti@@ cks to the ger@@ man network .
this is going to take place in the next apri@@ l .
so from that , you also remember that there &apos;s a change there , and just from that defen@@ se to yes , to the idea , a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able is right .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , it &apos;s like an au@@ ti@@ cking system .
so , in discus@@ sions always , in discus@@ sions , these cal@@ al people , they make au@@ tar@@ tics , they have a separate web that has nothing to do with our bon@@ ds and do nothing
the question , though , is quite simple if you make any independent from any fossil or ur@@ ani@@ a energy that is dri@@ ll@@ ed somewhere in the world and are being turned to them , then you are an island .
and then you just use what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind there , where they live .
and this is kind of a little bit of our vision of a meaning@@ ful energy supply , and i &apos;m also gr@@ ate@@ ful that you said , you use solar energy .
and so that &apos;s what we do , and we get in@@ so@@ ors , also the talk of pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , that you can again be a collective colle@@ ctive and you use solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encoura@@ ge you , in the sense that you can be quie@@ t a little bit crazy and also have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to work .
thank you very much .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n@@ ist of the los angeles times , he went through the streets one day at los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pathy , ra@@ u , hom@@ eless , who played on a vi@@ o@@ lin that had only two str@@ ou@@ ts .
many of you will know the story , because from ste@@ ves article , later , a book that was fil@@ med out , with robert dow@@ ney j@@ uni@@ or and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ony a@@ yers , the contr@@ ast that was studied at the ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ ter conser@@ v@@ atory and his promis@@ ing career was finished by his par@@ an@@ o@@ id schizophren@@ ia .
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , a new collapse , and 30 years later he lived as hom@@ eless in the streets of sc@@ id row at the center of sc@@ id row in los angeles .
i re@@ com@@ men@@ d all of you to read ste@@ ves book or to see the film , so you &apos;re not just understanding the wonderful connection that created between these two men , but also how the music motiv@@ ates these connections , but how it finally en@@ ables the instrument , if this pu@@ ff@@ le allows to get the mi@@ th@@ walk , na@@ than@@ iel away from the street .
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney mars called hei@@ ght .
he had just heard a dem@@ o of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth arb@@ is@@ ph@@ ia , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he was talking in a very tough and funny note about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers never got it to the baseball world series , and it all had because of the close pas@@ sage of the first po@@ o@@ lin in the last sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
we went to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which said na@@ than@@ iel was interested in me for in@@ keeping education .
i have to mention , na@@ than@@ iel left a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric sho@@ cks and th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , a trau@@ ma that followed him his whole life .
as a result , it &apos;s particularly pr@@ one to these schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases . these are sometimes so bad , and he rema@@ ins to go in the streets of sc@@ id row , always disappe@@ aring this hor@@ ror and the follo@@ wer quality of his own mind .
and in exactly this ri@@ ce stage , na@@ than@@ iel was when we started in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , at our first lec@@ ture in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , and he had lost this lun@@ man in his eyes , and he was completely destro@@ yed .
he talked about un@@ seen mon@@ es and smo@@ ke , and about how he wanted to po@@ ison him in the sleep .
i was afraid , not a lot of , but i was fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed that i could lose him to drop in a circum@@ stances , and that i could destro@@ y him with the relationship of the vi@@ o@@ lin when i started talking about narra@@ tives and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of the di@@ d@@ ac@@ ic g@@ inger department .
so i just started to play .
i was playing the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s vi@@ o@@ lin con@@ cer@@ t .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s eyes , he was running a complete change .
it was like he was underneath the influence of an invisible produ@@ z@@ i , a chemical reaction whose cat@@ aly@@ st was my play .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ d man@@ ish an@@ ger transl@@ ates into understanding , in a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and inti@@ ma@@ cy .
and like a mira@@ cle , he took his vi@@ o@@ lin , and started playing some cli@@ ps of vi@@ in@@ ine con@@ cer@@ ts , and then i asked me to finish it to end : men@@ del@@ s@@ son , t@@ br@@ i@@ ko@@ sk@@ sk@@ i , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
we started talking about music , starting from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , ul@@ ck@@ under and all the other bs , from bar@@ to@@ k k to es@@ a pe@@ k@@ ar sal@@ es .
and i realized that he was not just an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia knowledge about music , but also connected him a ti@@ ght personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i otherwise knew from my collea@@ gue in los angeles by los angeles .
by played music and talking about music , from this par@@ an@@ o@@ id , con@@ cre@@ te man who had yet moved through the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ vely , educ@@ ated , exc@@ ell@@ ent , in gu@@ il@@ li@@ ard trained musi@@ cians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for na@@ than@@ iel , music means si@@ an health .
because the music allows him to transform his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions with its imagination and creativity in something real to a very real shift .
and here he es@@ cap@@ es his wil@@ d-@@ breaking conditions .
i understood that that &apos;s what &apos;s the nature of art .
that &apos;s the reason we do music : so we do something that in all of us , deep inside ourselves , our emotions , through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , can make our creativity to reality .
and the reality of this instrument is going to reach us , and it moves , inspired and educ@@ ated us .
what na@@ than@@ iel did , he brought it back to a community of friends brought back to a community of friends .
the de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing power of music brought it back into a family of musi@@ cians who understood him and ste@@ pped his talent and went to his wake .
and i &apos;ll always keep music with na@@ than@@ iel , whether in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , hea@@ unded hall or sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me of why i became musi@@ cians .
thank you very much .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i want to play something that i did , which i sto@@ le the c@@ elli@@ st .
i hope you &apos;ll for@@ give me .
so i didn &apos;t know a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two hat@@ s .
this first , this was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
it was a beautiful fish , che@@ am@@ able , good con@@ den@@ si@@ ven@@ ess , a lat@@ ter on the men@@ k@@ map .
something like a fish .
even better , he was gro@@ wed in a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture for the highest standards of sustain@@ ability .
so you could feel like you &apos;re selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over a couple of months .
one day , the minister of the company called and asked , if i could , with an event on an event about the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
and i said , &quot; of course .
and here was a company trying to solve what became this un@@ impres@@ se problem for our che@@ fs , how do we keep fish on our men@@ top@@ es ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ hed the ocean as we beat the fore@@ sts of the fish .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ pro@@ grade the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tun@@ a , the heal@@ ing , the la@@ ke , the sin@@ k , the sin@@ k , they &apos;ve broken together .
there &apos;s almost nothing else left .
so it may be or we@@ ap@@ s a@@ qu@@ ak@@ ary , fis@@ und@@ ings , part of our future .
a lot of the argument against fish water pollu@@ tan@@ ts and the environment , most of them , are , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , take tun@@ a . a big dis@@ advantage .
he has a sal@@ age of 15 to one .
that means , 15 pounds of wild is needed to get a po@@ und tun@@ a .
not very ener@@ sely sustainable .
taste isn &apos;t ta@@ stes .
so finally , there was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to be fund@@ ing them .
the day before the event , i called the head of public emplo@@ y@@ ment for the company .
we &apos;re not going to call him .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far out of the sea so far that you wouldn &apos;t be pollu@@ ted to the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste is distribu@@ ted by our fish , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
and then , he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
and that food process@@ ing from 2.@@ 5 to 1 , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the business . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , that &apos;s great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one of what ? what fe@@ eding you ? &quot;
to say &quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put up .
and that night , i stood in bed , and i thought , what the hell is that a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask to ask .
well , i do@@ sted with a few people in the company , nobody could give me a de@@ cent answer , and until finally , i was tele@@ telling with the lo@@ ving bi@@ ologists .
we also don &apos;t call him kid@@ .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e , and some fish me@@ bes , and then he said chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ u@@ b ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , fri@@ gh@@ ting , skin , bone fl@@ our , cre@@ ars , gri@@ des , dri@@ ed and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; what a lot of our percent &apos;s worth chicken is chicken ? &quot;
in the assu@@ mption , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know , what &apos;s reli@@ able to fish on fish ? &quot;
there was a long scho@@ ster in the direc@@ tion , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i met about this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ cle@@ an@@ er and gu@@ d@@ man .
this is me even .
no , i actually am putting away from this fish , because , i swe@@ ar to god , that kno@@ cked fish after this interview to chicken .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way , the way you learn , the better you learn your fish , you lo@@ ck the fish .
i first e@@ aten him in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
a sig@@ ned journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it kind of s@@ wir@@ ded us .
he came on the table with a bright , almost stun@@ ning white color .
the che@@ f had co@@ ok him .
let &apos;s go twice .
now , ama@@ z@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ cious .
who can taste a fish so good after he got coo@@ ked ?
i don &apos;t can , but this guy can do it .
we &apos;re called him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he doesn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and it &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least in the way you and i rel@@ ate under .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
this is a fishing el@@ ev@@ ated in the south western corner in spa@@ in .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river gu@@ ad@@ el@@ it@@ vi@@ r .
until back in the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
they raised hor@@ k c@@ attle on what was basically we@@ t@@ lands .
and they did that by de@@ li@@ station the land .
they built this complicated out@@ come of chan@@ n@@ els , and they car@@ ried out water from the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that stuff that this was happening , not econom@@ ically .
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds for this place .
and in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company bought a span@@ ish company in 198@@ consciousness .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water rever@@ ses .
they &apos;ve literally institu@@ ted the le@@ ver .
instead of swi@@ mming the water out , they use the chan@@ n@@ els to pull the water back again .
they were fle@@ ating the chan@@ n@@ els .
they created a 1@@ 1,000 ac@@ r@@ es of fish -- bar@@ ely , se@@ a@@ lic , sh@@ ri@@ mp , a@@ al -- and they had mi@@ gu@@ el , and his company was the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destruction completely rever@@ se .
the farm is un@@ belie@@ vable .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they &apos;re star@@ ing out on the hori@@ zon that &apos;s a million miles away , and all you &apos;re seeing are covered chan@@ n@@ els , and these den@@ sity , vol@@ umin@@ ous mar@@ ch .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a piece of &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to k@@ is@@ ses . &quot;
okay ? so there were , and f@@ ed us through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i cle@@ an@@ ed and swi@@ mming , we have co@@ ok to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el kee@@ ps a biology lec@@ ture .
here he li@@ f@@ ts a rare gli@@ ta@@ stry .
now , he mentioned the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
and here , he &apos;s looking at a pattern of b@@ und@@ les that re@@ mind him to the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it turns out that mi@@ gu@@ el has spent the largest part of his career in the mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
i asked him how he got into a fish exper@@ t like this .
he said , &quot; fish ? &quot; i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t for rela@@ tions . &quot;
and then it goes and it goes and bur@@ ns into more approach@@ es of rare birds and al@@ ga@@ e and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t fa@@ ke me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community was un@@ pl@@ ly , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , my but i was in love .
and my head became we@@ ak about this en@@ co@@ ded piece of deli@@ cious fish that i had ever heard at the end of the day
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how is it that your fish ta@@ stes so well ? &quot;
and he showed on the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
what is the food en@@ dow@@ ment ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a vi@@ able system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , which is what the fish transp@@ l@@ ant .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-@@ wil@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned .
there &apos;s not a food .
ever bell heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
i went around this property later with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that appe@@ ars to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you negoti@@ ate ? &quot;
the moment was , a publi@@ sh@@ er has cla@@ im@@ ed a broad@@ stream change .
and we surro@@ unded the corner , and we provi@@ ded ourselves of the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of white fl@@ amin@@ gos , a literally p@@ is@@ k car@@ pet the eye is so far the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s succe@@ eding , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your tu@@ bes , p@@ ink .
they su@@ ck . &quot;
di@@ vor@@ ce ? i was completely conf@@ used .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t you mu@@ de your fish ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; yes , &quot;
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish af@@ rop@@ es to the birds .
now , last year on this site , 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s today the biggest , and one of the most important private laws of the bird reser@@ ves all over europe .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is not the last thing to do the last thing you want to have on a fish ? &quot;
he sha@@ g@@ ged his head , no .
he said , &quot; we build exc@@ ell@@ ence , not inten@@ sive .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp fe@@ ats the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
so the ro@@ er the better is the stuff the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think about this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that takes their success on the health of their predat@@ ors .
it &apos;s a fish up , but it also got a bird reser@@ vation .
oh , by the way , this fl@@ amin@@ gos should not even be there in front of you
they were bre@@ eding in a city of 2@@ 40 miles , where the surface of the soil is better for the nest .
you fly 2,@@ 40 miles every morning to the farm .
and they fly 2@@ 40 miles each night .
they do it because they can follow the land@@ ed white line on the high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 .
seriously , .
i had pres@@ ented a kind of a harvard degree of penguins , so i looked mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , fly to the farm 2@@ 40 miles to the farm , and fly it down to 2@@ 40 miles at night ?
do that do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me like i &apos;d just quot@@ ed a song of whit@@ ney hou@@ ston .
he said , &quot; no . you &apos;re doing it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fis@@ her@@ y , the deli@@ cious was , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like them brow@@ sed . i don &apos;t like them cr@@ ying .
it &apos;s this clever , un@@ can@@ ned fla@@ vor .
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
and yet , when i tried them in south spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t push it from fish in southern spa@@ in at all .
she ta@@ sted swe@@ et and po@@ per , as if you took a bi@@ te from the ocean .
and i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he was kid@@ ding .
he said , &quot; the skin appe@@ ars like a spon@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last demo@@ way before something comes into the body .
she has evolved throughout evolution to su@@ ck un@@ sen@@ su@@ s . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any un@@ reli@@ ance . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that descri@@ bes your success on success is going to success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no own fla@@ pes is im@@ migr@@ ant , because the water flo@@ ws through this farm , because the water flo@@ ws through this farm of gu@@ ad@@ al@@ it@@ vi@@ r .
it &apos;s a river that leads all things that are led , from those ra@@ vers today to lead them , chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , waste of p@@ est consu@@ l@@ tan@@ cy .
and then when it f@@ ought through the system , and that disappe@@ ars , the water is clean than how it comes out .
the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that resol@@ ves their success in the health of their predat@@ ors , but a farm that is literally a water ti@@ cket plant , and not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water flo@@ ws out , it &apos;s fall@@ ing in the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and i want to do that , because this love story , like roman@@ tic , is also poin@@ ting .
you might say that you &apos;re a pres@@ cri@@ ption for the future of good food , whether we talk about bar@@ es or meat c@@ on@@ es .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where food actually taste well .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we are not a reali@@ stic , we &apos;re enjo@@ ying . we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love market@@ er markets . we love small family process@@ ing . we talk about local food . we eat bi@@ o .
and if you cla@@ im that these are things that the future security is belie@@ ving , someone gets up somewhere , and says , &quot; hey guys , i love p@@ ke fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how will they feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
is i , you can be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just fe@@ eding the world .
a billion people are going to star@@ ve today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of cr@@ as@@ ser ine@@ quali@@ ties in the distribution , not the over@@ all production .
now , i don &apos;t like that question because it has been the lo@@ gic of our food system for the last 50 years .
so tra@@ yers of flo@@ wer@@ ing grain , s@@ wis@@ s bat to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time the agri@@ cultural industry has just said , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the matter . it was the right measure . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a body in down@@ po@@ und , a craft that redu@@ ces very fast environmental capital that allows exactly these services .
this is not an industry , and it &apos;s not an agriculture .
our cor@@ ne@@ f cham@@ ber is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of the re@@ view , but because of the limit@@ ation of resources .
not through the lat@@ est pon@@ d@@ lock and tra@@ c@@ tor@@ er , but ferti@@ le land , not by pu@@ mp , but ferti@@ le land , not by pu@@ mp , but by fres@@ ine water , not by the forest sa@@ ws , but through fore@@ sts , not by fishing bo@@ ats and we@@ ats , but through fish in the sea .
you want to be fe@@ eding the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
to do that , you don &apos;t look at the agri@@ cultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
health , chemistry and machines are in o@@ ven@@ an , and it never has a really good thing to eat for food .
let &apos;s look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model instead .
this is that that rec@@ its on two billion years of emplo@@ y@@ ment .
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
businesses that don &apos;t have the worl@@ ds for themselves , are jobs that re@@ store instead of re@@ stor@@ ing , agriculture that creates exc@@ it@@ ence rather than only inten@@ se , farmers who are not just profession@@ als , but exper@@ ti@@ ers for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better che@@ f than i am ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be deli@@ cious .
thank you .
if i want to share with you today , it &apos;s that the whole data of data that we consu@@ me is bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , i want you to think about how we can use information so that we can use information so that there is patterns , and we recognize trends so that the otherwise would not have been visible to see .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical ster@@ ic@@ m after age .
the program that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t and what i can do with pi@@ bet , that i can film after a particular law cause , we say acci@@ dents .
and at the moment , i see a different pattern that makes itself .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of this , people are the most active , and they &apos;re at the most part of them over here .
we can go out one step further , and then we re-@@ organi@@ ze the data , and we see that cy@@ cles and cancer are the usual sus@@ pe@@ cts , but not everyone .
so if we go on and concerned after age , say 40 years or yo@@ unger , we see that acci@@ dents are even the leading thing that people should worry about .
and he fin@@ ds to that , who turns on to know that this is especially in men
so you can see that the look at information and data in this way remin@@ ds very much on swi@@ mming in a life@@ -@@ to-@@ life piece of information .
and if we can do that for bre@@ a@@ w data , why not even do that for content ?
so what we have here is the cover of every single spor@@ ting illusion , each of which have ever been prin@@ ted .
it &apos;s all over here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my lec@@ ture in your rooms .
with pi@@ bet , you can sub@@ mit into a decade .
you can immer@@ se into a certain year .
you can fli@@ p right to a certain ex@@ am .
if i look here , i look at the ath@@ le@@ tes that appear in this po@@ cket and spor@@ ts species .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong dis@@ order , so i click here where all the expen@@ ses tell me that lan@@ ce arm@@ strong &apos;s argu@@ ing .
now , if i want to get a bigger over@@ view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the theme of bi@@ ke ? &quot;
so i go back to step and i &apos;ll look at the perspective .
now i &apos;m looking at gre@@ g le@@ mond .
and so you get an idea of that , that if you zo@@ om in on this kind of information , you open , more stre@@ e@@ ded , zo@@ om , zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t just measure or num@@ b .
you do something that actually is a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it &apos;s changing the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit further with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we took every single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ d , and we re@@ duced it to a little sum@@ mary .
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a short over@@ come and a symbol of the area that it comes from .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the popular english pe@@ di@@ dat@@ es .
but even in this limit@@ ing way , we can do a lot of things .
now , we get a sense of the subje@@ cts of the subje@@ cts that are present on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government &quot; government . &quot;
now , after i &apos;ve cho@@ sen to call the government that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ gr@@ at@@ ories , which is the most popular magazine , which is the most popular magazine &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is an insi@@ ght that doesn &apos;t put it in a single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ d .
it &apos;s just recogni@@ zing if you go back and look at all of the stuff .
thinking about a particular one of these comp@@ ales , i can go into the theme of time magazine people of the year , and see everybody together .
now , if i look at all these individuals , i realize that the majority of these government offi@@ ci@@ als are . some come from science . some , no less , come from economy . here &apos;s my bo@@ ss , and one comes out of the music real@@ m .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
so we can jump now and take a look at all the ted prize w@@ its .
you can see , we are sur@@ fing the web for the first time , as if it &apos;s really a network , not just from side to side , but much more abstra@@ ct .
and so i want to show you something else that might be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
pi@@ vo@@ t , this ap@@ p -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can look at web pages -- and we bring this zo@@ om@@ -@@ technology to every single website like this .
so , i can go back and go back to a specific se@@ gment to a specific se@@ gment .
and this is important , because you just look at web sites in this way , to look at the whole internet course in the same way .
so in my own degree , i can zo@@ om in on a particular time field .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demon@@ stration i &apos;ve held up to here .
and i can sort of bring everything i &apos;ve seen today , get back again .
and , so , when i step back a step , and look at everything , i can re@@ ar@@ range my course , maybe after my search past , here , i &apos;m looking at &quot; ne@@ po@@ ti@@ cally , &quot; here by bing , or here to live lab@@ s pi@@ ker .
and from here , i can go into the side and call it back up .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again and again , and every time it makes the whole picture bigger than the sum of the dat@@ ables .
right now in this world , we think that data is a cur@@ ve .
we &apos;re talking about the cur@@ ve of information shif@@ ting .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; let &apos;s sell in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and turn the internet on its head , so instead of going from one to the other , we start to be able to go from a lot of things to a lot of things , and to see patterns that otherwise rema@@ ined hidden hidden ?
if we can do that , then this one fine foot@@ print , maybe a new source of sensor@@ y information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge out of it .
and if we know knowledge , then maybe we can pull wisdom out of it .
i &apos;ll stop with that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a pra@@ y por@@ tion of science fi@@ ction .
in my school , i went to school to school , every day an hour a rou@@ te .
and my nose always stuck in a book , a science fi@@ ction book that brought my mind to other worl@@ ds , and in story@@ gi@@ cally , my mind was satis@@ fying my deep in me , in@@ sa@@ gi@@ ous curi@@ osity .
this curi@@ osity also repor@@ ted that when i was not in school , through the forest of the forest , and travel@@ ed , and &quot; sam@@ ples , &quot; fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ cks and bu@@ mp@@ s and po@@ cket water , everything took home and looked under the microscop@@ e .
i &apos;ve been completely discipl@@ ined , you know .
it always was about trying to understand the world and turning out the boundar@@ ies of what could happen .
and my love of science fi@@ ction seemed to mirror in my neighborhood , because back in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ w to the moon and explor@@ ed the deep se@@ as .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living room with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never could have imag@@ ined .
now , that probably adap@@ ted well to that science fi@@ ction issue .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it wasn &apos;t video games nor these over@@ la@@ pers with computer gener@@ es , the whole picture of all the ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create the pain@@ t@@ ings in my head .
and we all had to use that then . when we treated a book as kids , we took the descri@@ ption of the auth@@ or , and we proje@@ cted it on the screen in our minds .
my response to that was to draw and draw ali@@ ens , ali@@ ens , alien worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ ec@@ ts and all that kind of thing
i was caught all over the class of the teacher , like i hi@@ d , hi@@ ding behind text@@ book , painting .
creativity had to go out kind of out .
and something interesting happened : what fascin@@ ated me about jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ dy &apos;s shows , the idea of one of us was the idea of one of us completely un@@ known world on our planet itself .
i &apos;m sure i would never achieve an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p . that seemed to me quite un@@ likely .
but here was a world that i actually could es@@ cape , here on earth , and it was as fascinating and ex@@ o@@ tic as all of the things that i &apos;ve always imag@@ ined when i read these books .
so , i decided when i was 15 to be di@@ et@@ able .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , a hundre@@ d-@@ mile distance from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
but i wasn &apos;t allowed to dis@@ coura@@ ge from that .
i en@@ coura@@ ted my father until he finally made a di@@ che school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right on the other side of the bor@@ der , where we lived .
i made my di@@ ve in a pool of y@@ m@@ ca in the middle of the winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
the ocean but , a real ocean , i got to the face two years later , when we went to california .
since , in the 40 years that i &apos;ve been given , i &apos;ve spent about 3@@ 0,000 hours under@@ water , 500 hours of it in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so rich in a fascinating life , as we can really imagine it .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know any boundar@@ ies , unlike our own sound imag@@ in@@ ity .
until today , i feel stron@@ g@@ ly a@@ we of what i see on my di@@ ve .
and my love to the ocean is holding with the same inten@@ sity like bee@@ h and ever .
so , when i looked at a prof@@ it@@ er , as an adult , it was film@@ making .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner stories to tell stories , with my need , to create images .
as a child , i was always drawing com@@ ic books and so forth .
so movies were the path of bringing images and stories and stories together . the fit together .
of course , the stories i looked at from the sci@@ en@@ ci@@ ction section : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
so in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was able to connect my pre@@ ference for the under@@ water world , and to bridge with the film@@ making .
so , basically my two passi@@ ons are conver@@ ted .
one of the interesting things happened in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s how we had to create a kind of liquid water -- we would win on computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
what came out was the first computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated soft@@ -@@ sur@@ v character that ever was seen in a movie .
the film had no money , frank@@ ly , it was just appe@@ ared to be his production cost , but i realized something amazing : the audience in the world was like h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zing the magic that was happening .
according to ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law , fam@@ ously , advanced technology and magic can no longer dist@@ ingu@@ ish from each other .
so , you saw something ma@@ gical .
and i discovered that really exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that has to be involved in the movie . &quot;
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next movie , far more .
together with atta@@ ch@@ ment , we created the guy from liquid metal there . the success was on how to get this effect .
and it worked . again , we had a little magic , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve already played a little bit more money with the film .
so , from these two facts , a whole new world has reach@@ ed a whole new world of making a whole new world of film
so i started a company together with my good friend , ken win@@ ston , who was the best ma@@ ke up@@ and and cre@@ at@@ ing designer , and it was called digital do@@ main .
the basic idea of this company was to ski@@ p the phase of audi@@ o with visual pr@@ inter@@ s , etc . , and start to start with digital production .
so , we did , and we managed to get a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
but in the mid@@ - &apos; 9@@ 0s , we realized that we were in the cre@@ at@@ u@@ re-@@ and piano design -- which we actually started to fo@@ unded the company -- to slowly come to slowly arri@@
i had written this piece of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; that should look at the measure of visual effects and computer effects across all new al@@ ds , with reali@@ stic human effects that were made by c@@ g , and the main characters should be all c@@ g . and the world should be all c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g .
but the bar stru@@ ck back very much , and the people in my company told me that we were not pre@@ den@@ red yet to create that .
so i trans@@ formed this , and i made this other film about the big ship that goes on .
the film studio i sold this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t on a ship , &quot; it became a love film epi@@ ic sc@@ ales , a passionate movie .
but in secret , i really wanted to drop down to the real w@@ tan@@ om@@ ic of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know , but it didn
but i convinced them , i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the w@@ ck . we &apos;re going to filter the real w@@ ass .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
this is hu@@ gely important . it &apos;s a good treat for marketing . &quot;
and i ur@@ ged them to fund an expedi@@ tion .
sounds crazy . but this is what goes back again that your imagination can create reality .
we then created a reality six months later a reality that i found in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ boat , four kilometers away from the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , and looked at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a bu@@ ll@@ eye .
this was not a movie , no h@@ d , that was real .
so , that really ble@@ w me up .
and prepar@@ ation to that was enor@@ m@@ ously , we had to have c@@ ameras and cloud and cloud and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these deep@@ -@@ sea sites , in a space mission .
well , they were also highly technologi@@ cal and allowed to take ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se planning .
you go into these cap@@ su@@ les , you dra@@ g into these dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environments , where there &apos;s no hope on res@@ cu@@ e , if you don &apos;t create it yourself yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like i &apos;m in a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was absolutely obs@@ essed with explor@@ ing the deep se@@ as .
but anyway , the part that has to do with curi@@ osity and science . it was all . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ tion . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood to my fellow .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature that we could design for then a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside of the window .
some of the following expedi@@ tions i &apos;ve seen creatures in ther@@ mal@@ e@@ sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that have never seen before , and who the science at the time when we saw them did not have any words at the time .
so , that &apos;s what changed me right , and i wanted to do more .
and so i came up with a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want my time to put a film@@ maker in hollywood on ice , and be going for a very ful@@ l-@@ time resear@@ cher . &quot;
and then we started to &quot; bis@@ mar@@ ck , &quot; and we explor@@ ed them with robo@@ tic sophisti@@ cations .
we went back to the w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
we took little robots that we built that dist@@ ingu@@ ished a fi@@ ber@@ glass c@@ able .
our inten@@ tion was to sin@@ k in and see the inside of the ship , which never had been done before .
no one ever had to study the inside of the le@@ ck . you didn &apos;t have any resources for it . so we designed the technology .
well , here i am , on the de@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and i see plan@@ s that are quite similar to this boo@@ k@@ stor@@ es , and where i know that once the band was playing there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little robo@@ tic thing through the radio of the ship .
by definition , i &apos;m actually just , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physi@@ cally in the ship of the ti@@ tan@@ ic of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
that was the most sur@@ real form of a d@@ é@@ j@@ em vi@@ u that i had ever experienced , because before i cover around a corner , i always knew what would come up in the light c@@ ill of the vehicle , because i did have travel@@ ed on film sum@@ set when we turned the film .
and the rou@@ te was an accu@@ rate copy of the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
so this was a rather aw@@ k@@ ward experience .
and she was aware of me seeing this tele@@ pres@@ ence of this tele@@ pres@@ ence , that you can use robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars , and so do your consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really tremend@@ ously profound .
and perhaps a little bit about what may happen in a few decades , when you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to explore something or do other things in all different post-@@ entreprene@@ os for explor@@ ing or doing other things in all sorts of post-@@ entrepr@@ os that i can think of as a science fi@@ ction .
so after these expedi@@ tions , we started to learn what we were seeing down there , really valu@@ ing , for example , these deep marine open@@ ings , where we saw these incredible animals . these are sort of ali@@ ens , but here &apos;s where it comes on earth .
they are living with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
it doesn &apos;t exist in one of the sun@@ light systems , how we do it .
and this is what you see animals right next to a 500 degree centi@@ grade , &quot; that they can survive there .
while at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , and it was again the science fi@@ ction impact from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the space who &apos;s interested in the space , and who have to do with nasa in the nasa min@@ d@@ set , sit down and plan real space mis@@ sions . they drive to russi@@ a , through the mission of the bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ co@@ l , all the way up and down , fly to the global space station and take our 3d camera shel@@ ters .
so this was fascinating .
but in the end , it jum@@ ped out that i took space scientists down to the deep sea .
i took them in and off them to the world on there : astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ a-@@ scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they were looking around , and they could test up , and test instru@@ ments and so on .
we twi@@ sted docum@@ ent@@ ary repor@@ ts , but we actually did science , frank@@ ly , space science .
so the circle between my existence as science fi@@ ction was te@@ sted as a science fi@@ ction , then as a child , and the imple@@ ment@@ ation in reality .
and during the course of that discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i certainly think that you can also take a direc@@ tor , have to be a leader like a ship or something like a ship .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i came up with these expedi@@ tions .
because at one point , i had to say , &quot; well , what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to get out ? &quot;
these sil@@ red videos don &apos;t give us money .
we &apos;re currently going to play in the cost of manufacturing . we &apos;re not a lan@@ ce .
everybody thinks i was walking out between ti@@ tan@@ ic and a@@ vat@@ ar , and i would have been out of the ni@@ p@@ ble somewhere somewhere on a to@@ we@@ l .
i &apos;ve made all these films , these docum@@ ent@@ aries films , for a very small audience .
no rest , no hon@@ est , no money . what do you just do ?
you &apos;re going to do it about the job , to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the challen@@ ging environment that you have . you make it the size of the discovery , and because of the curious connection that comes from people when a small group of people forming a team .
because we &apos;ve made all this working with only 10 to 12 people that worked un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted for years , sometimes we were two to three months behind each other on la@@ ke .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the a@@ version that you have in front of each other , because you have performan@@ ced a task that you can &apos;t explain to any other .
when you come back to the country and say , &quot; we &apos;ve had to do it , the fi@@ ber glass , the wr@@ ath of the brilli@@ ance , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of human power , when you work on the ocean , &quot; you can &apos;t explain that others . it &apos;s like you can &apos;t explain it . it &apos;s like poli@@ ce@@ men or soldiers who have worked somewhere together and know that they can never explain somebody .
there is a connection , a fe@@ asi@@ bility of each other .
so when i got back to make my next film &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership style , that you respect your team and you were responsible in the proce@@ d@@ ance to respect it .
that became really changed the dynam@@ ics .
so , there i was with a little team on un@@ known ter@@ rain , and we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; with a new techni@@ que that had been not there before .
it &apos;s incredibly exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we were getting to a real family time for a four@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years .
so my way of making films changed , is completely .
there were people who said we had really worked these oceans , and we were really well fund@@ ing these oceans and transpor@@ ting the planet p@@ and@@ or@@ a .
for me , it was more of a vi@@ ral way to do my job , the actual process that changed the out@@ come .
so , what can we conclu@@ de from all that ?
so what asi@@ des have we learned ?
i think first that curi@@ osity is curi@@ tat@@ ed .
it &apos;s the most powerful human fe@@ ature .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
and the wisdom of your team is more important than all the l@@ or@@ es of the world .
i get young film@@ makers who say , &quot; give me a gr@@ ence like this , &quot; like i can do something like this .
and i say , &quot; limit@@ s you without yourself .
they have others for you . don &apos;t you , don &apos;t bet yourself versus yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; fail@@ ing is not alternative . &quot;
but in art , and explor@@ ing an alternative , we have to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a trust supply there .
no important elimin@@ ation that requi@@ red innovation was ever accep@@ ted without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you on the path . fail@@ ing is an alternative , fear , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this may be surprising , because my ful@@ l-@@ time job in the foundation basically revol@@ ts around vac@@ cin@@ es and se@@ at@@ ings to provide the things that we inv@@ ent and contribu@@ te to to the poor@@ est two billion billion billion .
but energy and climate are incredibly important for these people , pre@@ cis@@ ely more important than any other on the planet .
air de@@ light means that their le@@ ats will not grow for many years . it &apos;s too much rain or too little rain . the things are going to change the way that they can &apos;t keep their fra@@ gi@@ le environment .
that kill@@ s star@@ vation . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to sac@@ so@@ fi@@ ce .
so , climate change is going to be horri@@ ble for you .
also , energy state is very important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price from one thing , poverty would be energy at least more effective in most more effective .
well , the energy gen@@ ti@@ um is be@@ aten over time
in fact , the continu@@ ity society is gro@@ unded for energy progress .
the co@@ her@@ ent evolution is moving the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a ra@@ pid case in electrical risk , and so we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , climate condi@@ tion@@ ors , we can make modern materials and so many things do .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price -- let &apos;s hit a new bar@@ rier , and that bar@@ rier depen@@ ds with co2 .
co2 wa@@ kes the planet , and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually quite clear .
it puts the hundreds of co2 that leads to temperature increasing , and these temperature increase has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect consequences that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to ada@@ pt to change , and therefore that &apos;s how whole systems collapse .
now , the ex@@ act context between a carbon rise increase , and that &apos;s where the resul@@ ting temperature shift , and where their addi@@ tional consequences are , there are some counter@@ -@@ in@@ stra@@ ctions , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ir@@ ration@@ y about how bad those will be going , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
so i asked the top scientist a bunch of times , &quot; do we really need to go down to zero ?
doesn &apos;t half a quar@@ ter or a quar@@ ter ? &quot;
and the answer is : until we get near zero , the temperature will continue to acceler@@ ate .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from say , we have a three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ foot tru@@ ck that has to put under a three-@@ meter stro@@ ke , and you can get that off there , and then you can slide it underneath it .
this has to go down right down there , to zero .
well , we &apos;re laun@@ ching a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american one about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we need to create change that will pull this down to zero .
it &apos;s been materi@@ ally up .
only different economic changes have been affec@@ ting it , and we need to move from rapi@@ dly to reduce the increase , and a redu@@ ction down to zero .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors . a little bit multi@@ pli@@ cation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to bring down zero , from the number of people , from the service that consu@@ mes every human on average , the average energy for any service and the co2 that is em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit .
so let &apos;s look at every factor , and let &apos;s think about how we get that to zero .
probably one of those numbers has to get very close to zero .
now that &apos;s the basic al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take it through .
first , we have the popu@@ lations .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live .
and it &apos;s leading to nine billion . they &apos;re moving to 9 billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care health care agen@@ cies , we might be able to get that 10 percent to 15 percent , but right now , we see a slo@@ pe by 1.@@ 3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that inclu@@ des everything , the food that we eat , clo@@ th@@ es , tv , he@@ ating .
these are very good things and in@@ fusion redu@@ ction is to make these services almost univer@@ s@@ ally available on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is ris@@ ing .
in the rich world , in the upp@@ er billion , we might be able to make and benefit less , but on average , that number will reach every year , and on average , that number will reach every year , the number of services that are appropriate to each person .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there home at home so you can read the home@@ work ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and they check their scho@@ ol@@ work under the street .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there are good news at all .
we have something that doesn &apos;t up on it .
because of different practic@@ es in the light sector , through other er@@ l@@ yp@@ es , through new metho@@ ds in houses , there are lots of services that have the energy quality of some services , are cut by 90 percent .
in other services , like the making of ferti@@ li@@ z@@ ers , 10@@ 5 cent@@ re : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- it shows ; it suggests ; 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air traffic or air traffic , the circu@@ it of impro@@ v@@ ements is a lot smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , maybe we get a redu@@ ction by a factor of three , or maybe even a factor of six .
but the first three fac@@ tors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to perhaps the most accu@@ rate 13 tons , and that &apos;s just not enough !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit .
it rais@@ es the question whether you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufac@@ ture of manufacturing for electricity today em@@ powered co2 , except rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do in a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy appe@@ ar@@ ance .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the personal p@@ c is a mira@@ cle .
the internet and the services is a mira@@ cle .
people here contribu@@ te to the activi@@ ties of many of these tex@@ ts .
so , normally , there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a particular date .
usually you just stand straight and some others get , some don &apos;t .
but in this case , we need to be full of gas and a mira@@ cle in very short time .
now , i wonder@@ ed , how can i really get this going to ?
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that co@@ vers the idea of people here ?
and i remem@@ ber@@ ed myself last year when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people like that .
the idea of them becomes really tan@@ gi@@ ble , you know that there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
for energy , this was what i sett@@ led on .
i decided that the ligh@@ ting of fire@@ flies would be my this year-old contribu@@ tion to the environment .
so here are some natural holes of light .
appreci@@ ated me that they don &apos;t bi@@ te . in fact , they &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
well , there are all sorts of play solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t take a lot .
we need solutions , either one or many of them that have an uni@@ qu@@ ely abstra@@ ction and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able reli@@ ability , and even though there are lots of direc@@ tions that people are looking for for , i really only see five that can afford these big dem@@ ands .
i &apos;ve cho@@ sen , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
now , i might expect a moder@@ ate optimi@@ tion , and if you &apos;ll afford better than i expect , that would be great than i expect , but my core stat@@ ement here is that we have to work on all the five working , and we can &apos;t give up because everybody has significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at this burning fossil fu@@ els , sel@@ ec@@ ting from either coal or natural gas .
what you need to do there might seem simple seems , but that &apos;s it . you have to , you don &apos;t have to catch all the co2 that comes after the ch@@ ore in the ch@@ im@@ f , catch away with pressure , and then somewhere that will stay there .
there are a few pil@@ es that are creating this on a 60 percent , 80 percent standards , but it &apos;s getting 100 percent very hard . and to get it to 100 percent is very hard . but the biggest problem here is the cham@@ pi@@ time of the co2 , but the biggest problem here is the bor@@ der question .
who is going to en@@ sure it ?
who can guar@@ an@@ tee , what many literally are &#93; greater than any billions of waste than any kind of waste you can imagine from any of the nuclear things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ mes .
so this is a tough ne@@ ck .
next one : nuclear energy .
also , they have three big problems , and the cost , especially in highly resour@@ ced countries are high , the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human interaction , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the tr@@ ash ?
because it &apos;s not very big though , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
so , three very hard problems that may be solu@@ ble , and which you should work on this .
i &apos;ve sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed the last three of the five .
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ ables of rene@@ w@@ ables , as they often are .
and they also have -- while it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some slo@@ ps .
one is the energy im@@ pac@@ ts that produce these technologies dra@@ matically lower than power plants .
this is the power ground , you &apos;re talking about a lot of square kilometers , 1,000 times more surface than a normal power plant .
and also , these sources depen@@ ds inter@@ rup@@ tions .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all the day , but it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t always turn all the time .
so , you have to , if you &apos;re depen@@ dent on these sources , have a way , the energy , the energy even when it &apos;s not available available .
so there &apos;s great price challenges . there &apos;s challenges of trans@@ mission . if we say that , for example , the source source outside the country is , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you also have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where different comes from
and there &apos;s the stor@@ age problem .
and in order to show the dimension , i have all kinds of bat@@ ter@@ ies that are made , looking at this for cars , computers , cell phones , flas@@ h@@ lights , for everything . and this is what i have with the amount of electr@@ onic energy that &apos;s using the world , and i found that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies that we produce now could save less than 10 minutes of the sum of the sum .
so we need a big break@@ through here , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the similar events at the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these intern@@ al sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to take care of it by 100 percent , you need an incredible mira@@ cle battery .
now , where we &apos;re going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need are a lot of companies to work on it . hundreds of them .
in every five parts of these five sur@@ faces , we need at least 100 people .
by many , you will say , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think there are a lot of people here at ted group that already have been invest@@ ed there .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among other companies , one named es@@ ol@@ ar has the great solar ther@@ mal@@ mal@@ technologies .
vin@@ berg k@@ ho@@ s@@ lin has invest@@ ed in do@@ zens companies who do good things and have interesting opportunities , and i try to support this .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old , and i &apos;m fund@@ ing a company who , maybe surpris@@ ingly , follow the nuclear approach .
there are a lot of innovation in the nuclear section ; mod@@ ular , liquid .
the process has stopped in this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concep@@ ts change around .
the ter@@ ra@@ tional concept , if you were part of ur@@ ans , the one percent , the one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , that u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never fully simu@@ late whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern super@@ computer , you can simu@@ late it , and see that yes . with the right amount of materials , it looks like it &apos;s func@@ tion@@ ing .
and because you burn this 99 percent , the cost profi@@ le is a lot better .
in fact , you burn the g@@ arb@@ age , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s waste as a source of fuel .
rather than break through your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
ur@@ ani@@ um is consum@@ ed gradu@@ ally , a little bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of a colum@@ n , often as &quot; migr@@ ant wave re@@ actor . &quot;
this really is the fu@@ r problem .
this is a picture of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s bur@@ ned today , so it &apos;s so spre@@ at@@ en@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um .
the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you color@@ er more water , and you just paint , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet to the rest of the planet
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of a lot of hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we &apos;re supposed to measure our success .
what should our artificial appe@@ ar@@ ance look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to get to , and then we talk about the conversation .
a lot of a percent redu@@ ction is about 80 percent redu@@ ction to 20@@
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
the rest of all 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , but still some agriculture , hopefully , is going to be wh@@ ale stro@@ kes and c@@ ement to then at the time .
so , to completely achieve this 80 percent , the developed states , including countries like china , completely transform their electricity generation .
the other note would tell whether we &apos;re taking the zer@@ o-@@ dollar emissions , whether it &apos;s built in all the developed world , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s extremely important .
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this idea .
if we go back from there , what should the 20@@ 20 ac@@ r@@ ist look like ?
it should con@@ tain the two elements again .
we should use the speci@@ fication action to bring redu@@ ction on the path . the less we em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze , the lower it will be the carbon sum and also the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things that we &apos;re companies that don &apos;t lead all the way to the great measu@@ re@@ ments , just iden@@ ght , or even slightly less important as the other that is the sil@@ ence of innovation for this break@@ through .
these head@@ lines have to follow full gas , and we can measure that : in business numbers , in spor@@ ting technologies and regu@@ lation changes .
there are a lot of great books about this top@@ ic .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ y &apos;s &quot; sustainable energy is the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a frame@@ work where this can be discus@@ sed , because we need support of all the pages .
there are a lot of things that need to come together .
so that &apos;s a wish .
a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
if you give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could sele@@ ct the president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is hal@@ f-@@ pl@@ ated energy avail@@ age without co2 . that &apos;s what i want to do . i want to pay that wish .
this one has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the sei@@ zur@@ e will be terrible and shor@@ t-@@ term people are terrible between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich dep@@ th , and almost all of the lives of those two are going to be very bad .
so , what do we need to do ?
what are i doing for action ?
we have to use for more research fun@@ ds .
if countries make a cop@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen in places like cop@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should disc@@ uss this innovation strategy , and they would be sho@@ cked by the ridi@@ cul@@ ous attra@@ ctions that are advan@@ ced for these innovative approach@@ es .
we need market drive , co2 ta@@ xes , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; fac@@ tors , something that creates a price signal .
we have to spread the message .
we need to have dialo@@ gue and more complete and also the things that government will be taken from government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ ci@@ ty -- first , can you give us an idea of the order of aug@@ ment@@ ation of this investment ?
bill gates : so to do this simulation on a super@@ computer , to get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we need only a few 10 . and even if we test our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure it &apos;s reas@@ on@@ able , you &apos;re only in the tens of hundred million .
the hard step is building the first respon@@ sor of the first re@@ actor to find another billion billion , the regul@@ ari@@ os and the place that actually create the first of them .
once the first thing is done , if it pas@@ ses like pres@@ ent@@ y , it &apos;s really easy , because the economic , the energy , is so different than nuclear energy as we know it .
to understand that right , that does mean deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical cu@@ be of nuclear fu@@ els , that used ur@@ ans , and then the process is beginning to go down and work down ?
b@@ g : right . so today you have to re@@ gre@@ t the re@@ actor , so there are a lot of people and a lot of contro@@ ls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and put things in it or out of it . it &apos;s not good
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think of a colum@@ n -- that you &apos;re bu@@ ried without all the intri@@ c@@ ality .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s burning for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear re@@ actor that off@@ ers itself a solution to the g@@ arb@@ age .
b@@ g : yeah . now what happens to the waste : you can sit it sitting -- there &apos;s a lot less g@@ arb@@ age with this techni@@ que -- you take it and you put it in the next re@@ actor and you burn it .
and we &apos;re starting , by taking the g@@ arb@@ age that already exists , that are in these re@@ fri@@ tors or dr@@ in contain@@ ers in the re@@ ac@@ tors . this is our step fuel .
so this re@@ ac@@ tors is a problem of what we &apos;re pus@@ hing in , and what we &apos;re pus@@ hing in , the wa@@ g@@ gets will dra@@ matically reduce the tr@@ ash during this process .
but as they talked to various people in the world about these possibilities , they &apos;ve been talking
where is the greatest interest of this really to do this ?
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t set up a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things for everything called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the corpo@@ rate goods in russi@@ a , india , china -- i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve met the energy agen@@ cy and talked about how this is about energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese has done something in the direction .
this is a vari@@ ant of one thing that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor , and some countries built this , so everyone who has trans@@ formed a fast re@@ actor , a can@@ di@@ date for our first .
in your imagination , ti@@ mel@@ ine and prob@@ ability is something like this to really live in life ?
b@@ g : now we need one of these sc@@ al@@ able , carb@@ on-@@ gener@@ ating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent , and then 20 years to use .
this is sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environmental models have demon@@ strated us that we need to address .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ tic power , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , you might think , easily .
and fortunately , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds of them , who , as well as their posi@@ tions work , the fund@@ ing for their pil@@ ots , can offer it to it .
and it would be the best if it &apos;s creating multiple , because you could use a mix@@ ture .
anyway , we don &apos;t need a solution .
how about the great range of break@@ through@@ s , is this the biggest you know ?
b@@ g : a trans@@ se@@ min@@ ation is the most important .
it would have been without the destruction of the environment , but it would be that much more important .
so in the nuclear sector , there are other ideas .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ tin@@ a type that seems a little hard , but maybe that &apos;s what we say about us .
and so there is different , but the beautiful thing about this is that a ancient molecule has a million times more energy like ours , say , say , a co@@ le molecule , and that , if you can deal with the issues , and they are main@@ ly the radiation , the foot@@ print and the costs , the potential is the potential , so the impact on the land and other things , almost in a sense of your own lea@@ gue .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what does it ?
are we going to have emergen@@ cy interven@@ tions to try to keep resili@@ ence of the pyrami@@ d ?
b@@ g : when you come into this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been eating too much , and just before a heart attack is , what you &apos;re doing ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research facili@@ ty called ge@@ o@@ engineering that foc@@ uses with multiple techniques to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate the warming , so that we get 20 or 30 years longer to join us together .
that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance techni@@ que .
we &apos;re hop@@ ing we don &apos;t need it .
some people say that you shouldn &apos;t be working in@@ sur@@ ance because you might do this la@@ zy , so you keep on going , because you know you &apos;re going to save the heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart if you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a dis@@ course in ge@@ o@@ engineering about whether you should have available that , if things come faster , or you need this innovation longer than we expect .
cli@@ bal@@ ke@@ p@@ ti : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for the one to per@@ su@@ ade you ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tic lives in very different cam@@ ps .
those of the scientists who make the scientific argu@@ ments are very little .
do you say there &apos;s a negative effect that has to do with the clou@@ ds that are moving things around ?
there are very , very few things you can possibly tell , of which there is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is much more like aids .
you do the er@@ ror , and you pay a lot later for it a lot later .
and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of ur@@ gent problems to invest , you invest from something that you just have -- and in fact , the adop@@ tion is not so clear . in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c is not necessarily the worst thing . and there are people in the rich world who are looking at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and there are people in the rich world that says , okay , that &apos;s not a big dra@@ ma .
the fact is that these un@@ certain@@ ty should be wor@@ rying us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the skep@@ tics will say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter to me , the skep@@ tics , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter to me that it doesn &apos;t em@@ ph@@ ate co2 , i wish almost that it &apos;s che@@ aper , but i &apos;ll probably accept it , because it &apos;s che@@ aper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the b@@ j@@ dor@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals in suffering , the poverty redu@@ ction , which is conser@@ vation of malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a du@@ m@@ b waste of resources to invest money , while there are better things that we can do .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending for research -- we &apos;ll say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year spent more than they &apos;re doing today -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ matically .
those are not supposed to suff@@ er other things .
you get to big money , and you can dis@@ agree with reas@@ on@@ able people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and try to fund it . for me , most of waste is here .
except , you know , you &apos;re very quickly about a co@@ verage , and you &apos;re just paying the learning cur@@ ve , and i think we should try more things that the potential has a lot less che@@ aper .
if the off@@ board of the crash you get , a very high energy ri@@ ce , then you can only save the rich .
i mean , each one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifest@@ yle .
for the base of two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g think about it .
his new ma@@ ke@@ a is , &quot; why don &apos;t we talk more in research ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to associ@@ ate because his earlier stories associated with the skep@@ tic camp , but he understood that this is a very lon@@ ely group , and so he takes the research exploration .
and that is a temp@@ late that i &apos;m holding for .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little that is suppor@@ ted .
bill , i think for almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
b@@ g : thank you very .
a few years ago here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man wrote a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . four teams have to have the largest possible structure with 20 sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , about 1@@ m ta@@ pe , about 1@@ -@@ d fa@@ ils and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be up at the top .
and , even though it really seems simple , it &apos;s actually really difficult , because people are ur@@ ging very quickly together .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design work@@ shop .
it was a terri@@ fic success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 work@@ sh@@ ops around the world , with students , develop@@ ers and architec@@ ts , even with c@@ to@@ s the fortun@@ e 5@@ 0-@@ dollar companies , and there &apos;s something about this job that i think is possible to share deep impres@@ sions into the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you .
in fact , most people usually start to ori@@ ent themselves in the task .
you talk about it thinking about what it &apos;s going to look like , it ran@@ ves you around power .
then you invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and you sk@@ et@@ ch and put sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
they spend a majority of their time in the colle@@ ction of combin@@ ing growing structure .
and then eventually , before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and you put him smo@@ oth on the top , step back and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; ? ad@@ mi@@ ration your work and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da , &quot; you tell your work .
but what then , almost always , is that the ta@@ -@@ da is going to be like an &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low makes that the whole thing is stre@@ t@@ ched and fall@@ ing .
there are a number of people who have much more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh b@@ w@@ l swi@@ t@@ ches .
they lie , they che@@ at , they &apos;re conf@@ used and they really produce decisi@@ on-@@ real shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; forms , and among the best are fres@@ ber@@ ship of kinder@@ garten .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , peter did not only produce the highest to@@ wers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is : how is this happening ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells , &quot; nei@@ ther of the children invest@@ ed in ko@@ o of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in power@@ le .
now , there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that b@@ w@@ l &apos;s students were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and he then reali@@ zed it .
what happens when you put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s not a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what kids do differently is that , with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , they &apos;re starting to start and build prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always with mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low to the top , so that they have a tenden@@ cy to re@@ pair the ability to re@@ pair the b@@ lea@@ k prototyp@@ es .
con@@ struc@@ tive recognize this kind of partner as a real@@ m of an i@@ ter@@ a@@ tively .
and with each trial , the children get immedi@@ ate feedback what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance is to work with prototyp@@ es , mostly -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are acting .
the average for most of it is about two in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ l students get half of those , law@@ yers are a little more , but not much , kinder@@ garten children are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful one ?
architec@@ ts and engineers , for lu@@ ck@@ ily .
so , 1@@ 1@@ m is the highest thing that i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and as@@ pi@@ ration self-@@ am@@ pli@@ fi@@ d-@@ like ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ce@@ os are a little bit about average . but this is going to be interesting .
if you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , you &apos;re signific@@ antly better .
it &apos;s amazing . you look around , and you recognize &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predi@@ ction . why is this happening ?
because they have special skills of the process@@ ing .
you &apos;re leading the process , you &apos;re understanding it .
and that team that &apos;s spre@@ ading and sta@@ ys on work is not going to improve the exercise of the team .
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ ing skills and their combin@@ ation to succe@@ ed .
if you have 10 teams who are typical , you get about six , the stable structure .
so i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the po@@ ker in a same way .
so i provi@@ ded a $ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar software for w@@ inn@@ ers .
so what do they think about these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened here . it wasn &apos;t a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a 10@@ 5@@ -@@ in@@ ch con@@ struc@@ tion , he would have car@@ ried the prize home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competi@@ tions have a strong effect ?
we repe@@ ated this techni@@ que with the same students .
so what do you think right now ?
now , they understand the advantage of the prototyp@@ ing .
so from the same , bad team of one individual became the best .
they produced the highest consi@@ ga@@ tion in the fu@@ west time .
there &apos;s dep@@ -@@ scale lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
so you might ask : why would someone actually invest time to create a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , to help helping teams , computers , video games and &quot; vision . &quot;
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low does is , it helps to identify to identify assu@@ mp@@ tions .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , environmental stand@@ ure , to build the right prototyp@@ e .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested can visit mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ ship ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
there &apos;s a step per@@ -@@ step drive there .
they find crazy examples from all over the world , like people tun@@ tu@@ ze the system and re@@ fine .
there &apos;s also a world record .
and the base lesson , i believe , is actually the appar@@ at@@ us a commit@@ ment exercise .
we want everyone to embra@@ ce our senses to the task , and that we use our thinking opti@@ mal , as our emotions and our do , in the challenge that we become ahead of .
and sometimes , a little prototyp@@ e of the experience is everything that it needs to bring us from an &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; -- to a ta@@ -@@ da moment .
and that can make a lot of difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s do that as if we have a machine here .
there &apos;s a big machine , a cool , ted-@@ son@@ ic machine , and this is a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to bu@@ mp in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t go in here and you can now stay .
and i wonder what they would choose , because i often asked my friends to often ask this question , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time , before there was cars , or &quot; twitter , &quot; &quot; america would take the super@@ star . &quot;
e@@ z@@ ra : i don &apos;t
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re sort of dra@@ wn to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to your taste .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not a part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
it &apos;s because op@@ tions on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so , i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the great amount of time that ever gave birth on this planet , no matter what measure you : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunities , dec@@ lin@@ ing disease .
there has never been a time like this .
my ancient grand@@ parents were all died when they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents ur@@ ged that number to 70 .
my parents are 80 on the ro@@ cks .
so , there should be better one nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born in new del@@ hi can expect as long to live as long as the world &apos;s rich@@ est man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
now , why is that ?
small@@ po@@ x . the small@@ po@@ x have killed billions people on this planet .
they &apos;ve re-@@ sha@@ ped the demo@@ graphi@@ cs in a way of making the demo@@ graphi@@ cs in a way that has no war ever has
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re disappe@@ ared .
we con@@ forced them . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have even one generation of us , almost even one generation .
di@@ ph@@ on , cei@@ tain , pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful ...
does anyone know what this is ?
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the success@@ es of the scientific method .
and so , from my perspective , the scientific method to try things out , check out if it works , it will change it , if it doesn &apos;t do that , is one of the great achie@@ vement of humanity .
so , that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that , despite all our achie@@ v@@ ements , a billion people in the world go to sleep every day .
that number goes up , and it gets very quick , and it &apos;s com@@ e@@ cu@@ ting .
and not only that , we have used our imag@@ ination to de@@ force this world very differently .
drin@@ king water , ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ cal land , rain fore@@ sts , oil , gas : they &apos;re disappe@@ aring , and if we don &apos;t rele@@ ase ourselves from this chaos , we tend .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t destro@@ y at the same time .
i really think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a spo@@ gi@@ cal thinking .
but this is holding me a@@ wake at night -- one of the things that kept me a@@ wake at night . we &apos;ve never used scientific progress ever as ur@@ gent as now , never .
and we &apos;ve also been able to in@@ corpo@@ rate it sensi@@ ble , just like we can do today .
we &apos;re on the ti@@ p of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and i really think that we should go back hundreds of thousands of years before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment to find a time where we f@@ ought progress , where we &apos;ve created more of these things to more of the fron@@ ts than now .
people are tex@@ ting in their belief , and that is so ti@@ ghtly you can &apos;t rele@@ ase them .
it &apos;s not even the truth that will free it .
and listen , anybody has a right to his opini@@ on , even a right to think about progress .
but you know what , what they don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t quite have their own facts . &apos; high ad@@ cent , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure it out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article on vac@@ cin@@ ation for &quot; the new yor@@ ker , &quot; a little article .
and i was ama@@ zed to de@@ vote desire to resi@@ stance , to resi@@ stance , to what is the most effective operation in health care in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i did just what i would do , i wrote an article , and i kept going .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about gene@@ tically modi@@ fied fo@@ ods .
the same thing , just bigger .
people did lun@@ ry .
so , i wrote about this article also , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ ty food , &quot; why they believed that molecules in a particular way was being cop@@ i@@ ed a random way to the area of nature .
but , you know , i &apos;m doing what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on doing .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we give up , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but i was worried these artic@@ les made me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics that made me crazy were not making a fan@@ a@@ tic at all .
these were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , journ@@ ated people , inno@@ cent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that took me to me like this ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s say what we &apos;re honest .
we are at a point where we don &apos;t have the same connection to progress as we ever used .
we talk about it so sever@@ t@@ arian .
we talk absolutely ir@@ onic with little exhi@@ bi@@ tion about it : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s important about the reasons .
we have the trust in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that should not be that way .
you can just call a couple of names , and people will understand .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ tal , weapons destruction of destruction , the u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction in 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your your list list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we believed that they were always right . so , you know , skep@@ tical .
ask ask , ask you the evidence , desire evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but here &apos;s the thing : if you have to get evidence of this evidence , you &apos;re not good at it , and we &apos;re not good .
and i can say that from saying that we &apos;re living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and i hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that brought out autis@@ m epidemic with the mas@@ ses , mu@@ redu@@ es and the car@@ tel@@ ue v@@ acc@@ ine .
very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
cas@@ ual studies were done to see if that was cor@@ rect .
scre@@ ig@@ matic studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data began to come in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no connection , no connection , no .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we see , what we believe , that we make , that we really feel .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government attack that gives us data , and i think that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was sac@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c ha@@ l .
cat@@ ic@@ ha@@ l because of that fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world in which the imm@@ uni@@ zation for fern@@ s go .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
so what happened was that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does anybody actually have ?
does a single audience in the audience have ever seen anyone die of insects ?
not very often , not very often .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 6@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
these are many dea@@ ths through mas@@ ses , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can deter@@ mine it , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can run around and artic@@ ing images of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy of plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king live pre@@ ach@@ ing .
and you can do that because they don &apos;t connect causes cause and cor@@ ners .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something we have to learn , and it &apos;s very quick .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he liber@@ ated us from one of the worst viol@@ os of humanity .
not fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , not qu@@ enti@@ al , death , p@@ lau@@ ghter , gone .
the guy in the middle aren &apos;t so much .
he &apos;s called paul pres@@ it .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ vation v@@ acc@@ ine with a couple of other people .
he can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ - , 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world .
it &apos;s pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , contr@@ ary that paul is standing around and talking about vac@@ cin@@ es , and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop jam@@ ms .
and that &apos;s actually what it says .
so paul is is a terror@@ ist .
if paul talks about a public desire , he can &apos;t predict without any stran@@ ger guar@@ an@@ der .
he &apos;s getting calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
i don &apos;t need to say , but vac@@ cin@@ es are im@@ per@@ ative .
you take it further , you go back the diseases , terrible diseases , and this is happening .
we have mas@@ ses in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die back to them , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die in mas@@ s .
what about sex ? let &apos;s take this . why not ? why not ?
a com@@ pos@@ er of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and she said i &apos;m a little bit of pun@@ ch .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate her child for breast language . no , no .
whe@@ el .
why ? because we have no pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in la@@ gos this morning someone in la@@ gos this morning , and they fly to los angeles right now , he &apos;s about o@@ hi@@ o .
and he ended up in a few hours , he &apos;s got a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go visit one of these fantastic after@@ noon these fantastic ted days .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ zing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet we &apos;re living on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to sh@@ in us in lying . we love that .
have you all taken your vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ ate that helps them go on the jum@@ ps .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half of the americans do that every day .
they take this stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference of how often we find that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
the data is all constantly poin@@ ting .
they &apos;re frank@@ ly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating their ur@@ ine . more than never .
that &apos;s okay , they &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ci@@ in .
i complete to agree with them .
dar@@ ker ur@@ in . dark .
so why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical industry .
we hate an inten@@ se government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t have that . our health care system is mi@@ es .
it &apos;s st@@ um@@ bling to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and se@@ al@@ -@@ en@@ ab@@ ling to us that can afford .
so we &apos;re running out of the road , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re walking to the poor of plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love plac@@ e@@ bo industri@@ es .
but , you know , this is really serious , because that stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ pri@@ fs here .
not one of them -- g@@ ing@@ ko , be@@ ase , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ k , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s been de@@ fe@@ ated .
and you know what ? if i say that , people write me and say , &quot; what are you consu@@ ing you ? let people do what you want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the health minister who says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m going to not expect the evidence of my exper@@ graph@@ y to mammo@@ graph@@ y , or any cancer qu@@ ir@@ k that want to treat his patients with the lead agre@@ s . &quot;
if you &apos;re going to this path where belief and magic replace the evidence and science , you get a place to be in a place that you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people because he insi@@ sted that red bee@@ es , access and le@@ gos oil much more effectively than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs are much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs that we know can keep the ance@@ stry of aids .
hundreds of thousands of dea@@ ths in a country that is worse than any other of this disease is being be@@ aten .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have a con@@ sequence .
they &apos;re all ones . they always have .
now , the most cer@@ lo@@ dest epidemic that we &apos;re in at right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d battle between the as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of the gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te .
this is an i@@ ali@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
this is , ide@@ ology , not science .
all that we eat , every ri@@ ce of ri@@ ce , every second spi@@ il sil@@ re , every ro@@ se co@@ be , was changed by the people .
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ ines in ad@@ oles@@ of garden .
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe@@ -@@ mel@@ es .
there were no christ@@ mas trees . we did all of this .
we &apos;ve made it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of them worked and some of them didn &apos;t .
we got rid of that , which didn &apos;t work .
now we can make it closer . and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a in ri@@ ce , and the stuff can help millions of people to ex@@ tend their life .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
i &apos;ve got to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we engine@@ ered syste@@ matically from food .
so why do we do that ?
well , what i &apos;m hearing is all i &apos;m listening : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to be huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want to have companies see@@ king see@@ ds
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re as@@ pi@@ ra@@ cting it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
and that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s quite , mor@@ ality , pat@@ entation .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it works , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t toler@@ ate science to do their work , because we &apos;re fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed is a real finger , and they stop millions of people from blo@@ om .
you know , in the next 50 years , 70 percent , we &apos;re going to have to grow more food than right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa has been in the last 30 years .
sh@@ y . sh@@ am@@ ed .
you need that , and we &apos;re not giving it .
and why ? gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this broken stuff , like mani@@ o@@ ok .
mani@@ o is something that will eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ tat@@ ca@@ le .
it &apos;s just a bit@@ ting cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all that stuff in there
and then people could eat the food , and they would not be explo@@ red .
you wouldn &apos;t go star@@ vation , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be beautiful .
and so , all i can say is , why do we struggle this ?
i mean , why we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to sho@@ u@@ ge around genes ?
it &apos;s not about sending genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our resili@@ ence on greater food , better food , uni@@ qu@@ red food .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce cr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the ulti@@ mate time to understand what that means .
because do you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , when we continue with something like this we do , we do not want to be gu@@ il@@ ty that we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty , high-@@
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s un@@ willing , it &apos;s our not wor@@ thy , and we have to really stop it .
so after this incredibly fun career , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i &apos;m sure . i &apos;m certainly saying .
at the moment , you &apos;ll be in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can make this time machine on everything that we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;ll move them where we want to .
we need to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we have to think , but when we get into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be gla@@ d that we &apos;ve done that .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect . it might seem strange that a ma@@ gi@@ cian care that if you look at it as i , you look it as me , as &quot; a de@@ ception that will be something to be tru@@ sted if somebody feels clear enough to do it , &quot; because somebody belie@@ ves it will be true to it . &quot;
in other words , zu@@ cker@@ p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in some studies , called plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what to do with it is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or some kind of ... in pain management , for example , if the patient thinks only enough , there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body that is called plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
a de@@ ception becomes something real , because somebody percei@@ ves it like that .
so , in order for us to understand , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that is at least since the 195@@ 0s in every magic book for children .
i used to learn him from the cu@@ b sc@@ ale , from the sum@@ poin@@ ted fol@@ ders in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;m going to take him out for you and then tell him .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain to him .
so , let &apos;s see what happens .
the kni@@ fe you can analy@@ ze , my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m going to hold the kni@@ fe like this in my winter .
i &apos;m going back my sle@@ e@@ ve .
and to make sure that nothing in my trouble is going away , or coming out of it , i &apos;m just going to push my wr@@ ist right here .
you can see that at any time you can see that nothing is moving something , and as long as i &apos;m ligh@@ ting here , nothing can go to my sle@@ e@@ ve or come out of it .
and the goal of it is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is doing well , the kni@@ fe will be em@@ bed@@ ded by my favorite magne@@ tis@@ m .
it actually lies so hard to his place that i can sha@@ ke it without the kni@@ fe fall@@ ing down .
nothing moves into my sle@@ e@@ ve or coming out , no dou@@ bt , and you can study it all .
ta@@ -@@ da !
now , this is a trick that i often carry little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception , because you can see close about de@@ ception , even though it &apos;s very easy to do .
probably a lot of you in this room know this trick in the room .
and it works like this .
i think the kni@@ fe in my hand .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m wander@@ ing my wr@@ ist to make sure that nothing can get rid of my ni@@ ght@@ m@@ all or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i che@@ am@@ ed my wr@@ ist is that there &apos;s the actual secret of illusion .
in that moment , where i turn my hand away from you , so that you see them from behind , this finger moves here , my proto@@ finger , just from there where it was , in a position where it was so stre@@ t@@ ched .
terri@@ fic trick ?
there is somebody in the back there who didn &apos;t have a childhood .
so , he &apos;s standing here . right .
and when i turn around , the fing@@ ers change his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t realize that here at the bottom of just three fing@@ ers , because the mind and the way it process information , it doesn &apos;t count including , one , two , three , but you see it as a group .
but that &apos;s actually not going on here . and then i open my hand .
of course , there &apos;s going to be stuck there , but not through the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but a trick , through my pres@@ entation finger , that &apos;s there now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by watching me is hidden by this movement , that the fing@@ ers will move back back .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
this is a trick you can do to your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
a year ago , i read a study or something , i read a study that really dre@@ w me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why this was an amazing thing for me .
well , it turns out this : if you give a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , in the form of an as@@ pir@@ in@@ tab@@ let , that &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill that has a particular meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
but if you give the shape in which you give the plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , alter into a smaller p@@ ill , and e@@ mu@@ late these blue and p@@ ure a letter on it , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
and that , of course , although none of them are a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re just sugar p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? that was really what i got me out of .
well , it turns out that that &apos;s not all of it .
when you take cap@@ su@@ les , the even more effective than tab@@ lets are every shape .
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le that &apos;s yellow at one end and at the other red , it &apos;s better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
the do@@ sage is playing a role .
a mush@@ room is two times a day , not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember the pre@@ cise stati@@ stic . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key is , ...
... that too the do@@ ses shape a role .
and the form is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you have to move to the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with a sup@@ tili@@ ty -- a few milli@@ li@@ ters of an effective sub@@ stance that you inje@@ ct a patient .
that puts a very strong picture in your head . that &apos;s much stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
this ch@@ art is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a proje@@ ctor .
so the fact of the matter is that the white p@@ ill doesn &apos;t appear as well as the blue p@@ ill that doesn &apos;t appear as well as a cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t seem as well as the need@@ le .
and none of that has a real pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical property . it &apos;s just our belief in which it creates a stron@@ ger effect in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a ma@@ gi@@ cal trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a de@@ ception , and let it look really hard .
we know from that study that you have to reach to the need@@ le , if it &apos;s supposed to be about the issue .
this is a 24@@ -@@ in@@ ch hu@@ t@@ ne@@ l . she &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to first get a little bit ster@@ ili@@ zed by the first little
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . it &apos;s not ste@@ asi@@ an speci@@ alized fl@@ es@@ h
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to stick this need@@ le in my skin and drive through them until they boun@@ ce on the other side .
if you &apos;re horri@@ ble -- if you &apos;re easy to lose -- i pres@@ ented that a few friends in the hotel room last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman had to have it almost ir@@ redu@@ ci@@ ble .
so i pro@@ pose if you &apos;re fast you &apos;ll look very hard , look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first heal@@ ing part here .
you can see it just the same , but you can see it again , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , right where my metal starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to do a little bit .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make it crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin , and on the other side , this is like this .
now , in fact , we &apos;re in the same situation that we &apos;ve had at sear@@ ser@@ atz .
something about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , aren &apos;t you ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes .
i know what people think , when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so stupid and push through itself the skin just to enter us for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show it to you .
so what does this look like ? quite good .
yeah , i know .
and people behind behind say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the side door now go in with us .
so let me show you just the close .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my hum@@ p , and i can fli@@ p this around .
sorry . if you get horri@@ ble , look away , look at you , don &apos;t look at it .
the people behind the back or those who later see video on video will say , &quot; well , that looks pretty impres@@ sive , but if it were real , it would be -- you see , there &apos;s a hole , and there , if it really would be real , it would ble@@ ed . &quot;
okay , so let me cra@@ p a little bit of blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i usually would like to take the need@@ le out now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wo@@ unds .
but i think in this frame , and with the purpose , to make something real out of a de@@ ception , i &apos;m just going to put the need@@ le in there and go from the stage .
so we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
everyone &apos;s going to talk about happiness today .
i let some people count the number of books that were published with happiness , in the ti@@ tles in the last five years , and they gave up at about 40 , and there was much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in which they &apos;re in researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of lu@@ ck@@ word co@@ ach@@ ing .
everybody would love to make people happ@@ ier .
but despite all these flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive ones that just make it impossible , reas@@ fully think about happiness .
and my talk today is basically going to act from these cognitive tra@@ its .
this is true for la@@ ke that thinks about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who are thinking about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re so ab@@ und@@ ant as everybody else .
the first of these is a con@@ tradi@@ ction to ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly ad@@ mit@@ ted complexity
it turns out the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to a lot of different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could nar@@ row it on , but in a way , it &apos;s something that we need to be giving up , and we &apos;re going to embra@@ ce the complicated perspective for what &apos;s good .
the second element is a promise of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy with his life or happiness with his life .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both in the idea of the idea of happiness .
and the third is focused illusion , and that &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about a deal that influ@@ ences well-@@ being without bri@@ ber@@ y to bri@@ ber@@ y their meaning
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with somebody who had a q answer s@@ ession , after one of my lec@@ tures who report a story . &#91; un@@ clear -- &#93; he said he had heard a fe@@ ature , and it was absolutely written music , and at the end of the recor@@ ding , there was a terrible cy@@ cles of sound .
and then , he ad@@ ded , really quite emotional , that has ru@@ ined the entire experience .
but that didn &apos;t have it .
and what it was ru@@ ined was the memor@@ ies of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had written 20 minutes of small@@ ly music .
they didn &apos;t eat because he was living with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had to keep .
so what that really says to us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there is a vi@@ vi@@ an self that lives in the present and knows the present is capable of experi@@ en@@ cing the past , but actually has only the present .
it &apos;s the living self that com@@ pla@@ ined the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; do it hurt if i can turn you here ? &quot;
and then there is a remin@@ ding , and the memory self is this that coun@@ ts and reach@@ es the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor as@@ ks by asking the question , &quot; how did you feel about this l@@ ately ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different un@@ its , the living self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and they &apos;re part of the sub@@ stance of happiness of happiness .
now , the memory self is a story@@ t@@ ell@@ er .
and that really starts with a profound response to our memor@@ ies -- it starts on immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re going to tell stories about stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can hold away from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s give you a simple example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who participa@@ te in a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
i won &apos;t go into the details of it today . it &apos;s not pain@@ ful today , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was done in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to tell all the 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their recor@@ ds .
and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who &apos;s from both have more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suff@@ ered more . his world@@ refle@@ ction was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had hal@@ f-@@ 0 , and more .
but now , there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients thought they could suff@@ er ? &quot;
and here &apos;s what a surprise is .
and the surprise is that the patient had a much worse remem@@ ption to the screen refle@@ ction than the patient b .
the stories of repres@@ enting refle@@ ctions were different , and because a very important part of the story is , how it ends .
and none of these stories is very in@@ geni@@ ous or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is very sever@@ ely worse than the other .
and the one who is worse was the place where the pain was at the end of his cli@@ ma@@ x . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these guys after their gut refle@@ ction , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the full thing in all ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in the b for b .
now , this is a direct conflict between the ear@@ living self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
from the stand@@ life of the extin@@ ct itself , it had definitely a worse time .
now , what you could do with the patient , and we actually did a clinical experiments , and it was made , and it works , you could actually ex@@ tend the copy of the patient by just incre@@ bing the tube without sha@@ king too much on it .
it &apos;s going to cause the patient , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you do this for a few minutes you make that the living self is poor from the patient , and you get it that the memory itself is much better off by the patient , because now you have a better story about his experience .
so what did a story have like ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that are provi@@ ding to memory , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we &apos;re creating .
so what a story is made of are tran@@ scen@@ ding , significant moments and ends .
end are very , very important , and in this case the end is domin@@ ari@@ zed .
now , the living self lives his life continu@@ ously .
it has moments of life , one at a time .
and you say , what &apos;s going to happen to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most look at our lives -- and i sus@@ pe@@ ct it -- you know the psych@@ ological present is true than three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a life , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a life . most of you won &apos;t leave a lan@@ e .
most of you will be totally ignor@@ ed from remem@@ ber@@ ing yourself .
and yet , they get the impres@@ sion that you should count that what happens during this moments of human life happens our lives .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re consum@@ ing as we are in the world .
and how we need it would be important to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that kee@@ ps the memory itself for us .
so we have the memory self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the most significant difference between them is dealing with time .
so from the perspective of self-@@ susta@@ ining , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the sing@@ ing vac@@ u@@ um .
that &apos;s not how all of this works for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self
for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ u@@ um is har@@ dly better than the one teen@@ eless vac@@ ation , because there are no new memor@@ ies to be ad@@ ded .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a memor@@ ing self from an e@@ ternal self , time very little impact on this story .
now , the more memory himself makes more than remem@@ ber@@ ing and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who , if you have two patterns , at two different surge@@ ons , and deci@@ des what it should choose , then the one who choo@@ ses the memory that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on who will be sel@@ ec@@ ted .
the living self doesn &apos;t have any voice in that choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t actually vote between experience . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think about our future as a experience .
we think about our future as a predi@@ cted memor@@ ies .
and in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of memory itself , and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self as one , that kind of the living self li@@ f@@ ts through experiences that doesn &apos;t need the living themselves .
i have the impres@@ sion that , when we do vac@@ u@@ um , it &apos;s very common the case , which means we &apos;re making vac@@ ation lar@@ gely in the service of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
i mean , how much do we store from our memor@@ ies ?
this is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of memory itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vac@@ ation that we &apos;ve been doing on ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think relatively often , in relation to how often i think that we &apos;re thinking about other vac@@ a@@ che .
and i probably would have told me about my memory of this three-@@ wee@@ dy journey , i would say , for 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever opened the con@@ cre@@ te with the 600 pictures in this , i would have spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s only a one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours .
there seems to be a dis@@ agre@@ ement there .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have to drive memory on memor@@ ies , but even when you make more of them , there &apos;s a real question : why do we give memor@@ ies so much of the time that to the weight that we &apos;re about to experience ?
so , i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next ho@@ li@@ days , you know that at the end of the pa@@ pe , everyone &apos;s depres@@ sed to all their images , and you get a am@@ nes@@ eric drug so you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you take a different vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two selves , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , it &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of memor@@ ies of memor@@ ies , you could get a different answer .
why we choose the ur@@ li@@ ty that we choose is a problem that comes with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self are thro@@ wing two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per per self .
so you can ask : how happy is this person &apos;s living ?
and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the extin@@ ct itself ?
and you &apos;re all -- happiness for ev@@ ange@@ ings is a pretty complicated process .
and which are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to make a very good idea about happiness itself over time .
if you ask , after the happiness of remem@@ ber@@ ing itself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about happiness or enjo@@ ying the person if this person thinks about their lives .
very different phr@@ ase .
anyone who &apos;s not dist@@ ingu@@ ished these terms is going to solve exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m stuck with a lot of researchers about well-@@ being that have mess@@ ed the exploration of happiness for that kind of thing .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness itself and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate separate .
the gall@@ up organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there have been a lot of effort in the direction .
so in the last couple of years , we &apos;ve been beginning to learn about happiness of the two types of self .
and the main lesson that i think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and they really don &apos;t know a lot about how happy he lives his life and vice around the other .
just to give you an idea of cor@@ rela@@ tions , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
so what that means is , if you were to meet somebody , and you would tell you , oh , his dad is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life at a level of 10 have in@@ formed at a level of 10 , they have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy it is with his ear@@ ned self .
and so the cor@@ relation is smaller .
we know something about what &apos;s caus@@ ing happiness of happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness main@@ ly means to be satis@@ fied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleas@@ ures , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze happiness of the two selves of self , they will end up doing very different things at the end .
the impli@@ cations of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t really think of happiness as a re@@ plac@@ ement for well-@@ being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , just very brie@@ fly , another reason that we can &apos;t really think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the wr@@ on@@ ishing answer .
if you think that question you have to be happ@@ ier in california , if you , say , lives in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for living itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thou@@ ght@@ ful self that choo@@ sing how happy people are .
well , because the atten@@ ding self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could at the end of california draw to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pur@@ sue what happens to people who want to draw to california in hope to get happ@@ ier .
well , your de@@ dic@@ ate self is not going to be happ@@ ier .
we know this .
but one thing &apos;s going to happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happ@@ ier , because if you &apos;re thinking about it , you &apos;re remin@@ ded how awful the weather in o@@ hi@@ o was , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right choice .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-@@ being , and i hope that i &apos;ve given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you very much .
now , when we launched a couple of weeks ago , they announ@@ ced to me that there was a pretty interesting out@@ come that was transl@@ ated from this gall@@ on .
is this something that they can tun@@ e us for a couple of minutes because they &apos;ve been left for a few minutes ?
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the gall@@ on is a number that we &apos;ve not had a chance to find
and we thought that was , in terms of the happiness of the effort itself .
when we looked at how feelings are vari@@ ed with income .
and it turns out that , under a run of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sam@@ ple of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a big repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple , under a coun@@ cil of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year .
six@@ t@@ y-@@ two .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they &apos;re increasingly getting less un@@ happy and more afraid the longer .
and we get an absolutely flat line about it .
i mean , i &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen such flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money is not off@@ ered to you , but that lack of money sur@@ ely incre@@ ases suff@@ i@@ cient , and we can measure this dam@@ n very , very clearly .
in the sense of the other self , the recei@@ ving itself , you get a different story .
the more money you ear@@ n the happy you &apos;re happ@@ ier .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but dan@@ ny , in all of the american re@@ gre@@ ts , it &apos;s life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people take seriously this sen@@ sation , i mean , it seems to put everything on its head , everything that we believe , for example , for spir@@ ing politics and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country general would take a contr@@ ary like serious , and make it based on politics ?
d@@ k : you know , i think it &apos;s recogni@@ tion for the role of happiness research in politics .
the recogni@@ tion will be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , it happens and in other countries you &apos;re going to see .
people are interested in recogni@@ zing that you should think of lu@@ ck when you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will debate if they want to explore experience happiness , or whether they want to explore food re@@ vie@@ ws , so we have to have that discussion quite soon .
how to increase happiness is very different on how you think and whether you think of the thinking itself , or if they think of the feeling itself , or whether they think of the living themselves .
this will influence policy , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states , you can remember to measure the experience of the population of the population .
this is going to , i think , in the next generation or two decades of national present .
well , it seems to me that this top@@ ic is going , or should at least the most interesting political debate to pur@@ sue over the next couple of years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
thank you very , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m designing video games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , how it &apos;s to save in online games .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people , including all of them to spend more time with playing bigger and great games .
currently , we spend three billion hours a week playing with online games .
so some of you may think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little bit too much time when you consider how many problems we des@@ per@@ ately have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , in the institute for the institute for the future , i &apos;m involved in exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week , are not nearly enough to solve the most pres@@ sing problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced , if we want to survive the next century on the planet , we need to dra@@ matically increase this time .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated that time is spent at 21 billion hours of play a week .
this may seem a little bit dist@@ ant first , so i repe@@ at it so that if we can act it : if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think we have to try to solve games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean really , really seriously .
why ? this picture descri@@ bes very pre@@ cis@@ ely , why i believe that games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously
this is a photograph@@ er by the photograph@@ er elli@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
he wanted to capture the feelings in play , so he set up a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classi@@ cal expres@@ sions playing in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might dis@@ miss some of the nu@@ an@@ ces in this picture .
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little fear , but also transpar@@ ent concent@@ ration , which is rapi@@ dly inter@@ rup@@ ted to the resol@@ ution of a really difficult problem .
if you also play , you see some nu@@ an@@ ces here that go up@@ up into the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m . the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ w illu@@ str@@ ates surprise .
this is a custom@@ er that says on the edge of a so-@@ called epi@@ ic se@@ al .
oh , you know that . ok . exc@@ ma . so we &apos;ve got some players here .
a epi@@ c vic@@ tory is a result , which is so over@@ -@@ positive that you didn &apos;t know that it was at all possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when you get it , you &apos;re sho@@ cked that you &apos;re actually capable of this thing . that &apos;s an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
this player is just in front of a epi@@ ic vic@@ tory .
and this is what we need to see in millions faces of proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ ou@@ s@@ ers around the world , if we attack the barri@@ ers of the next century , the face of those who are standing against all the el@@ se@@ ties on the edge of a epi@@ ic dying .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life , when we face hard problems .
i call it as the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; face , and it &apos;s actually my face , are you see ? yeah ? ok .
this is me , what i &apos;m doing , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti at my former home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i study in my ph@@ d for why we &apos;re better in games than in real life .
this is a problem that a lot of players have .
we think that we &apos;re not as good as playing in reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s what it &apos;s supposed to do .
we &apos;re getting more in the play@@ most anymore . i &apos;m obs@@ ess@@ ing with the motivation to do something significant , inspired to collaboration with collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us turning into our best version , any@@ time , and inst@@ antly are willing to help solve the problem , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary to keep it again after the fail .
and in fact , if we fall failure , if we break on ob@@ stac@@ les , we often feel different .
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we feel de@@ fe@@ ated . we feel thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , maybe depres@@ r@@ ed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
we never have any pleasure when we play games , in games , they just don &apos;t .
and this is what i wanted to investi@@ gate as a ph@@ .@@ d. student .
why is it impossible in play to think , you could not just get anything there ?
how can we trans@@ late these feelings from playing into reality into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of war@@ craft that provi@@ des the ide@@ al environment to the collective proble@@ m-@@ solving .
and i &apos;ve identi@@ fied a couple of things that make the epi@@ c vic@@ tory in online worl@@ ds .
so , first , if you go in one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there are a lot of different characters willing to be willing to trust you a global mission , and that &apos;s inst@@ antly .
but not just any mission , but a mission that is perfectly fit to its current level in the game , right ?
so you &apos;re going to do that .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the side of your ability , so you have to work on it , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in the world of war@@ craft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you &apos;re twi@@ sting . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of collabor@@ ators .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work together with them to finish their epi@@ c mission .
we don &apos;t have that simple in the real life , that feeling that a finger@@ stro@@ ke is ready to be happy to sleep .
and also , there is this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level a strong &quot; and &quot; 25@@ 1 strength &quot; or &quot; four@@ 1 intelligence . &quot;
that const@@ ant feedback is not in the real life .
if i leave that stage , i didn &apos;t have verse one talking and i have multi@@ 1 crazy idea , plus 20 crazy crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in the real life .
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative worl@@ ds like the world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to stand at any@@ moment on the edge of a epi@@ c vic@@ tory , that we pre@@ fer all our time in these games .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
up to today , all the world of war@@ cra@@ fing players have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years to solve the virtual issues of a@@ er@@ ering .
it &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound mess@@ y .
but to look at it in context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago , our first pri@@ mate ancestors began to walk up@@ right .
so the first step of exciting pri@@ mate .
ok , so when we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend playing with play , that makes sense when you keep time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it &apos;s appropriate . because it turns out that by using all this time , we actually change what we &apos;re capable of as human beings .
we &apos;re developing tively to collabor@@ ative thinking , heart creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe in that .
now , consider this interesting stati@@ stic that recently was published by a resear@@ cher by car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university , the average young human being spending 10,000 hours in a country with heavy piano culture to the age of 21 to the year of the
now , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first , for kids in the united states , for children in the united states , 10@@ .@@ 0@@ 80 hours they spend the accu@@ rate amount of labor that they spend in school from high school -- if you don &apos;t .
so here we have a full par@@ alle@@ l background , where young people learn exactly what it means to be a good player , like everything else that you &apos;re learning at school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; over@@ bom@@ bed . &quot;
so , you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we pay 10,000 hours with the wa@@ il@@ ing to study any of the subject for the 21@@ st century to the 21@@ st century , we &apos;re going to master within it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever we do as far as the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the ma@@ ster@@ -@@ players .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players of ma@@ ster@@ y good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never would have never been able to give human potential before .
so many people we have right now in the world , who spend at least an hour each day with online games a day .
these are our ma@@ ster@@ -@@ players : 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the play industry developed con@@ form@@ es that save energy and work on power plants instead of the broad@@ band internet , so players around the world , in particular in india , china , brazil online .
you expect an extra billion billion players in the next decade .
and that &apos;s where we have 1.@@ 5 billion players .
so i started to think about what it is that we &apos;re doing these games with us .
here are four things that i found . first of all , vulner@@ ability optimis@@ m .
ok , think of it as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation .
vulner@@ ability optimis@@ m is desire to do something right now to fo@@ ften a hur@@ d@@ le , with the faith that we have an in@@ formed hope on success .
gam@@ player always belie@@ ves that an ex@@ ternal vic@@ tory is possible , and that it &apos;s always wor@@ rying to try and keep it ali@@ ke .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
players are the master in the spi@@ ders relative to social nets .
there are a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they de@@ fe@@ ated us .
and the reason for that is that it dem@@ ands a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we &apos;re tru@@ sting that someone &apos;s giving us time that the rules are going to stop , that we have the same goal and to the end of the game .
so that allows that interaction to grow from bin@@ ds , trust and with each other .
as a result , we build stron@@ ger social relationships .
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . amazing !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of war@@ cra@@ l players playing 22 hours a week , sort of part@@ -@@ time job .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier at work harder than if we &apos;re rela@@ x@@ ing or doing nothing .
we know that we as human beings work opti@@ mal when we do hard , meaning@@ ful work .
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , ac@@ ute signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce .
gam@@ ers love to become part of the ra@@ ti@@ ve mis@@ sions of planet@@ ary mis@@ sions .
this is a back forma@@ tion to bring it into the right light , you know all wikipedia , the biggest wi@@ ki of the world .
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 in@@ t@@ nan@@ ts is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
there &apos;s five million people every month use it .
they &apos;ve put more information about the world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other issue in every other wi@@ ki in every other wi@@ ki in the world .
they create an epi@@ c story .
they create a epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
ok , so , so that &apos;s four super@@ power@@ s that lead to a single result . players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as an individual .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worl@@ ds , but not the real .
this is the problem that i try to solve .
ed@@ ward ca@@ at@@ o@@ va is a spe@@ ph@@ scientist .
his work is geni@@ us . he explor@@ es why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to paint from not less than a mass a@@ migra@@ tion in virtual worl@@ ds and online colle@@ ctions . &quot;
and that &apos;s by an econom@@ ist . so it &apos;s logi@@ cal .
and he says , &quot; ...
i &apos;m not like playing -- i &apos;m playing , i &apos;m a little bit more attra@@ cted .
so , he says that makes sense actually , because players can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than in real life .
they can make more powerful social bin@@ ties than in real life . they get more feedback and re@@ wards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s completely logi@@ cal that gam@@ les spend more time in the virtual world than in real use .
i agree to you , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
but it &apos;s definitely not a opti@@ tic situation .
we need to start to transform the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that is left behind 2,@@ 500 years .
there &apos;s these an@@ en cu@@ be made out of she@@ ets . you know ?
in front of these fantastic game controll@@ ers , there was a pla@@ te .
and these were kind of the first of people who were evol@@ ving play@@ through@@ s .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the stuff of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ p@@ ca , you may know this story . the story about how , and why games have been invented .
according to her@@ l@@ ot@@ us games , games were more similar , in the king@@ dom of ly@@ di@@ es , in a fam@@ ine .
now there was such a great fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ di@@ es was that the king of ly@@ di@@ es determin@@ ed to a crazy idea .
people suff@@ ered . people were f@@ ed .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , which is her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the box game and beg@@ ged a national strategy , one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be wired so much in the box game , because gam@@ ingly , they &apos;re so fascinating and they surro@@ unded us with satis@@ fying , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and for her@@ so@@ ot@@ us , they lived so 18 years of this fam@@ ine by they ate this fam@@ ine one day and the next round .
also , in the same way , i think that we now associ@@ ate games today .
we &apos;re playing play to solve the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re playing an play to solve everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not satis@@ fying in real life , and we &apos;re going to get ourselves out of what we need from the games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting one .
now , for 18 years , because of her@@ l@@ ot@@ us , fam@@ ine didn &apos;t work better , so the king decided to put one last bar@@ k game .
they divi@@ ded the king@@ dom in two .
they played a cu@@ pi@@ a game , and the w@@ inner had to break to an epi@@ ic ad@@ vent@@ ure .
they closed ly@@ di@@ es , and they went looking for a new home , they just left so many people , as there was food to survive , and they looked at the rest of the neighborhood in which they could thri@@ ve .
it sounds mad , right ?
but the lat@@ est dna evidence shows that the implan@@ tation , later the ro@@ man real@@ m , was formed the same dna , the same dna as the old ly@@ di@@ ans .
so scientists recently came to view that her@@ p@@ ot@@ us &apos;s crazy story is actually true .
and ge@@ ologists found the evidence of a global cool@@ ing , that used almost 20 years of what the fam@@ ine could explain .
so this crazy story could be heard .
maybe they actually saved their people through play , by mess@@ ing 18 years in games , and then had this own input , and they learned so much about each other that they saved the entire civilization .
so , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing since 199@@ 4 war@@ craft .
this was the first alternative game in real time in the world of war@@ cra@@ l series . it was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years of to@@ fing , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for four years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own signi@@ cal play .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , and so i took my 21 billion dollar hours a week .
we should over@@ come that half of us spend an hour per day with play until we solved the problems of the physical world .
you know , you &apos;re going to ask me , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot; and so , exactly this question i &apos;ve de@@ vot@@ ed my work in the last few years to the future .
we &apos;ve pres@@ cri@@ be this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , it &apos;s sending out how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future ever before .
what we want , is to create the future .
we want to introdu@@ ce the best possible out@@ come , and then em@@ power@@ ing people to imple@@ ment this idea into reality .
we hi@@ re environmental vic@@ tor@@ ies and we give people the ways to achie@@ ve it .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to create people of ex@@ ic ra@@ ces in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
this is the game from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to over@@ come a oil sc@@ ar@@ city .
the oil sc@@ ar@@ city is invented , but we have enough online content to be reali@@ stic for you , and you &apos;re living your real life without oil . so , if you write up to game , say where you live . and then you get news movies in real time that you can show how much oil costs , how does it be , how it &apos;s stor@@ es , whether it &apos;s stor@@ es , and you have to figure out how to create your real life if it were true , and we ask them to blog about their real life if it were true . and we ask them to explore about it , send about it , repor@@ ting videos or photographs
we &apos;ve te@@ sted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been ac@@ compan@@ ying it for the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure , and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going out the oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure that you &apos;re going to go on .
find out how they would survive , and most of our players have main@@ tain@@ ed who the game has been doing in the
so we have a bigger , more higher goal for the next biggest game than just oil sc@@ ar@@ city .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; super@@ fu@@ sel@@ ures &quot; at the institute for the future .
the point is that compu@@ tation is a super@@ computer compu@@ tation that people only have left 23 years on the planet .
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global curi@@ osity , sensi@@ tivity system , &quot; of course .
the call of the players to express himself , we almost created like a &quot; jer@@ ny stu@@ ck@@ a@@ mer &quot; film .
you know , jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ a@@ hit@@ -@@ movies , where it &apos;s the &quot; revol@@ ting team . you have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientists , the ex@@ -@@ ro@@ tter bed , and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the w@@ am@@ ard team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
ei@@ 3,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 really creative solutions that they can read when they goo@@ gl@@ ed &quot; super@@ mal@@ sel@@ ware . &quot;
and the last piece we bring out on the 3@@ rd mar@@ ch : it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you close that game , you get the world bank shel@@ ter of social fol@@ d@@ ant , gradu@@ ation in 2010 .
we work with universi@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we invi@@ te them to learn more social re@@ designs .
we have a com@@ ic thing to it . we have level high for regi@@ onal understanding , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity .
i &apos;d like to invi@@ te you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , in development of var@@ ie@@ ties that benefit from them together to save their own social enter@@ prise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to go to the end .
i want to ask you a little bit .
so what do you think happens to next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree to me that gam@@ ers are human resource that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have all these super@@ power@@ s , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to atta@@ ch loo@@ se social networks , dur@@ ability optimis@@ m and the desire for pro@@ gen@@ ic importance .
i really hope we &apos;re playing meaning@@ ful games to survive on this planet a next century .
and i hope that you will design and play with me like this .
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m safe at two things : that we can create any imag@@ ent@@ able future , and that we can play all sorts of games .
so i &apos;m saying let &apos;s start the world &apos;s changing games !
thank you . .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that occur@@ red to me a few months ago in writing a itali@@ an article a group of itali@@ an .
i kept writing my syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary gri@@ pped out my syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary , but i &apos;ve been fascin@@ ated with the writing of the text , and i noticed that i never looked at my life in my life what the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; really means
i &apos;m going to read the introdu@@ ction .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , &quot; ad@@ je@@ cted , means , comfort , destro@@ ying , wa@@ sted , destro@@ yed , tor@@ ed , im@@ po@@ und , ab@@ sent , dis@@ coura@@ ged , im@@ po@@ tent , dis@@ posed , im@@ po@@ tent , ge@@ m@@ di@@ te sen@@ k , a@@ im@@ ed , a@@ po@@ tent , made out of the background , tor@@ tured , doing , de@@ ar , broken , harv@@ est@@ ing , consum@@ ed , wa@@ kes also hurt , de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing , us@@ eless .
ant@@ ony@@ m : healthy , strong , deli@@ en@@ able . &quot;
i read this list of a friend of mine , and had to lau@@ gh , it was so ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but i just got to say , &quot; i just couldn &apos;t talk , &quot; and i had to stop reading and start to collect , and i finally started to collect myself after this over@@ conf@@ ated word , and the inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness of emotional sho@@ ck .
of course , this was a popular , old syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary . i just thought that the paper had to be pretty old .
but actually , it was a theme in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , when i was just starting to take in element@@ ary school , and started building my sense of self through my family space , also in relation to other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary at that time .
if i were to take this post seriously in a world that would sense someone like me , someone like me would percei@@ ve a person whose life did not run positive , and today , i &apos;m going to argue for the opportunity and ad@@ vent@@ ure that i experienced .
so i immediately called up the online edi@@ tion of 2009 , and i expected to find a more p@@ ure mistake here .
here &apos;s the fo@@ unding version of this in the program .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
specifically the last words under &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ m &quot; is &quot; all right and &quot; good &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are sitting in these words , and how we constru@@ ct these values .
our language is affec@@ ting our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
in many recent societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the ro@@ wel@@ s , they really believed that the emergen@@ cy of a flight has really got a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about is also mani@@ fest you .
so , what do we want to actually become mani@@ fest -- a dis@@ ab@@ led of people or a powerful people ?
just to draw a person in ei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness as a child , they could express , push them and over@@ sign ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice , to open them do@@ ors ?
a person who had opened for me , opened up was my pe@@ ger at a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton in del@@ soon .
he &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o . a it@@ al americans , he can think that most americans couldn &apos;t talk to true , so he was called dr. p@@ . . so he was called dr. p@@ . .
and dr. p@@ . le@@ cks very color@@ y fly , and was just created for the work with children .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just great -- except for my physi@@ cal therapy .
i had to have individual practic@@ es to keep up with these big , el@@ a@@ stic ben@@ ds -- in different colors -- you know to build my leg mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed these ta@@ pes more than anything . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them .
and imagine that in fact , as a five-@@ year-old , i negoti@@ ated with dr. p@@ . a child , trying to stop this exercise , natural success without success .
and one day he looked at one of my tests -- these exercise were just ti@@ ring and ad@@ jac@@ ent -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re such a strong , ener@@ ge@@ tic and te@@ ar girl , you will one day cover one of those b@@ ands .
and if you do , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now that was , of course , a simple trick of dr. p@@ . so that i did not want to do the practic@@ es that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the idea that the rich@@ est five girls in the hospital were to be in the hospital floor , but actually he made me to see my daily hor@@ ror with new eyes , and it became a new and a very promis@@ ing experience .
and i wonder today how much of his vision of me was sha@@ ped as a big and powerful young girl , and i could imagine to see me as a natural nature of strong , coura@@ ge@@ ous and at@@ le@@ th@@ ic man .
this is just an example of many , many ways adults can rel@@ ate to the imagination of a child .
but as they prove these already trained examples from syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ aries , our language gives us no room to imagine what we would wish to all wish : to en@@ able anyone to see themselves as a powerful human being .
our language depen@@ ds to the social changes that have been caused by many of the technologi@@ cal change in many cases .
from the medical stand@@ point , of course , you can tell that my legs , which las@@ er surgery for visu@@ al@@ y-@@ dis@@ ab@@ led , k@@ od@@ les from ti@@ tan and art@@ ly sk@@ ell@@ ing for aging , that allow people to really take all their opportunities and there@@ across the boundar@@ ies that have their natural dest@@ in@@ y to develop , not to speak of social net@@ worked plat@@ forms , people are allowed to have a identity to define in their way , and to explore the world worldwide to groups that they pick themselves .
now , it may be clear to this technologi@@ cal change , because ever that there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human in society can give something very special and very powerful , and that the human capacity to ada@@ pt , our biggest plus is to custom@@ ize itself , our biggest plus .
human ability to ada@@ pt -- this is an interesting story , because people always try to tell me how to deal with san@@ chan@@ cy , and i &apos;m going to agree with you : this phr@@ ase has never adap@@ ted for me , and i always felt very un@@ comfortable to answer questions of people , and i think i &apos;m gradu@@ ally aware why .
this monit@@ y of dealing with v@@ ali@@ ties lives by the idea that success or happiness depen@@ ds to address a challenge without being sha@@ ped by the associated experience , as if my life would have been so successful , i could percei@@ ve the potential of a life with a pro@@ s@@ thetic , or whatever people percei@@ ve me with my dis@@ ability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re inten@@ ded by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotion@@ ally or even both .
and i &apos;m as@@ sum@@ ing that it &apos;s good .
san@@ chan@@ ti@@ ties are no ob@@ stac@@ le that we have to re@@ gre@@ te to get better with our lives .
ten@@ ds are easy to live to our lives .
and i tend to think of increasing heal@@ ing as my sha@@ dow .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s pretty close to seeing , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to stick with the impact of a human &apos;s mind , immer@@ se the sensi@@ ble of
there are vac@@ u@@ ties and challenges in life , and they &apos;re just soli@@ d , and every person goes around with it , but the question isn &apos;t whether we &apos;re getting concerned or not , but how we can get out of it .
so we are not just responsible to preser@@ ve the people that we love to preser@@ ve from dan@@ f stri@@ ps , but to pre@@ p@@ are them to get good with it
and we don &apos;t like to love our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t ada@@ pt .
you have to conclu@@ de two things : for one reason , the medical field , am@@ pu@@ tion , and on the other social opini@@ on about whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
and to be honest , the only real and en@@ ab@@ ling dis@@ ability that i needed to explore with is that the world meant constantly , it could describe me with these defini@@ tions .
in our desire to protect people who are at risk , and to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ cla@@ mption , or even a pro@@ test for quality of life that they expect , we have to ad@@ mit that we don &apos;t actually have to lay the window for somebody that someone is actually dis@@ ab@@ led .
maybe this is the concept concept that only represents what &apos;s in a broken , and how we re@@ pair that , for every one positive dis@@ ruption than the path@@ ology itself .
if we don &apos;t treat a person extremely , and not percei@@ ve all of its forces and opportunities , we create and recogni@@ zing , in addition to the natural fight that you might have to lead , another disease .
we num@@ b a human who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the pat@@ ology and concent@@ rate on all the real@@ m of human possibilities .
but most importantly , there &apos;s between the perception of our in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cy and the great inven@@ tive spirit , a connection .
we should not face or be@@ at these challenges times , we should not try to avoid it , nor we should not try to avoid them , nor we should go to the car@@ pet , but it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing the opportunities .
i &apos;m probably trying to make sure that to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to cross law@@ li@@ ties , but that we &apos;re open , you &apos;re hu@@ mili@@ ate , you &apos;re hu@@ mili@@ ating , you &apos;re sle@@ eping at , and maybe even dan@@ cing with it .
and maybe we create it to en@@ h@@ ance as something natural , informa@@ tion@@ ing and useful , and don &apos;t feel that way by their pres@@ ence .
this year , we cele@@ br@@ ated the 200@@ th birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , expres@@ sed something very true in the human character .
i would put it this way : not the most powerful of his species , and not the most intelligent of its kind , but the one that can ada@@ pt to changes the best .
confli@@ cts are made of creativity .
it &apos;s not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of man to survive and to thri@@ ve , lies by the struggle of the human spirit to turn itself through confli@@ cts .
so , again , change and custom@@ i@@ zation are the greatest quali@@ ties of the human .
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re cutting when we really get to be dre@@ am@@ ed .
perhaps that is that the sense of ad@@ v@@ ance , a sense of the bee@@ f , a sense of our own power@@ s .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give am@@ und@@ ali@@ ties a new meaning that goes beyond the sever@@ e times .
maybe we can look at res@@ pir@@ ation as change .
ridi@@ c@@ tivity are about a change that we haven &apos;t com@@ pres@@ sed in yet .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve en@@ counter@@ ed ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
what &apos;s normal -- who is normal ?
there is no normal one .
there &apos;s the common . the typical . but not the normal one . and would you really know this poor , gra@@ y person , if you really had ?
i don &apos;t think so many times .
it would be great if we put this paradig@@ m of normal versus another possibility of a possibility or strength that could even deliver it a little bit more dangerous , and so we can rele@@ ase the forces of lots of kids , and invi@@ te them to bring their particular and valuable cap@@ ability into the society .
sau@@ pol@@ s found out that we have always challen@@ ged people from the partici@@ pants of our society : to be prob@@ able and to contribu@@ te .
there is evidence that the ne@@ anderth@@ als already have to have older people and people with sever@@ e physical in@@ ju@@ ries and people with sever@@ e physical in@@ ju@@ ries , and this might be because the life experience of this people was more valuable for society .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as broken and us@@ eless , they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago i went to the town i grew up in a food market in the nor@@ the@@ ast of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania in pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing in front of a key@@ note to@@ ma@@ to .
it was summer , and i had a ju@@ t .
and i hear a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that wasn &apos;t ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i turn around , and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; exc@@ use me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember her . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw it , i went away from the bel@@ ly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so the one .
and of course , it &apos;s done butt@@ on .
that was dr. ke@@ an , a man who i &apos;d just known from narra@@ tives of my mother , because i , of course , typical , had come to late my birthday for two weeks .
the doctor for te@@ at@@ at@@ al diagno@@ stics of my mother was in vac@@ ation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not .
and because i was born without wa@@ de legs , and my feet were direc@@ ting them , and i just had some to@@ es on this and some to@@ es on the other foot had to be over@@ sha@@ king , this stran@@ ger had to deliver the bad news .
he told me , &quot; i had to say to your parents that you &apos;re never wor@@ thy of , and never so moved as well as other kids , or that you could never live an independent life , and since they pun@@ ished me lies . &quot;
really extraordinary me , i felt that he raised exten@@ sion sti@@ ps of my entire childhood , whether i won with a letter competition in the second class , whether i had won my sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship or one of my ath@@ le@@ tic peri@@ ods in the par@@ ade , whether i had my sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship or one of my ath@@ func@@ tions to teach his students , medical students from teaching his students , medical students from the ha@@ h@@ ne@@ man medical school and the her@@ s@@ hey medical school .
and he called this part of his cur@@ ve the x factor , the potential of the human wel@@ f@@ are .
you can &apos;t deal enough how cru@@ cial this factor can be for a human &apos;s quality of human life .
and dr. ke@@ an said on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t get told anything else , and even if they get a little help , if you leave kids to their children , then kids can achieve a lot . &quot;
you see , dr. ke@@ an has changed his thinking .
he had understood that medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone could lead with it , are two different things .
and also , i changed my thinking over the time , if you &apos;d asked me at the age of 15 years , whether i &apos;d had my pro@@ s@@ thes@@ es for legs of meat and b@@ ones , i would have been a second child .
i didn &apos;t want to act at that at all .
if you ask me about that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this is what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not even this experience .
and perhaps that transformation could also happen , because i &apos;ve come to so many people who have opened me do@@ ors , rather than fac@@ ing people who wanted to im@@ press me , or have an idea to demon@@ strate .
you see , it really takes one person to demon@@ strate to you how they can mani@@ fest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow it to activ@@ ate your own inner forces , the human mind is so re@@ com@@ men@@ ded -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment opening a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them how to open up their own do@@ ors .
the actual meaning of the word &quot; the web &quot; cor@@ ses in the word &quot; comm@@ ce . &quot;
it means to set up something that &apos;s potential to s@@ ni@@ il the potential .
again , what kind of potential do we want to call up ?
in the 196@@ 0s , the case study was condu@@ cted a case study , and then tri@@ m@@ by@@ asia were trans@@ formed across entire schools .
they call this &quot; exten@@ sion &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; tracking . &quot;
students are divi@@ ded according to gra@@ des .
and the a student is te@@ sted ni@@ cer , they get better teachers , and so on .
they then gave over a three-@@ month period of students with a &quot; enough &quot; in a three-@@ month period of time . they were told they were very smart , and after those three months , they were really written .
and of course , it pe@@ ak@@ ed you the heart that the im@@ posed student was told , they &apos;re just suff@@ i@@ cient .
and of course , after the three months , it was also .
but only those that still were in school -- bes@@ i@@ des the students who &apos;d thro@@ wn the school .
cru@@ cially cru@@ cial in this study , the teachers weren &apos;t den@@ ished .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something changed was changed .
they just said that the students are the ones , and that &apos;s the students , and that &apos;s enough , and so they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real dis@@ ability is a broken mind who has been broken , has no hope anymore . he doesn &apos;t find any more beautiful . he doesn &apos;t find our natural , chil@@ th@@ ful curi@@ osity , and our in@@ na@@ te ability of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human spirit to continue to find , to find itself and other people around them beautiful , curious and om@@ in@@ ous , we &apos;re really posi@@ tively enga@@ ged in our power@@ s .
if a mind has these quali@@ ties about these quali@@ ties , we can create a new reality and new frame@@ work .
i want to end with a po@@ em that was reve@@ aled by a per@@ si@@ an po@@ et called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , and the po@@ em is called my friend jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows only four words , not the god of the women , but the god who only knows four words and repe@@ ats it all over : come , come with me . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re currently right now ?
so to imagine , i said , by a few changes of your genes , a better memory can have -- pre@@ cise , more , and faster .
or want you want to have whe@@ ter , more stron@@ ger , have more power .
would they want to become attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ dent ?
what would it be like to live in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those that always en@@ counter@@ ed for more creativity .
which would you re@@ f@@ are the most ?
which would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity education .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably so many as you are there are creative people .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would op@@ te for a positive memory ?
well , a couple more .
what would it be about fit@@ ness ?
a couple of less .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
ah , the majority . i like to look , as a doctor .
if they could have just one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all occu@@ pris@@ ing ?
or is it possible we might be possible ?
evolution is a continu@@ ous top@@ ic here at the ted conference , but today i &apos;d like to give you the idea of a physi@@ cian to the theme .
the great gene@@ tic@@ ist in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . au@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a develop@@ ess in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , wrote a paper , with the ti@@ tle , &quot; nothing in biology makes no sense except in the re@@ wer@@ s of evolution . &quot;
now , if you are one of those that doesn &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time of shif@@ ting your hearing , take your personal communic@@ ations -- i &apos;ll give you per@@ mission -- and maybe you can take a look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos; book , which is about being wrong , because nothing in the other part of the speech will make you a sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , this is just about the past , is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it true for others , or is it possible to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of des@@ per@@ ation in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , all exi@@ sting objects on the spi@@ ces of these bran@@ ches has success in evolutionary terms : they survi@@ ved ; it has been demon@@ strated to its environment fit@@ ness and strength .
the human part of this bay , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we bran@@ ch from a common ance@@ st@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , maybe 20 or 25 different kinds of friends were perhaps 20 or 25 different kinds
some of them came and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite separate from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , in the largest part , the fundamental mechanis@@ ms of our cells are pretty much the same .
do you realize that we can use that and the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insu@@ lin , which is used to treat the protein of human insu@@ lin that &apos;s used to treat the diab@@ e@@ tic ?
this is not like human@@ insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemi@@ cally in@@ different from what comes out of the pan@@ cre@@ as .
and as we talk about bacteria , you can realize that each of us in our gut leads more bacteria than it leads cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think if ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o questi@@ oned on your own image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonder@@ fully hospit@@ able environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s hot , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s we@@ t , it &apos;s very powerful .
and you &apos;re going to be all going to offer you all the nutri@@ ents you might just wish without to offer them .
it &apos;s really a easier path for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal break@@ through@@ s of un@@ inten@@ ded , je@@ od@@ step forced up to the ex@@ act nature .
but else , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria as well as they &apos;re important for their life .
they &apos;re helping with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um in a spe@@ z@@ ari@@ a ?
or are we certainly being done something else -- something that might even be adap@@ ted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s step back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first evidence of living , maybe three to four billion years ago on the earth -- the first general organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which has eventually sha@@ ped in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
in this huge un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life is only measu@@ red on earth , the animal king@@ dom , like a single ring , and of human life , a little no@@ del@@ ing .
so we were .
this is also showing the entertain@@ ment value of this speech , so i hope that d was bought you .
now , when i was a lat@@ re@@ ging in college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and the beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution &apos;s power , and i set out something very fundamental : in most the existence of life in light organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is continu@@ ed to be combin@@ ed in both to@@ ods cells .
but at the time , as a multi-@@ cell@@ ular number of organisms , things began to change .
so sexual re@@ production is in the picture .
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of the sexual re@@ production , which is the genome , the rest of the body is em@@ it@@ ting .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ table of our bodies in evolution is at the same moment as the sexual re@@ production of our bodies .
now i have to conf@@ ess when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reas@@ on@@ ably at that time , but with every year , it &apos;s gone to my growing dou@@ cles .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , who introduced his show in las v@@ eg@@ as in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .
and one night , there &apos;s a boun@@ cing on his hotel door .
he op@@ ens the door .
before him , a gor@@ ge@@ ous kn@@ ame sho@@ w@@ boy is a beautiful s@@ light .
she looks at him , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
i came to the reali@@ zation as a physi@@ cian that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily confli@@ cting , not very different .
i tried to preser@@ ve the body .
i wanted to keep sa@@ vor@@ ing .
i wanted to re@@ build the health after a disease .
i wanted to live for a long and healthy life .
evolution is about the pas@@ sing of the genome to the next generation , custom@@ i@@ zation and survive generation after generation .
from an evolutionary stand@@ point , you and i developed like bo@@ ster rock@@ ets to send the genetic questi@@ oning to the next level , and then left it to the sea .
i think we would all be the mo@@ od , the al@@ dy allen recogni@@ zed , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve an im@@ mor@@ ty through my work .
i don &apos;t want to do it by dying . &quot;
evolution isn &apos;t necessarily the lon@@ gest life to pre@@ fer .
it wasn &apos;t adverti@@ sing the biggest , the stron@@ gest or the st@@ res@@ s@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
evolution is communic@@ ated the creatures that pre@@ ach@@ es the best to its environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survi@@ vor and success .
on the bottom of the ocean are bacteria that are affected ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and so if fish were there , if fish were there , there would be vac@@ u@@ um fish co@@ ated , so they would make it a habit@@ asi@@ ble environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look back , what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and most of the time , as we anti@@ fer to the next line , i would say that there is a set of possibilities .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to continue .
we &apos;ve reach@@ ed some kind of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
and the reason that it would be that we were fir@@ stly by medicine , was to recei@@ ve a lot of genes that would have been cho@@ sen , and it would have been re@@ moved from the population .
and second , we as a species have con@@ calcul@@ ated our environment so that we &apos;ve gotten it to ada@@ pt exactly as well as we ada@@ pt to them and we ada@@ pt to them to them .
and by the way , we go around and circle and we mix so much that they can no longer say that isol@@ ation is necessary , for the evolution of evolution to find trade .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional species , of course , from the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution are kind of ma@@ turing , but they &apos;re unbe@@ at@@ able .
and as far as the ger@@ es go , if we look at planet as a species , it will be insu@@ lation and the changes of the environment that might make evolution in a natural way .
but there is a third option , a deli@@ ght@@ ful , fascinating and terri@@ fying way of thinking .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led and choo@@ sing from us as individuals in the choices that we make .
now , how did that happen ?
how could it be that we &apos;re doing that ?
let &apos;s just look at the reality that people today make decisions about their off@@ spring in some cultures .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the one and the family deci@@ des .
so think if it would not only be possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to use that body in the body that would cure disease and prevent .
what if they could make the genetic change to get rid of diabetes or to get rid of alzheimer &apos;s risk of cancer , or to elimin@@ ate bre@@ eding cancer ?
would you just want to not want to make these changes in your genes ?
if we think about it , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the rest of the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in either a year or four months .
today , you can complete a sequence of the three billion base pa@@ irs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20@@ ,000 and into the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t take long for the reality , until the reality will be , it will give the 1,000 dollar genom@@ es , and it will continue to be available for anyone .
a week , the national acade@@ my of engineering engineering awar@@ ded dra@@ per prize for fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ mmer , two scientists who developed independent techniques that encoura@@ ged the natural process of evolution to work and to wearing to have to have to have to have to have to have him called fran@@ ce ar@@ n@@ old &apos;s &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the las@@ s prize of scientists was awar@@ ded sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took a grow@@ n-@@ up skin , a fi@@ bro@@ bla@@ st , and through the manipu@@ lation of just four genes that in@@ duced cell to take them to a plu@@ ri@@ po@@ tent stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially can become any cell in your body .
these transforma@@ tions are coming in .
the same technology that makes the human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that not only prote@@ cts itself from itself , but also helped imm@@ unity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study in the form of v@@ acc@@ ine against influ@@ enz@@ a that has been built into the cells of a to@@ b@@ ber plant .
can you think of something good that &apos;s coming from to@@ bac@@ co ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , there will be a lot more possible .
now , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what would you be if you could change the cells of your des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts ?
what if they could change the sper@@ m and the eg@@ g , or the fres@@ h@@ y eg@@ g to give their children a better chance for a healthy life -- elimin@@ ating the diabetes , re@@ move the cro@@ m@@ li@@ li@@ ty , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be heal@@ thi@@ er kids ?
and then the analy@@ tical technology , the same engine of the science that can en@@ able change to prevent disease , could also provide us to adop@@ t ever@@ -@@ e@@ yed at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capacity -- the better memory .
why not the ste@@ wing order of a twitter indi@@ p , especially if you can bro@@ aden it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ ber that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer life live ?
these are going to be un@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want , we &apos;re trans@@ formed to be trans@@ formed by al@@ s-@@ style evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that usually challenges 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it to thousands of years -- and maybe even in the next hundred years .
these are decisions that have to deal with their grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children to deal with .
let &apos;s use these decisions a society that &apos;s better , the more successful , the more friend@@ ly ?
or are we going to choose sel@@ ec@@ tively different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want to have for some of us , and not for other of us ?
will we be a society form more becoming more contro@@ versi@@ al and more uni@@ form@@ ated , or ro@@ sy and diver@@ th@@ while ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
and the deep@@ est of all , are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and speak the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these choices ?
in the best as in bad , and earlier as you might think , these decisions will lie on us .
thank you .
so i want you to imagine , now , a port@@ able robot that gives you human ability , or another , the wheel@@ chair workers , helps to stand up and go up .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics , these robots call ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
they &apos;re not something else as something that you put in the morning and give them extra strength , and that will continue their speed , and that will help you keep thinking of your balance .
that , in fact , is the true reach of human and machine .
but not only that -- mel@@ ting and conne@@ cting yourself with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers , standing on average about 100 pounds on his back , and there is a question of wan@@ ting to wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- re@@ al-@@ in@@ j@@ ury , 30 percent of it -- chr@@ onic re@@ in@@ ol@@ e@@ ments .
so we thought we &apos;d take this challenge , and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ase that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introdu@@ ce you now h@@ ul@@ c -- or human photo@@ pattern car@@ rier .
sol@@ d@@ at : with the h@@ ul@@ c@@ i ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can wear 200 pounds over different ter@@ rain , many hours of .
its flexi@@ ble design allows us to cal@@ m deeply deeply , to warm and to create very high-@@ repli@@ p@@ ously see@@ cing mov@@ ements .
it makes what i want to do , where i want to go and then raise my strength and per@@ sever@@ er .
we &apos;re so far , with our industrial part@@ ners this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that year .
so , here &apos;s the true .
now , let &apos;s fit our eyes on the wheel@@ chair user , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 6@@ 8 million people who sit in the wheel@@ chair in the wheel@@ chair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the over@@ all population .
and this , indeed , is a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury that in the b@@ old time of their lives -- 20@@ under , &apos; 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- were hit by dest@@ in@@ y , and the wheel@@ chair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , which is multi@@ pli@@ ed .
and it &apos;s pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a brain stri@@ p , or for other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since what i have to say , very successful introdu@@ ction .
so we felt that we could start to write a completely new chap@@ ter in mo@@ bility .
let me now introdu@@ ce you to bee@@ anda , who was paid by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel , who suff@@ ered a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury in 19 years ago , issu@@ ing that she could no longer walk for 19 years and so far .
thank you very much .
like i said am@@ anda , am@@ anda is our chi@@ be .
it &apos;s got sensor@@ s .
his fully non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s in the need@@ t@@ les that send signals back to our on@@ bo@@ ar@@ d computers that &apos;s atta@@ ched to here on their back .
here also is bat@@ ter@@ y pac@@ ks , the motor@@ -@@ drive is on your hi@@ p , as well as on your k@@ ne@@ ck@@ es that are moving forward in this fairly smo@@ oth and very natural ge@@ ar .
i was 24 years old and in the best form , when a mon@@ og@@ nant p@@ ar tree broke me up during a sk@@ et@@ ch .
in the fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my be@@ ck@@ ens .
not long after step , a doctor went to my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you will never go back . &quot;
and this is 19 years ago .
he &apos;s ri@@ ding every five hop@@ es from my consciousness .
adap@@ table technologies have been able to learn me since to go back , to clim@@ b again , and to clim@@ b and even drive with the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again until now .
thank you very much .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet and to disc@@ uss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the entire potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the wheel@@ chair players , but all the wheel@@ chair players .
thank you very much .
at home in new york , i &apos;m cha@@ wn of the develop@@ mental department of a non@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin &apos;s strength .
if i don &apos;t fight poverty , i &apos;m fighting as a fire@@ man &apos;s man@@ ager in a volunte@@ er di@@ vor@@ ce the fire .
well , in our city , in which volunte@@ ers spon@@ sor@@ ed a highly sk@@ ill@@ ed emotional fire , you have to be quite early at the ti@@ p to be able to participa@@ te with each other .
and i remember my first she@@ et .
i was the second volunte@@ er on the ti@@ p , so i had a fairly good opportunity to take in .
but still , there was a race against the other volunte@@ ers to reach the man@@ ager man and to figure out what our tas@@ ks would be .
when i first found the main man , he was just in a very serious conversation with the prison ow@@ ner , who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the dor@@ thou@@ se and bar@@ e@@ foot under a screen out in the flo@@ wing rain@@ forest , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunte@@ er who was just following me -- called him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- got the main man first , and was asked to go to the house and was asked to save the dog from the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds .
the dog ! i was for@@ mer@@ ly proud .
there was some law@@ yer or cre@@ ator ste@@ wards , who now was now for the rest of his life , people could tell people that he went into a burning house to save a life , just because he was faster five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next one .
the main man win@@ ds me to himself .
and he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you have to go to the house .
you &apos;ve got to go up , you &apos;ve got to go up to the fire , and get some shoes this woman . &quot;
i swe@@ ar it .
now , not exactly what i was hop@@ ing to , but i went down -- the sta@@ irs up , down the hall@@ way , on the &quot; real &quot; fire@@ men that at that time , were pretty f@@ ed to the cro@@ pping room to get a pair of shoes in the bedro@@ om to get a pair of shoes
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i wor@@ e my pre@@ y back to the top where i met the front of my ne@@ d@@ my and the belo@@ ved dog .
we put our esti@@ mates out to the dom@@ esti@@ c state , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his far attention has gotten more attention than i did .
a few weeks later , the fire@@ doctor received a letter of the hou@@ se@@ hold , in which they wor@@ e the bra@@ ge operation for the res@@ cu@@ e of their house .
one about all adop@@ ted kin@@ dness : somebody had even put her a pair of shoes .
both in my career of ro@@ bin &apos;s brain and my side career , as a volunte@@ er fire@@ man , i am wit@@ n@@ essed of gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness in lar@@ ge-@@ scale scale , but i also see happiness and mu@@ ce of individuals .
and do you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around this room and see people that either reach@@ ed a pen@@ it@@ able success , or on their way there , i want to offer some of the feedback : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for you to make a difference in someone else &apos;s life until you &apos;ve reach@@ ed your first million million .
if you have something to give , you &apos;ll give it now .
you put them in a sou@@ dy kitchen , you &apos;re ti@@ ming a park in the neighborhood
may you be a ment@@ or .
not every day will be a chance to save someone &apos;s life , but every day we give us the opportunity to change one person &apos;s life .
so put it on ; let &apos;s save the shoes .
thank you very much .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mar@@ l , come back .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ve just come back from a community that knows the secret of the advan@@ c@@ ence of humanity .
a place where women lead the regul@@ ators , with sex &apos; hell@@ o , and the game determin@@ es the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not square you or san francisco .
ladies and gentle@@ men , their famili@@ ar@@ ity .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the under@@ fore@@ sts of con@@ go .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are with chimpanze@@ es with our clo@@ s@@ est living rela@@ tives .
that means we have a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
well , ch@@ im@@ ps are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ve vi@@ bility .
but unfortunately , we have this aspe@@ cted of this thing in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the me@@ d@@ al .
while chimpanze@@ es are led by big , star@@ ving fel@@ lo@@ ws , the bon@@ o@@ bo society is led by em@@ power@@ ed fe@@ males .
they know that really , because it leads to an extra@@ ordin@@ arily toler@@ able society , where killed by le@@ th@@ al violence has not been noticed .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least known among the pri@@ mates .
they live in the thi@@ ck of the con@@ gol@@ ese capital , and they &apos;re just hard to see the obser@@ vation .
con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the ar@@ rest of a violent argument that has been deser@@ f@@ ted for decades and has led almost so many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction of destruction is also saving the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s survive .
meat performance and the re@@ ar@@ range of the c@@ ables takes it , you couldn &apos;t even fill a sta@@ dium with the bon@@ led bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even there we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a bor@@ der lau@@ ghter that the trees are sh@@ ining .
who are these rela@@ tives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; mon@@ keys , because they have common , also bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ble sex , with relationships part@@ ners , and rules so confli@@ cts and social issues .
now i don &apos;t say that would be the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because life of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s is more than the pen@@ a su@@ tra .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like people -- like to play their life for a long time .
play is not just ham@@ gam@@ s .
for us , and it &apos;s vi@@ tal to the power of relationships and the care of toler@@ ance .
and with that , we learn about trust and the rules of the game .
play en@@ han@@ ces creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behavior , diversity of behavior .
and if you look at bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the game , you see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human sal@@ es , dance and ritu@@ als .
play is the thri@@ t that kee@@ ps us .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique foot@@ age from the wil@@ der@@ ness .
first a ballo@@ on on bon@@ o@@ bo@@ a man@@ art -- and i don &apos;t think of foot@@ ball .
so what we see here is a young female and males in a tracking game .
take a look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of , &quot; she would put him in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
yeah .
so , sex@@ es are con@@ fer@@ red , both in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and human people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea of ide@@ ity with which you bring new elements into play -- like the te@@ stes -- and also how the game invol@@ ves both trust and encoura@@ ges -- while at the same time , how the game does .
but the game is a form of sha@@ ch@@ makers .
play is a sha@@ ch@@ der , and there can be a lot of shapes that some people are slightly quie@@ t , fan@@ ti@@ ful , curious , curious -- maybe to discover the amazing .
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she plays pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful with water .
i think just as you play alone , we sometimes play alone , and we look at boundar@@ ies of our inner and ou@@ ter worl@@ ds .
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that makes us explor@@ ing and interact , and the un@@ expected conne@@ cts that we create are the real nutri@@ tions of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s give us into our past and present in our past .
but they also affect a myster@@ y for our future , a future where we have to ada@@ pt to growing challenges , through greater creativity and prin@@ ting co@@ operation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adap@@ ti@@ re-@@ jo@@ ker .
so to ada@@ pt to an un@@ fortun@@ ate world , we have to play .
but are we going to do the best out of our play drive ?
play is not sil@@ ly . &quot;
it &apos;s essential .
and bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and people , ex@@ tend to be life is not made of teeth and cla@@ ws alone .
at the same time , if it doesn &apos;t seem , play is the most important thing to do .
and so , my pri@@ mate hol@@ ders , let &apos;s rever@@ se this gift of evolution and play together , while we re@@ discover the creativity of the cau@@ te@@ dness and the mar@@ vel .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pa@@ irs , in the mi@@ d-@@ 197@@ 9 , exactly the same day , in the same moment , every single one of the baby -- okay .
so two pa@@ irs , every case of a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the stuff , because if you &apos;re thinking all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
just think of that for a moment .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , you imagine that in a case the sper@@ m car@@ ries a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m , which hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m man@@ ages a x chromo@@ some that hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
they &apos;re both aff@@ fish , they &apos;re un@@ able .
we still come back to these people later .
and in most of my activi@@ ties , i have two be@@ ats .
bene@@ ath a hat i &apos;m talking to the story of an@@ atom@@ y .
i was a histor@@ i@@ cian , and in this case , i study how people with an@@ atom@@ y went to -- was like human bodies , animal bodies , animal bodies -- as they moved with blood flu@@ ids , with body concep@@ ts ; how they thought about body .
the other hat that i wear at my work is the activ@@ ist , as a perman@@ ent law@@ yer -- or , as i sometimes say , as im@@ patient law@@ yers -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have body types , questi@@ oned social nor@@ ms .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are si@@ am@@ i tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with ad@@ minister grew -- people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with inter@@ sex people whose sex at@@ yp@@ ic -- so people who are not showing the ordinary male or female body guy .
and as a separate term , we can use the word inter@@ sexu@@ ality for that .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality is in a lot of different forms .
i &apos;m just giving you a few examples of the kind of sexual type of sexual vari@@ ants that don &apos;t meet the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have somebody with a x@@ y chromo@@ som@@ le , and the s@@ ry gene on the y ch@@ om@@ o@@ silk leaves the proto@@ bub@@ ses that we all have in the stage of te@@ ans@@ al sta@@ dium .
and that &apos;s why the te@@ stes give off in the fe@@ der@@ al strat@@ an te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
but because of this individual , the re@@ cep@@ tors are missing to dete@@ ct the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , respond the body not to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and that &apos;s called and@@ ro@@ gen@@ re@@ cep@@ tor@@ -@@ de@@ fe@@ ct .
so a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to that .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more of a typical female course .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl .
but it mostly takes them to pu@@ ll pu@@ ber@@ ty and grow their brea@@ sts and develop , but they don &apos;t get their time until somebody comes to that , is a little different .
and they do some tests and find out that instead of ir@@ oning and u@@ ter@@ u , they actually have te@@ sti@@ cles in it , and they have an y chromo@@ some .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually think that person could be male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our body that you call ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ ets .
they &apos;re in the back of our bodies .
and the middle kid@@ kee@@ pers hi@@ re and@@ ro@@ gens , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
most women , as i am -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromo@@ som@@ es , but i think i probably don &apos;t , but i probably think i &apos;m probably the typical -- most women like i actually talk to and@@ ro@@ gens .
we make ro@@ bes , and we talk to and@@ ro@@ gens .
the ep@@ iso@@ de is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was more ex@@ posed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than a woman who was born with ho@@ her@@ men and has a and@@ ro@@ gen re@@ cep@@ tor .
so gender is really complicated , more complicated , more only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , you can be spread over all the band@@ wid@@ th .
another example : a few years ago , i received the phone call of a year-old man who was born as a boy , when boy educ@@ ated , he had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , lived as man , and he just found that he had just been o@@ vi@@ sti@@ es and a u@@ ter@@ us .
he had an extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te side b@@ it hyper@@ b@@ ie .
he has x@@ x chromo@@ some , and in the wom@@ b , his next kid@@ ne@@ ys were so highly active that you basically have created a male hor@@ m@@ um surro@@ unded .
and as a con@@ sequence , its gen@@ it@@ al male were em@@ ph@@ ated , his brain was the typical male part of the hor@@ h spectrum of the horse spectrum .
and when he was born , he saw himself like a boy -- no one was doing something .
and only when it was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was men@@ stru@@ ed in open@@ ly that the doctors discovered that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a vari@@ ation of inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , something called o@@ 0 est@@ is is being surro@@ unded compar@@ ing with the o@@ vari@@ an pul@@ su@@ es of ho@@ d@@ tis@@ us .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so , sex can occu@@ r in a lot of different vari@@ ations .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s a pe@@ ak@@ er , or si@@ am@@ i tw@@ ins , whether it &apos;s inter@@ sexual -- of surge@@ ons a lot of times to the nor@@ m , is not because this is for their physical health of advan@@ tages .
in a lot of cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
the reason why they often are made different kinds of surgery is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
now , typically , our system is based on the idea that a particular an@@ atom@@ ic agre@@ ement is acting with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to be a female identity ; to be a black person , is to be , desire to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of your story .
so we have this terri@@ fying simpli@@ stic idea .
and if we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body , which for us is actually very different , it &apos;s conf@@ using us in terms of these categ@@ ori@@ zations .
so , in our culture , we have a lot of roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism .
and our nation is really based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individual corruption .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , who are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve seen for most of my exc@@ it@@ ement , south african sei@@ ders ka@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya was asked last year , whose gender was challen@@ ged in the city of the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship in ber@@ lin .
a lot of journ@@ alists called me the question , &quot; what are you going to do that tell us is whether bi@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is white or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journ@@ alists that there wouldn &apos;t be this test .
we now know that sex is difficult enough that we have to ad@@ mit that nature has no line between male and wis@@ ly , or between male and inter@@ sexual and soft and spi@@ ritual and emotional and inter@@ sexual , we are it to the ex@@ tent that this line line is as of course .
so we have this situation , where the continu@@ es of our science , we have to ad@@ mit to so much more that these categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve decided to build for stable an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories , which are made very simple to create perman@@ ent identity produ@@ ctions to be much shar@@ p knowledge than we &apos;ve accep@@ ted .
and it &apos;s not just sex@@ y .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be much more difficult than our ter@@ min@@ ology .
in our search , we were reach@@ ing in all kinds of un@@ comfortable terri@@ ties .
we &apos;re taking , for example , the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
what are we going to start with with the fact that we &apos;re just different from little nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
as we continue to push our science deeper and deeper , we become increasingly in a zone of embar@@ ras@@ s@@ ment , where we have to recognize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve had to be ast@@ on@@ ishing .
we see that in all sorts of different real@@ ms of human life .
one of the areas that we see this to the right , in our culture , in the united states today , are the struggle of the beginn@@ ings and the end of life .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about what &apos;s going to be a body to people , so he has a different right than the fe@@ tus .
we have very difficult differences these days -- maybe not as publi@@ c@@ ly in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors previ@@ ously had never been so hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
they had someone holding a fe@@ a@@ ther under the nose , and when they moved , they didn &apos;t bur@@ y them .
if they didn &apos;t raise it , you bu@@ ried them .
but today , we are in a situation where we take people of vi@@ tal organs and we want to nur@@ se other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re thro@@ wing ourselves in the fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation , where we don &apos;t have as simple categ@@ ories as we used to .
now you may sus@@ pe@@ ct that all of the categ@@ ories of categ@@ ories would make someone really happy to do .
i &apos;m pro@@ gressi@@ ve , poli@@ tically , i defen@@ se people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit , it makes me feel nervous .
to understand that these categ@@ ories are really much more inse@@ cure than we thought it was en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed .
and it in@@ spir@@ es me in terms of cop@@ i@@ ons of democracy .
so to tell you about this at@@ titude , i have to dis@@ agree first that i &apos;m a big fan of fo@@ der@@ ing fa@@ thers .
i know they were ra@@ ti@@ on@@ ts , i know they were more sex@@ y , but they were great .
i think they &apos;re so bra@@ ve and strong , and so radical , where they did that i &apos;m going to look at all of all the many years to see the ex@@ act com of 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten .
it &apos;s because of what 17@@ 7@@ 6 has done with the fo@@ der@@ ing fa@@ thers .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were in my view , the original an@@ atom@@ ic activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why .
what they measu@@ red was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and they put it through another that was radi@@ cally and beautiful , and 200 years of meas@@ ur@@ ing us .
as you all remember , our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers passed the concept of the mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was consi@@ der@@ ing a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
the world &apos;s ap@@ sters didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
they had a concept of blu@@ e-@@ blood .
they believed the notion that people who had political power should have this political power , because of the percei@@ ved blood line from the grand@@ father to the son and so forth .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers dec@@ lar@@ ed this idea and set it through a new an@@ atom@@ ic concept , and this concept said that all people have created equ@@ ality .
they ni@@ vel@@ ed the game field and decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , they coun@@ ted common , not the differences , not the differences . and it was very radical .
now they made that part , because they were part of an el@@ ev@@ ate system where two things were growing together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time also scientific education grew .
if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ alist world .
they went away from explan@@ ations of super@@ -@@ natural species , and they follow things , like a super@@ natural concept of power , where the trans@@ mission is based on a very va@@ gue concep@@ ts of birth right .
they were moving to a moral concept .
and if you look at the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
it &apos;s talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and in that part , they were able to give us an idea that was designed by an@@ atom@@ ical diver@@ gen@@ ce .
and so , in a really wonderful way , you &apos;re ready to hang the future of civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it as this , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened for years after that ?
for example , women used the elec@@ tions who com@@ part@@ ment@@ ed the ele@@ ction , the concept of the fo@@ under@@ s , which says that an@@ atom@@ ic common@@ ness is more important than the an@@ atom@@ ical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and a &apos; difference , that we should not have the vot@@ ing , the right to whole govern@@ mental citizens , the right to own , etc . &quot; etc . &quot;
and women were successful doing that .
the next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like so@@ es of colors sp@@ elling on it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the mar@@ ting hall@@ s of burn motion , saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
again , people of different skin color that are working on an@@ atom@@ ic diver@@ sity against an@@ atom@@ ic differences .
we see the same with the dis@@ ab@@ led legal movement .
of course , the problem that , as we start to look at all the common matters , we have to start asking questions why we susta@@ in certain tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s .
now , well-@@ consci@@ ously , i want to keep certain dis@@ actions , an@@ atom@@ ically seen , in our culture .
for example , i want to not give a fish the same rights as a human man .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from the an@@ atom@@ y all the way .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-@@ ol@@ ds should have the right to be having sex or to mar@@ ry their care .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ic op@@ posi@@ tions that make sense to me , and that we , i think should hold .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we &apos;re holding them , and whether they &apos;re meaning@@ ful .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been viol@@ ated at the beginning of the speech .
we &apos;ve seen two creatures , both in 197@@ 9 , at the same time .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , three months ago , she was born , so she was born on jun@@ e 19@@ 80 .
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born the eleph@@ ant , so he &apos;s born at the one mar@@ ch in 19@@ 80 .
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia was born three months of record , they all got them all right in three months before h@@ ein@@ rich -- the right to have income , the right to choose , to drink the right to drink .
h@@ ein@@ rich has to wait on all of this , not because he actually has a different biological age , only because of the ti@@ tle of his birth .
we find other od@@ ties of what their rights are .
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you assu@@ me that it &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the conversation -- because you assu@@ me that it &apos;s male , he can now be put in , now he can &apos;t appreci@@ ate what mar@@ ia has to do .
mar@@ ia , not in all states , can &apos;t percei@@ ve the same thing , the h@@ ein@@ rich in all states , and that &apos;s the right to mar@@ ry .
h@@ ein@@ rich can ju@@ dge a woman in each state , but mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman in a few states today .
so we have these dur@@ able an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories , which are proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able in many ways .
and for me , the question : what will we do is , our science makes such progress in an@@ atom@@ y , that we get a point where we have to reach a point that does we need to ad@@ mit that a democracy that does an@@ atom@@
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels sometimes as though science makes its own sense of its own
so , where do we go ?
it seems like our culture might take some kind of pra@@ g@@ matic post@@ ure , &quot; well , we have to pull a line somewhere , so we &apos;ll pull it out somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are dro@@ pping in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas at a point decided that if a man is to mar@@ ry , you don &apos;t have y chromo@@ some , and to mar@@ ry a woman , you say you have a y chromo@@ some .
now , in practice , people don &apos;t get te@@ sted on their chromo@@ some .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re , because of the history i started telling you about the and@@ ro@@ gen re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
when we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king off@@ ers us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of a solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be ju@@ g@@ ged people to &quot; their skin color , &quot; but to ju@@ dge its character of its character , and it goes beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
and i &apos;d like to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate people based on their person@@ ality ?
i &apos;d also like to point out that i &apos;m not supposed to share rights in the minds of people , because i have to ad@@ mit that i know a series of golden re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s that probably deser@@ ves so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n benefits than some people i know .
i want to tell you that i probably know some bright lab@@ el lab@@ s , the more capable are more sophisti@@ cated , more intelligent and ri@@ fer decision with your sexual rela@@ tions than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that i know .
so , how do we address the question of the characteri@@ stics of character surgery ?
it turns out , it turns out it &apos;s really tough .
and part of me said , what if the content of a person@@ ality is something that would be in the future -- that could be made in the f@@ mr@@ i visible in the future through the f@@ mr@@ i
do we really want to go in that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to think about questions about question about democracy .
in our ur@@ ge about democracy , we &apos;ve been doing our thing really well , and i think we would do our thing in the future well .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for instance , where it &apos;s the case in iran , where a man who has sex sex@@ ually to other men is pun@@ ished with death , it unless he &apos;s willing to sub@@ mit a sex@@ ually trans@@ version , which is what he can never live alive .
and the conditions of these kinds of us are not there .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say that we didn &apos;t have this situation -- a surge@@ on that i spoke a few years ago , who had brought some si@@ am@@ i tw@@ ins with some si@@ am@@ i tw@@ ins to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name to a name .
but when i spoke to him , and i asked him why he made these sur@@ ger@@ ies -- it was high risk sur@@ ger@@ ies -- was his answer that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and so he had to do it .
i said to him , &quot; well , you &apos;ve launched political as@@ yl@@ um instead of surgery instead of separ@@ ating it ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be that they are , without having to change about the state .
so i think that &apos;s what we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to find that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fa@@ thers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy might look like , or if we could have been involved more if we have any more enga@@ ged .
and i want to say something that &apos;s radical for a fe@@ min@@ ist , and i think that there may be different ways of insi@@ ght that affec@@ ts different kinds of an@@ atom@@ y , especially when people are appl@@ ying a group thinking .
for years , for years , because i was interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i was interested in research in gender related .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and how they operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- are almost everybody , but on the average -- more often , complex social rela@@ tions and the people who are vulnerable in the group to give very much attention .
and that &apos;s why when we think about it , we have an interesting situation ahead .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , one of my class@@ mates asked me to know my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i looked at myself as fe@@ min@@ ist , so do it still -- a really terri@@ fic question .
he said , &quot; tell me what fe@@ min@@ ism is fe@@ it@@ ant . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most au@@ rate question i &apos;ve ever heard .
fe@@ min@@ ism is about solving stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , so at fe@@ min@@ ism is nothing fe@@ t@@ ant about fe@@ min@@ ism .
but the more i thought about his question , so much so that i thought that there was a little bit of female in fe@@ min@@ ism .
that means to have something , there could be something on average , where female brains of male difference that are paying us paying attention to complex social rela@@ tions , and paying attention to the pro@@ of needs for the pro@@ of needs .
so where the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were extremely concerned to find out how individuals could be prote@@ cted before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we interven@@ ed more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re fu@@ el@@ ing a concept , not just how to protect , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future when we do democracy about an@@ atom@@ y -- less about the individual body to think about what identity in terms of relationships , and thinking more about relationships .
so that if we as people try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public obs@@ ession , and that is : i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
and i love to find every chance of learning a different color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit , and also photograph@@ ing and blog@@ ging in time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i &apos;m going to get all my clo@@ th@@ es from second hand on fle@@ v@@ ands and in the like hand@@ -@@ hand@@ s .
thank you . thank you .
care@@ com sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the influence of my cla@@ ss to the environment , and also to my wal@@ k@@ market .
i &apos;ll meet all kinds of amazing people , my consumer , for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to buy to my very personal mus@@ bing .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to have my hei@@ ght ?
am i going to like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all of the answers yes , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and tell me what i &apos;ve pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does somebody get with so many of the out@@ f@@ its ?
so i &apos;m going to show you very pre@@ cis@@ ely what i brought with .
i brought seven hours of supp@@ res@@ ses , and that &apos;s all .
inter@@ se@@ il@@ es for exactly one week are everything that i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case .
i made a fir@@ e that i would want to wear everything i might want to wear , if i came to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
and because she &apos;s not hearing me than the woman who &apos;s walking around here at her under@@ wear -- it means that , i &apos;ve found some things .
and i &apos;d really like to show you my out@@ f@@ its for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i think you believe or not , have learned from these ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ s , has to contribu@@ te to nothing new .
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
i call this the wh@@ el@@ ing tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look at great .
you can almost always look really well for less than 50 dollars .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , has cost me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece that i had enjo@@ yed this whole week .
mon@@ day : color is a little bit of a vi@@ cious .
it &apos;s almost physi@@ cally impossible to be mis@@ er@@ able when you wear bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;ll reduce other happy people .
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ tation is going to be completely over@@ -@@ challen@@ ged .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life to try to be myself myself , and to ada@@ pt myself at the same time .
just be easy who you are .
if you surro@@ und yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to esti@@ mate .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
sometimes me , people say to me , i watched clo@@ th@@ es &apos; games , or i remember their se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
i love to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : self-@@ confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking into something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not going to look in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me for day this day .
but it wasn &apos;t until i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to put that brie@@ fly for you brie@@ fly .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and exp@@ and@@ ing a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no exc@@ use for anyone in this audience .
we should be able to ro@@ ot what we want .
thank you very much .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : gold pa@@ il@@ ing agre@@ ement to everything .
and finally , satur@@ day : a self-@@ , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world a little bit about one , without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me whenever this week people came up to me , just because of what i was wearing , just because of what i was wearing , and i had fab@@ ul@@ ous conver@@ sa@@ tions .
obviously , this is not going to fit everything in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate this all again .
because the lesson that i can try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to get rid of it .
i don &apos;t have to feel emotion@@ ally fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , because right around the corner , it will give you another crazy , color@@ ful , ra@@ w out@@ fit that just waiting for me when i have a little bit of love in the heart and it &apos;s looking for it .
so thank you very much .
thank you very much .
well good after@@ noon , everybody together .
i have something that i &apos;d like to show you .
think of this as a frame of view , as flying image .
this is what we call in our lab , per@@ cep@@ tual design .
so let me tell you a little bit about this .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m origin@@ ally itali@@ an , and every young in it@@ al@@ y is growing up with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that in the for@@ mul@@ a , in the past decades , something very interesting happened .
it was that , a while ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 , you took your budget , and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they would win the race .
so today , if you want to win a race , in fact , if you want to win , actually look at the car in real time , have some thousands sensor@@ s , the information from the car , that information comes out of the car , and then process it and then use it to send back to that car and change things in real time while information is colle@@ cted .
this would call you in engineering teams , a re@@ al-@@ time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made from two parts -- a kind of a custom@@ i@@ zing part and a pres@@ enter .
what &apos;s interesting today is the real age systems are beginning to appear in our lives .
our cities have been equi@@ pped , just with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics in the last couple of years .
they become computers in free .
and as a computer , they start to act in a different way , they start to be felt and prop@@ ell@@ ed .
when we make cities move , that actually is a big thing .
just , by the way , i &apos;d like to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population there lives .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy -- they gain up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something about the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all pull out all this and em@@ power@@ ing all of this into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that pa@@ iled pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i for mom@@ a later , in the summer , in the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; having me with me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , are beginning to speak to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om is going to be out there , a sen@@ sor and a pus@@ tain .
and it &apos;s radi@@ cally different the interaction that we humans have with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as though the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , as mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sha@@ ped the mo@@ ses , it says that he took the ham@@ mer at the end , and she thre@@ w it on mo@@ ses -- you actually can &apos;t see a little spot on it -- and said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you do you don &apos;t bring a little ?
well , today , our environment begins for the very first time to answer ourselves .
so i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and driving .
let &apos;s start by looking at it .
so the first project that i &apos;d like to show you is actually one of the first early of our lab@@ s .
it was developed four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and what we &apos;ve done here was actually used a new kind of network that &apos;s been put in the world -- this is a mobile tele@@ phone web and anony@@ m@@ ent and ag@@ gre@@ ch@@ ed information out of this network that &apos;s already colle@@ cted from the das@@ ner to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was when it@@ al@@ y won the soc@@ cer world c@@ up .
some of you may remember was , it was played as it@@ al@@ al for fr@@ ance , and then the zi@@ dan@@ e ends up , the head go@@ at .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y , at the end has won .
now , look at what happened that day , only during the obser@@ vation of the activity that happens in the network .
here they &apos;re looking at the city .
you look in the middle of the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um , the flu@@ ver .
in the morning , in front of the game .
you can see the ti@@ mel@@ ine up on the top .
in the old after@@ noon , people here and there , who are making the calls and move .
the game starts -- sil@@ ent .
fr@@ ance is doing a tor . it@@ al@@ y makes a tor .
hal@@ f-@@ time , people do a short call , go to the toi@@ let .
second half . end of the normal play time .
first exten@@ sion , number second .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in one moment of the head co@@ at .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
now , at that night , everybody went to the center to celebra@@ te .
they saw the big ex@@ pos@@ ure .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the taliban for the taliban and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture about the place to about co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since the ro@@ pe time , people go to celebra@@ te -- to have a big party , and you see the impact at the end of the day .
now , that &apos;s just one example of how we feel the city today , in a way like how we couldn &apos;t have a few years ago .
just very quickly , here &apos;s another example of this : this is not about people , it &apos;s about things that we consu@@ me and consu@@ me .
now , now we know everything about where we come from .
this is a map that you see all the chi@@ ps from all the chi@@ ps that a ma@@ c computer is like how they came together .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
so in this project we actually designed some little mark@@ ers to pur@@ sue the g@@ arb@@ age as it comes through the system .
so we started with some volunte@@ ers who were using us , a little more than a year , in se@@ attle to tag things that they wa@@ ped away -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw away anyway .
and then you have the little chi@@ ps , the little br@@ ands , bus@@ y pa@@ gs on the tr@@ ash and start to pur@@ sue it .
so here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve just got .
from se@@ attle ...
after a week .
and with this information , we realized that there are a lot of in@@ efficient in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data wasn &apos;t available at all .
but that &apos;s what a lot of counter@@ intui@@ tive weather happen and complicated things .
the other thing that we believe is that when we see that , if we see the c@@ up that we throw away , it doesn &apos;t just go away , they still don &apos;t disappe@@ ar anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re still sle@@ eping away every day .
and if we would show that to the people , then we can push a behavi@@ oral change .
so , this is the reason for this project .
my collea@@ gue , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , who , could percei@@ ve a lot more about that and the many wonderful things that you can make with , tell me , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we discus@@ sed in the beginning , and that is the em@@ ph@@ as@@ is of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in sam@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
it started with a ma@@ yo@@ r question , who came to us , and said that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition in public places to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that was dest@@ ined at mit was , imagine these di@@ vor@@ ces , and val@@ ves , magnetic val@@ ves , me@@ net val@@ ves , spe@@ ams that open and close .
it causes something like a water cur@@ tain with ima@@ gery from water .
now , when these points falls down , you can write on it , you can write patterns , images , text , text .
and you can walk him , and it will open up to let you fli@@ p through it as you can see in this picture .
now , we pres@@ ented the ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ hole .
he was very pleas@@ ed to him .
and we got the mission to design a building at the built of the exp@@ o .
we called it the digital water of pa@@ car@@ li@@ on .
the whole building was covered out of water .
there are no do@@ ors or windows , but when you walk down , it will open up and let it put you in .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s win@@ dar@@ y , if you want to lower the inje@@ ction , you can even rele@@ ase the roof .
or you could close the building and be able to close the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this day , when you drive down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building . &quot;
no , they don &apos;t get destro@@ yed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappe@@ ared .
and here you can see the building working .
you can see the person who &apos;s going to wonder what happens in the inside
and here , you can see me , when i was trying to test the sensor@@ ings of sensor@@ s that open the water , not getting we@@ t .
now , i should tell you what one night was going to happen as all the senses stopped to work .
but actually , it was an even more fun job during that night .
all the children from sam@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because they played the building , because the way they played with the building was very
no longer a building that would open open to you , but a building that had still brea@@ ks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting we@@ t .
and this has been , for us , very exciting , because as architec@@ ts , engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people who use things that we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always inno@@ va@@ stat@@ able .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and inter@@ acting with the people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical images , the images of water , and the proje@@ ctions on it .
and this is what led us to thinking about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine this figu@@ d@@ ding of ima@@ ging could really start flying .
imagine you could have little heli@@ cop@@ ters that fly through the air , and each one of you with a little corner of the same thing with fli@@ tan light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
so here &apos;s the video .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter like the one you saw earlier , which moves with others , totally syn@@ chr@@ ony .
you can have this clou@@ ds .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble display or display , like this -- an exten@@ sive forma@@ tion in two dimensions .
or ir@@ regul@@ arly , however , in three dimensions , in which what changes is the light , not the location of ima@@ ging .
they can play with different kinds of ways .
so imagine from the screen could just appear in different forma@@ ts or size , in different compu@@ tes .
but then , then , all of a sudden you could be just a 3d cloud of images that you can go to and through which you can look through them from many , many direc@@ tions .
here &apos;s a real fl@@ y@@ whe@@ el controll@@ er that dro@@ ps down to form an iden@@ tical operation like previ@@ ously before .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so the same way we &apos;ve seen it before .
so imagine that each one of the people is driven .
there could be every single object that has a impul@@ se that comes from people , from the mov@@ ements of people or something like that .
i &apos;d like to just show you something here first .
we worked with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- to the ga@@ box at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york , and the sc@@ ala in mil@@ il@@ and -- we took his mov@@ ements in 3d to use them as a impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fir@@ es .
and here you see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you see the ima@@ ge-@@ shared images that are different ones .
it &apos;s simul@@ tane@@ ously a re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan and a mov@@ ement .
so they can rel@@ ate to the whole movement .
you can do it all the time .
but then , once we have all the images , you can play with it , and with color motion , and dra@@ g motion .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a potential impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fir@@ es .
i &apos;m going to show you the lat@@ est project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olymp@@ ics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the clou@@ ds .
the idea is , again , imagine that we again assem@@ ble the people to do something and change the environment -- almost as what we call it , to build clou@@ ds of clou@@ ds like you move a sche@@ sh@@ er , but with a cloud .
imagine if anyone can give a little don@@ ation to a point of view .
i think the remarkable thing that happened for the last few years , the last decades is that we &apos;re changing from a physical world to a digital world .
that has all di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , knowledge , and it &apos;s making it acc@@ essi@@ ble through the internet .
today , we can for the first time -- and the campaign of the admini@@ am@@ as has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-@@ organi@@ zing forces of networks to the physical world .
it can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that means something which is built in the city .
but tomorrow can it to ask us the challenges -- think about the climate change , or emis@@ sion emissions -- how can we then change from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually integra@@ te the people in which they together are together , colle@@ c@@ tively .
the cloud is again a cloud of images in the same way , in the same way that a cloud of particles is made of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of ima@@ ging points .
it &apos;s a physical conc@@ ern in london , but photograph@@ ies covered with ima@@ gery .
they can move inside , and they can do different kinds of experience .
you can actually look at it from underneath , the most important moments for the olymp@@ ic 20@@ 12 and beyond it , and it &apos;s as a way of conne@@ cting to community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something at the top can go to it , like london &apos;s new meters of the mountain .
you can walk into it .
and a kind of digital light at night -- but as most most important , a new kind of experience for anyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important with context .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to tell you that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is inter@@ connected .
the first time i was in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , i was in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ berg .
i re@@ main a@@ wor@@ ing .
my heart ra@@ ste , i was thri@@ ll@@ ed , as i was trying to express what was on front of me .
the ice mountains around me , almost 60 meters out of the water , and i could just hin@@ t that this s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke was on another s@@ no@@ w@@ tail , year year after year .
ic@@ e@@ berg is born as a cal@@ f of a gl@@ aci@@ er , or brea@@ ks out of ice sh@@ ates .
every ice mountain has its own individual person@@ ality .
they interact in meas@@ ures with their surro@@ und@@ ings and their experiences .
some people re@@ tain and kn@@ ine up and shu@@ ttle up to the bit@@ ter end , while others don &apos;t prevent it and dis@@ coura@@ ge in a fit of dra@@ matic passion .
when you look at a ic@@ e@@ berg , you think easily that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , separate and alone , just as we humans often see people .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a ice mountain mel@@ ts , i &apos;m in the process of setting up its temporary atmosphere .
during the ic@@ e@@ berg , he &apos;s rele@@ ased glam@@ al-@@ fabri@@ c drin@@ king water that fe@@ e@@ ds a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my foot@@ age of these ic@@ e@@ berg as if i were to make portra@@ its of my ancestors , in the awareness that they exist in these individual moments of this sort , and never become inst@@ used again .
it &apos;s not a death when you mel@@ ting ; it &apos;s not the end , but it &apos;s a continu@@ ation of your path on the life cycle .
some of the ice in the ice mountains that i &apos;m zo@@ om@@ ing is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures that i &apos;d like to show you , showing a ic@@ e@@ berg that i brian brian in ke@@ dor@@ t@@ su@@ at@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
very r@@ ar@@ ely , you will actually be we@@ e@@ ding of a roll@@ ing ic@@ e@@ berg .
so here it is now .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you see a little boat .
this is at about five feet long .
i want you to watch the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg , and where it &apos;s on the water@@ line .
you can see here he starts to roll , and the boat moved to the other side , the man is there .
that &apos;s the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg .
it ra@@ ces about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time in real time .
and just like this , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different side of its person@@ ality .
thank you very much .
my life is really ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ably bl@@ essed by work on some amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is en@@ vel@@ op@@ e .
temp@@ tly was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ sts in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
and then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs cri@@ b@@ b@@ able . &quot;
and that was the er@@ up@@ tion of it .
temp@@ t@@ fully , this is all completely paraly@@ zed .
he can only use his eyes .
i was fac@@ ed to him .
i have a company that &apos;s doing design and anima@@ tion , so gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably a complex part of what we look and look at in the art of the art .
so we decided , tony -- stop -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father , and his brother , and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i &apos;m only going to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back to him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t it -- i &apos;ve seen ste@@ phen haw@@ king -- can &apos;t communicate all paraly@@ zed people through these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard the higher status layer and have a remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , you can really do it .
ordinary people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how are you appl@@ ying now ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &quot; bu@@ tter@@ fly and closed details ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how your fing@@ ers are working .
i was like , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how could that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just put a check , and instead i instead , i rele@@ ased a check , which i didn &apos;t have the easi@@ est idea of how i was going to resol@@ ve it .
i connected myself in place , and i direc@@ ted through his brother and his dad -- and i said , &quot; well , my pro@@ pos@@ al is this : &quot; tony will talk , we &apos;re going to motiv@@ ate it a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way to make his art again again .
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that somebody who &apos;s carrying all this doesn &apos;t communicate it . &quot;
so , i spoke at a conference a few months later .
i met these folks from gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light to any surface , and then draw with a las@@ er poin@@ ter that will regi@@ ster the negative space .
so they &apos;re moving around and doing mor@@ ally instal@@ lations like this .
they &apos;re saying that all of the things that are up there are following a life cycle .
it starts with sex , then the sc@@ u@@ ries , and the bush re@@ a@@ ders , the bus@@ h-@@ re@@ a@@ ders , and most recently , people actually make art .
but there used to be a life cycle in their pres@@ entation .
so i went home and i dinner with my wife , and i went to tell her of all , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to control your eyes to control things , we should find a way that rate can ste@@ al a las@@ er , so that he can make gra@@ ff@@ iti again , it would be brilliant . &quot;
so that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of back and forth , we &apos;ve reach@@ ed some things .
first , we &apos;ve called the in@@ sur@@ ance the do@@ ors , and we actually get a device for temp@@ ting a device that it can communicate with -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ k@@ ing machine .
that was un@@ belie@@ vable .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so un@@ comfortable , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we &apos;ve flo@@ wn seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally from all the cor@@ ners of the world -- literally from all the cor@@ ners of the world -- for us .
my wife , my kids and i went to the garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ti@@ sts and con@@ spi@@ cts , and con@@ gr@@ sts took our house .
many of our friends thought that we were nice to do this , and that we would re@@ cover , and we all came back , and all the images on the walls would be gra@@ ff@@ iti .
but for over two weeks , we progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the beach team in ven@@ ice , my children were involved , including my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ phili@@ zer , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought on the be@@ ach@@ ing of ven@@ ice , some vel@@ per wire and some stuff out of the construction market and the electr@@ on@@ ics .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , we put it out , put it on a led light , and now we &apos;ve got a device that &apos;s open -- you can build it yourself , we can put it in itself , we can put the code free , the software you can down@@ load free .
so we have created a device that is completely fre@@ ely free of limit@@ ations .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can be roll@@ ed .
no hospital is also not a hospital
whatever , now , any paraly@@ zed can actually communicate with his eyes alone with your eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to speed rooms .
and i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s now all this sha@@ m@@ p before the great un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , zer@@ cin@@ ism and elimin@@ ated , tony dre@@ w , for the first time again , re@@ covered after seven years .
and this is an amazing image , because this is his life support system , and he looks out about his life support system .
and we tou@@ ched his bed so it can see outside .
we put a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the par@@ king pat@@ ch in front of the hospital .
and he first dre@@ w again , in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was in the par@@ king lot .
unfortunately , we also had to collapse into the par@@ king lot , so we were perfectly comfortable as a part of the electr@@ on scene .
so what he did at the end was he told us an email saying , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve dra@@ wn something .
i feel that i was drin@@ ked under@@ water , and finally somebody thre@@ w up to the bottom and raised my head so i can brea@@ the . &quot;
isn &apos;t that hyper@@ -@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
that &apos;s kind of like our ta@@ il@@ -@@ be@@ ater .
that kee@@ ps us on the meeting , and we keep developing more and more .
and we need to improve a lot about this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s got a magic ch@@ art like that .
and someone who has one such arti@@ cal potential is deser@@ ves so much more .
so , we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
since then , we have all given all kinds of notice .
we won a few a@@ wards .
think , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve it .
it comes out of our own po@@ ckets .
so the brea@@ ks were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
arm@@ strong ball@@ dre@@ ced about us and then , in dec@@ ember , the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine told us the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine as one of the 50 best inven@@ tions in 2010 , which was really great .
the cool@@ est of this is -- and this inclu@@ des the whole circle -- that this apri@@ l , in down@@ town mo@@ ca in down@@ town los angeles at los angeles , will give a exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and there may be so much the tou@@ gh@@ est repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives of the street art scene -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ ws -- all these boys will be there .
sur@@ ely , to be part of the show , which is quite re@@ lie@@ ved .
so , this is what i &apos;m about to do : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ ering -- everything was impossible at the time .
do it -- you &apos;ll all be here .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i had never done anything with exchange resol@@ ution technology , but i just figured out something and surro@@ unding me and surro@@ unded me with amazing people together so we could put something on the legs together .
and that question should be subje@@ cted every single day , every single day when something sees you something that has to do something that needs to do it , if not now , when then , who else ? and if not i , who ?
thank you very much .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably american &apos; white children &apos;s book auth@@ ority .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come to a scientist like this .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ ther , but no one has ever cho@@ sen dinosaurs .
today i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations .
well , an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve dro@@ pped it somewhere somewhere .
you go around the block and you take it as a re@@ fri@@ it .
this is a painting of a cir@@ cular thing .
one of my friends has done it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ es .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of what i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 6@@ 0s at high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the class@@ pi@@ g .
i was the person who was be@@ aten every week in the virg@@ ine@@ o bed , green and blue until a teacher was saving my life .
she saved my life by giving me the toi@@ let in the teacher &apos;s room .
that &apos;s what she was doing .
so she did it for three years .
and i had to get away from the city .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and it ble@@ w me to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and at the time in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i found it important to record a work in aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i had a phone call from this teacher , woman po@@ sts , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as an adult .
you can come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please come up with the guy that i know you found me in the beginning .
and i should say that i have cer@@ e@@ al cancer , and i want you to stand up . &quot;
now , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we cr@@ our@@ ed , and we knew that they needed to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
we found one for them , we put them in , and we took care of them , and we gave up their family eight because it needed to be .
it was something that we knew to do .
and as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , she met into a box full of ash , and was put in my hands .
what has happened was that the circle closed , it was become a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation that i talked about was .
the re@@ vel@@ ation is that death is a part of the life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ed y@@ ours of y@@ ours .
and , you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs everything .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that this has been mentioned today this many times .
he needs the same -- he needs to need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving us these things .
thank you very much .
so , imagine a big explosion while you clim@@ b up to a thousand feet .
think of a plane full of smo@@ ke .
imagine a ta@@ x software that you imagine , the click , bla@@ p , b@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
this sounds fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed .
well , i had a unique place on that day ; i was sitting on 1@@ th .
i was the only one who could talk to the air@@ line .
so i looked at them the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ll have a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already organized the machine , and we didn &apos;t go so far away .
you were able to see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot was direc@@ ted the machine after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
this is not usually the rou@@ te .
it &apos;s ligh@@ ting the ta@@ x .
so , imagine a no@@ is@@ y airplane .
and then he said three words -- the tou@@ ch@@ able words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; make all the sha@@ ke . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bri@@ d@@ als .
i could see it in their eyes , there was bre@@ ed , life was to end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me that day .
i learned that there is anything different in a moment .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to make a hand , and it didn &apos;t work , all the rules that i wanted to do , all the experiences that i wanted to do , and i never did .
when i was thinking about it later , a phr@@ ase that is , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is so far , and the person is there , i &apos;ll open it .
i don &apos;t want to fli@@ p something more in life .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that goal , changed my life really changed .
the second thing that i learned that day -- and that was , when we gave the george washington bridge , pretty much about hair &apos;s bor@@ ders -- i thought , &quot; ge@@ ar , there &apos;s one thing i really re@@ gre@@ t .
i &apos;ve had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i sc@@ ur@@ red to become better in everything that i pal@@ ped .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my e@@ go room .
and i had the time that i was wa@@ sting for meaning@@ less things , i hat@@ ed people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfe@@ ct , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t mention myself with my wife for two years .
it feels fab@@ ul@@ ous .
i don &apos;t try to have a right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this time , when the inner clock ran , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; ... &quot; down
you can see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please sho@@ g in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to be broken in 20 parts , as you know from docum@@ ent@@ ary .
as we fell down , i had this feeling of man , to dying , is not terri@@ fying .
almost as if we prepared our lives to do it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sa@@ dness really conf@@ used in a thought , which is that i &apos;m just one thing wi@@ sh@@ ing .
i wi@@ shed that i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after after@@ wards , i &apos;m atten@@ ding my daughter -- first gra@@ ders , not a lot of arti@@ stic talent ...
... yet you don &apos;t .
and i &apos;m cr@@ ying , i &apos;ll wine like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was a sense for me .
i realized that it was clear then by putting the dots together , that life is all about a great dad .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life to be a good par@@ ent .
i became the mira@@ cle that wasn &apos;t going to die that day .
i got another present gift to see in the future and come back and live and live differently .
my call to all of you who are flying today is : imagine what &apos;s going on on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it ; and guess it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that you cut up , because you think you &apos;d always be there forever ?
how would you change your rela@@ tions and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , you are the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind sta@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want the iran to build the bom@@ b .
the most important pop there for development of nuclear weapons is the ur@@ ani@@ an in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ation institution in or@@ ance .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes that you see here , these are re@@ al-@@ time contro@@ ls systems .
so if we &apos;re going to com@@ pre@@ mic the systems that sp@@ are out businesses and control the val@@ ves , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
these gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do that there &apos;s an effective win@@ dow@@ s-@@ based virus on a laptop that &apos;s used by a volunte@@ er engineer to con@@ form this gra@@ y box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and that &apos;s the design behind the stu@@ x@@ net .
so we &apos;re starting with a windows ves@@ sel@@ s .
the production data are trans@@ fer@@ red into the gra@@ y box , deci@@ ding the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the ir@@ ani@@ an energy program -- ac@@ com@@ mo@@ zed brie@@ com@@ mission
it &apos;s a car game , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;d like to tell you how we found that .
when we started to stage our research six months ago , six months ago was completely un@@ known of what the purpose and purpose of this con@@ struc@@ tor was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the hun@@ m part , the nar@@ sh@@ ing part , he made entirely nu@@ o@@ - da@@ y@@ - sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ds .
and it seemed to be something that appe@@ ared with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , this re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
that appe@@ ared our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and we looked at this constru@@ ct .
and then something com@@ ical happened .
sta@@ x@@ net was like a lab that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- he sm@@ ell@@ ed his che@@ ese , but didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
and after experim@@ enting with different kinds of che@@ ese , i went forward to know that this was a pain@@ t@@ led .
completely refer@@ red to a particular target .
the drug ten@@ der is thri@@ ving active on the gra@@ y box , when a special con@@ figu@@ ration was dete@@ cted , even when the special program that &apos;s trying it to infe@@ ct it on this target .
and if it &apos;s not , it will be st@@ x@@ net .
so , this really caught my interest , and we started working with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could , say , for example , we are a us@@ - 90 power station , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we have to get better at what the target is .
so , extra@@ cted , and de@@ com@@ pos@@ ing the attack , we found that it was struc@@ tured into two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they built very profession@@ ally , by people who obviously had all the inside of the inside information .
they knew every single one and d.@@ ed that they had to attack .
they probably knew they knew the sho@@ e si@@ zes of the machine contain@@ ers .
so they were all known .
and if you &apos;ve already got the dro@@ ps of sta@@ x@@ en complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , the user data are a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisti@@ cated than anything that we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you &apos;re going to see a clip of this attac@@ king code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned mu@@ son@@ es .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this co@@ co@@ st .
so , what we were looking for first systems were called systems , because we know what they were doing .
and then we looked for subje@@ cts and data , and try to connect this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these tar@@ gets that we could repli@@ cate or dis@@ placed or dis@@ placed .
so to make these theor@@ ies , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely not high-@@ gra@@ y s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it has to act about a high success , and very likely it &apos;s in iran , because there have been most infe@@ ctions in iran .
well , in this region , there are not several thousand tar@@ gets .
it basically goes out to the bay volu@@ me nuclear power plants and on the ur@@ in@@ ity plant in tanz@@ ance .
so , i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; get me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ts and power plants from our cli@@ ent . &quot;
and i called them and i war@@ ped her knowledge to compare their exper@@ t knowledge with the what we analy@@ zed in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so we were able to connect the little digital shel@@ ket with the ro@@ pic@@ -@@ controll@@ ing .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tat@@ ing , you can actually be able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor , and eventually even elimin@@ ate the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
and what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slowly and not get it slowly -- clearly in that decision , to let war@@ ware engineers des@@ f@@ end , so they couldn &apos;t be able to get out to get behind .
the big digital explo@@ head -- we got a look at it by looking very pre@@ cis@@ ely with data and data .
so , for example , the number 16@@ four text very quickly out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
i began to work with scientific liter@@ ature , about how this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge is built in stal@@ ance , and found that they &apos;re struc@@ tured in what &apos;s called the cas@@ in@@ ca@@ des , and every be@@ at con@@ tains 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ts .
so , that made sense , it com@@ bine .
and it got better than that .
this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge in iran is divi@@ ded in 15 called what it looks called .
and guess what we found in the code of the ang@@ er@@ ie ?
it &apos;s an even iden@@ tical structure .
so again , the fit@@ test really well together .
and that gave us great confidence for the one that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
these results were achie@@ ved by several weeks of hard work .
and often , we just ran into a stop@@ spring , and we had to re@@ collect ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital hou@@ se@@ heads in fact head@@ ed in reality and the same goal , but out of different direc@@ tions .
the little was@@ head takes over a cas@@ ca@@ le , and it conver@@ ls the ro@@ tors and slo@@ ws it down and the big was@@ head is acceler@@ ated with six cau@@ li@@ es in interaction and decisi@@ on-@@ me@@ bes .
so , in the majority of all , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we actually have realized what the goal is .
it &apos;s or@@ ance , and it &apos;s just or@@ an@@ tee .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets could be hit by st@@ x@@ net .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- poin@@ ted reality out of the so@@ cks .
there &apos;s the gra@@ y box , and up at the top you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
now , what this thing does is that it takes the lo@@ west values of sensor@@ s -- so for example , of pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s -- and it sets legi@@ ti@@ mate code that still even is running during the attack , with the wrong data .
and in fact , this fal@@ se data of data has already taken place from stu@@ x@@ net before .
so it &apos;s just like hollywood movies where the sur@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce is , where the sur@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce has ever f@@ ed recor@@ ded video recor@@ dings with recor@@
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea here , of course , is not just to monit@@ or the machine operating user in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
and the idea is to over@@ come a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine provi@@ ders can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power plant , for example , when the great ste@@ am tur@@ bine becomes too quick , you have to open re@@ lief plan@@ s within milli@@ seconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
so this is this time we need digital security systems .
and if those are thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , they can happen really bad things .
the power plant starts to explo@@ de .
and nei@@ ther the hard@@ ware leaders , or the security system will notice it .
this is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
but it gets worse than that .
and what i &apos;m talking about now is very important .
think about it . this for@@ ec@@ t is gener@@ ic .
it doesn &apos;t have anything specifically with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , with ur@@ ani@@ um sequ@@ ance .
so , for example , it would work exactly as well -- in a power plant or in a car factory .
it &apos;s pl@@ ent@@ y .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the ow@@ ner -- you don &apos;t have to get the use of us@@ s on a us@@ b@@ - key , as we saw in rich@@ x@@ net .
you could also use regular com@@ bat technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and if you do that , you end up getting a cyber@@ mass wea@@ pon of mass destruction .
this is the con@@ sequence that we need to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attac@@ ks don &apos;t go in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe , and japan .
so all these green regi@@ ons , these are the most tar@@ ble environments .
we need to figure out the consequences , and we have to start prepar@@ ing ourselves better .
thank you .
i &apos;ve got a question .
r@@ al@@ ph , it became a lot of it repor@@ ted that people sus@@ pe@@ ct that the mo@@ s@@ mas is behind the main organization .
so is that important to your mind ?
all right , you really want to know that ?
yeah . all right .
in my view , the mo@@ s@@ mic involved , but the driver &apos;s strength is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the cy@@ ber super@@ power .
there is only one and these are the united states -- fortunately , lucky .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for bre@@ eding us of cure . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
i spent the last couple of years building in situations that are usually difficult and also some dangerous , and also some dangerous , sometimes
i went to ja@@ il -- hard .
i &apos;ve worked in a coal min@@ ing -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve been fil@@ ming in war -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying not to eat anything -- fun at the beginning , a little bit hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i particularly have the most part of my career subje@@ cting to terrible situations , and it &apos;s all just for trying to explore social practice so that they &apos;re comp@@ elling and interesting , and hopefully reas@@ oning in a way of understanding what they &apos;re enjo@@ ying for the audience and being entertain@@ ed .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew that i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard of it that i jum@@ ped an ad on e@@ bay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent some facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter news , and i gave people the possibility to get the name of the name of my ted@@ talk 2011 . 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son is never going to leave again -- the aff@@ air rights to the talk that you &apos;re just seeing , which wasn &apos;t a ti@@ tle at that point even a lot of content , and not giving a lot of evidence about what the subject would be .
so what you got was this : you said , your name : my ted@@ talk , you have no idea what the top@@ ic is going to be , and that ever , after all , could fly you through the e@@ ars , especially when i had their company for your invol@@ vement .
but apart from it , it &apos;s a very good medi@@ al opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these ted@@ talks ?
quite a lot .
by the way , this is just the working ti@@ tles .
so despite that cli@@ ren@@ cy , i knew that anybody would buy the name of the name .
if you had asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say to you this was to say this with you
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , commer@@ ci@@ als .
as i said , i &apos;ve been in some pretty awful situations in some pretty awful situations , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing else could come to me to go to something as difficult and as dangerous as with these guys .
you know , i &apos;ve had the idea for a movie .
so what i want to do is a film about brain stimu@@ sions , marketing and adverti@@ sing , which fund@@ ed all the film is fund@@ ed by pieces of expression , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
and the movie will be called &quot; the star wars of the film . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the star first sight , &quot; is that everything , from above to bottom , is completely contain@@ ed with br@@ ands to the end , which is from the eleph@@ ant spon@@ sor that you &apos;re going to see in the film , that &apos;s mar@@ k x .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ e@@ com@@ m sta@@ dium , the sta@@ ir@@ y center .
these people will be connected to the movie in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty -- forever .
and so , the film becomes explor@@ ing this whole idea -- this is what ? in the e@@ ter@@ us , for always ?
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
that was more about em@@ ph@@ as@@ is .
it was &quot; in e@@ ter@@ ty , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a user spon@@ sor , we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;re going to sell every possible categ@@ ory in the movie .
so maybe we &apos;re selling a sho@@ e , and he &apos;s going to sell the most great sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ...
the great car you &apos;ve ever gone from , from &quot; the bottom first colors , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a awareness of &quot; the stars of the henry . &quot;
so the idea is , bes@@ i@@ des showing that brand br@@ ands are part of life , are actually to elimin@@ ate them to fund the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
so the goal of all this film is transpar@@ ency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of wol@@ ons .
so this is the whole concept , the entire film , from the beginning to end .
and i would be happy if ce@@ g would help me do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know what com@@ pi@@ ries will be people .
you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; point &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but you know how that &apos;s going to be evol@@ ving ?
how much money is going to need to realize that ?
one hundred and a half million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth any value to address some really well known ta@@ gs .
who knows , when the movie comes out , we might see like a hor@@ rier of ver@@ li@@ di@@ ots .
so what do you think the answer is going to be ?
and the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the movie , or a hard thing about me ?
j@@ k : both of them .
so , it means , not so optimi@@ stic .
so , my mr. sir , can you help me ? i need help .
so i can help .
all right .
great .
we need to think about what are the br@@ ands .
ye@@ p .
when you look at the people who you have to do to do it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
look at the camera .
i thought , &quot; take the camera out of &quot; would mean that we wanted to take a back conversation . &quot;
it turns out that it was actually meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your film . &quot;
and just like that disappe@@ ared so disappe@@ ared , one after the other .
no one wanted to have something to do with the film .
so i was ama@@ zed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing , was to present as many people as possible , to allow it to see as many people as possible .
particularly in today &apos;s world , on this inter@@ section of new and old media and the frag@@ mented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting repres@@ entation of repres@@ entation that the mas@@ ses will get this message .
no , i thought what i was thinking .
but , you see , the problem was that my idea had a f@@ at@@ al er@@ ror , and that was the following .
actually , no , that was not the mistake at all .
that would have not been a problem absolutely .
that would have been fine .
but what is there on this picture , is a problem .
see , if you put transpar@@ ency on the google search , this is one of the first images -- this is one of the first pictures that seems to be .
i like your , really , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . so .
that was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free of de@@ ception and bubble , just to discover and push through ; person@@ ali@@ zing from visi@@ bility and access to information , especially what business rates are -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re now listening to transpar@@ ency about transpar@@ ency .
our politicians say , our president says , even our ce@@ os say it .
but if it &apos;s the case that you should be imple@@ mented , something will change .
now why ? well transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ared of fear -- like this strange bear , which is still rock@@ eting .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this strange urban road .
and she &apos;s very ris@@ ky as well .
what else is it ris@@ ky ?
a whole sna@@ ke cool s@@ ne@@ p .
this is very ris@@ k@@ ant .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father got me to lie -- and he sat and he looks at this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three ver@@ sions at every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there is the real version . &quot;
so , you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there was only a company ready to help us -- and it &apos;s also because i john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ t@@ tree heard for years -- i realized i &apos;ve had to do it alone , i realized i had to deal it alone , i had to deal the midd@@ ing man and go right with my team .
so what they suddenly began to understand -- or what i started to understand was , when you start talking to these companies , was that when you start talking about these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood is a complete problem .
i have friends , the big , huge hollywood films , and i have friends , the little prototyp@@ e movies , like i do .
and my friends , the great , huge hollywood films make , say that the reason they &apos;re so successful is that their movies are so successful on the mar@@ sa@@ tions they have .
and then my friends , the little prototyp@@ e movies , they say , &quot; well , how are we going to compe@@ te with these big , giant hollywood films ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the bas@@ -@@ bas@@ son . &quot;
so , how exactly are we going to see phili@@ in the movie ?
every time i go on the way , and whenever i open the medical career , you &apos;ll see a fellow tax@@ de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
and every time i intervie@@ wed somebody , i can say , &quot; are you enough to interview this interview ?
are they out there ? you &apos;re looking a little nervous .
i want to help you to cal@@ m .
so , maybe you should have to put a little bit of this in front of your interview . &quot;
and then we make one of this great dun@@ es .
you either have fl@@ ame fusion or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise garden , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be dis@@ solved both for men and women -- soli@@ d , wheel@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
this is the short fra@@ ge .
so now i can answer all of your questions and you give them a more specific bubble .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve spo@@ ken about the smaller movies , we are a brand a challen@@ ging .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other br@@ ands .
so to do these things -- you know , people in ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
which do you know ? what would you describe ?
ban be@@ k .
this is a great question .
over@@ si@@ zed technology .
technology is not the way you &apos;re supposed to describe something that does something that somebody does under the watch .
we &apos;re talking about coo@@ ke@@ et , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this categ@@ ory really makes to a positive positive , as op@@ posed to &quot; fighting gra@@ ve and mo@@ i@@ di@@ ty . &quot;
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
how can we hold them longer for longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more cold .
and these things have a positive effect .
and this is a milli@@ onic manufac@@ tur@@ er .
what about me ? what about the prin@@ ting stick fa@@ ke ?
i have to speak to the man in the street , who are like me , ble@@ ed low-@@ cost consum@@ ers .
you &apos;ve got to tell me a little bit about my brand .
how are you going to describe your brand ?
&quot; h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
e@@ z@@ ra : i don &apos;t
i really like quite nice clo@@ th@@ es .
8@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val hits sk@@ ate sc@@ or@@ k on sk@@ ate pun@@ k , except on the was@@ h day .
all right , what is the ger@@ ry ?
un@@ belie@@ vable .
and i think the gen@@ re , the style that i have is probably &quot; far &quot; glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ y noise and stuff like that .
but usually i usually have a ac@@ id , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and such a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classi@@ c bi@@ ce@@ des ro@@ rio .
you name i am , the brand i am , i &apos;d say , smart fly .
part # 2 of hi@@ pp@@ ie , part of yo@@ g@@ i , in part , broo@@ kl@@ y@@ e-@@ girl -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the she@@ ton guy .
i sell millions of calls all over the country , in the world .
so , i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , de@@ stor@@ ted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x , because i was an a@@ kee@@ che .
guy five : scri@@ pi@@ ed un@@ failed al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ ctive scri@@ ps .
is that what ?
law@@ yer : i &apos;m a law@@ yer sign .
i &apos;m a tom .
now , we can all be the tom@@ b brand , but i &apos;m often seeing me at the inter@@ faces of fully glamour and ear@@ l@@ able flight .
and what happened was that i need to have a choice .
i needed somebody to go in my head , somebody who could really help me understand what &apos;s called the brand character .
and so , i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ oll@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
they have helped companies like nest , fe@@ at@@ u@@ ves , hall@@ mark , to discover these brand person@@ ality .
if they could do it for those , they could also help me .
you brought your images with you , yes ?
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how it conne@@ cts with your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who are designing my world@@ view .
just tell me about the world .
m@@ d : this world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- like people around one around one , the friends , the family , the way how you live your life , the work and so forth .
all these things came from a place , and they start from a place , and for me , and they start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
so , what &apos;s the next you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what &apos;s going on to the thoughts and feelings about you ?
it &apos;s as if i &apos;d like to be .
so i like things that are different .
i like things that are que@@ od@@ ble . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what is it that brings it to us
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? in what pu@@ p@@ pet , you &apos;re right now ?
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what does the red represents ?
let me tell you a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them that they are not .
which one of me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ tics have you gone through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be sc@@ ared . what kind of ach@@ er@@ op@@ on are you ?
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ a@@ e ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your pati@@ ence .
yeah . all right . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what is going to get out of this .
there were a lot of crazy things went on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that your brand person@@ ality characters separ@@ ated two , but comple@@ ted pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lo@@ ck dol@@ is an el@@ u@@ sive home game .
the inter@@ fer@@ ments are very good .
and i think there is almost a conflict with it .
and i think some companies will just focus on soli@@ d strength , rather than both of them .
many companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avoid things where they &apos;re not sure where they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re going to be sc@@ ared , these elements , and they &apos;re wel@@ drawing these wel@@ comes for themselves , and they turn them into a little positive , and that &apos;s a ni@@ ck@@ mate jo@@ ir@@ ment .
what other br@@ ands are doing so ?
the first one is a classi@@ c , apple .
and you can see it here , pain@@ tors , wi@@ i , min@@ i of min@@ i co@@ op@@ er and je@@ t@@ blue .
well , there are br@@ ands and mountains , mountains , br@@ ands , these things that come and go , but a fold , and a min@@ d-@@ hard brand is a pretty powerful thing .
an el@@ ev@@ ate , negoti@@ ated br@@ ush . what &apos;s your brand ?
if anyone would ask them to describe their brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would it be ?
you &apos;re an up@@ -@@ brea@@ thing ? are you what the blood is going to get in walls
or are they more like a down@@ -@@ whe@@ el ?
are you something that &apos;s a little bit quie@@ t , more conser@@ va@@ tive , more conser@@ va@@ tive ?
up@@ work are things that are play@@ ful , fresh like the foot prin@@ ce , ti@@ red , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , de@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , dro@@ pped and fun and mer@@ ge fl@@ yn@@ n , wor@@ thy and agi@@ le , and my@@ sti@@ cal and my@@ sti@@ cal and my@@ sti@@ cal , as que@@ al@@ f .
or are they more like a down@@ -@@ whe@@ el ?
are they quar@@ sely and mon@@ den@@ n like 100,000 ?
are they multi@@ pli@@ ed , traditional , fit@@ ing , eff@@ or@@ ting , com@@ passionate like op@@ ra@@ h ?
are you reli@@ able , stable , sav@@ vy , safe , na@@ vy , sa@@ ven , sac@@ red , sa@@ ke and way like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
in the course of the film , we had over 500 companies who were up and down companies and the no one said no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to be doing anything with this film , because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but it turns out that 17 marine part@@ ners who were willing to give up on these control that wanted to do with someone so el@@ a@@ gu@@ ous and deal with us as i , and finally , who em@@ powered us to tell stories that we normally couldn &apos;t tell -- stories that would never support a campaign .
it em@@ powered us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you today use mr@@ i today to listen to the pleasure centers of the brain , both to make ads and movies .
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o where foreign adverti@@ se@@ ments had been ban@@ ned .
in the entire city , five years since five years has no pres@@ enter shor@@ es , no poster , no fl@@ yer , nothing .
and we went to school distri@@ cts , where they have trade their way to sl@@ ack@@ y schools , across the americ@@ ns all over
the amazing thing for me is that the projects that i got the most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , these are the ones where i inter@@ ac@@ ted with things .
and that &apos;s what these ta@@ gs have done .
because they went to the medi@@ ting man , they went over the agen@@ cies , and they said that the agen@@ cies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is going to challenge our world refle@@ cts .
and how did that have to succe@@ ed ? what &apos;s positive ?
now , since the movie of s@@ und@@ ance &apos;s film was pre@@ mi@@ ered , we can see this .
according to bur@@ r@@ ari@@ an was the pre@@ mi@@ ere in janu@@ ary , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the entire thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls from this film .
this , in fact , inclu@@ des two and a 3@@ 2 weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t given up yet .
it doesn &apos;t even have it online . it &apos;s not a wh@@ ol@@ ping .
it hasn &apos;t come out in other countries yet .
well , finally , the film has got a very big time .
and this isn &apos;t bad for a project , in the almost every adverti@@ sing agen@@ cy that we talked to , to re@@ com@@ men@@ d their custom@@ ers to make money .
so one of the things that i feel really belie@@ ving is that if you pay your chance , risk is available in those risks .
i think when you keep people from it , you &apos;ll get them closer to failure .
i think that if you trained your employees to avoid risk , you &apos;re prepared to get the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that at the end of the day , we need to encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to have no fear of opportunities that they might be likely to dist@@ ingu@@ ish
finally , we should wel@@ come the fear of &quot; listen . &quot;
we should be put in the c@@ age in the c@@ age .
&quot; you &apos;re paying fear . &quot; &quot; you wel@@ come the risk . &quot;
there &apos;s a big spo@@ on full , that we &apos;re wel@@ come to risk .
and finally , we should be wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
now , more than ever before , a little bit of honor makes us a little bit of honor .
and that said , with hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my whole talk , &quot; you get rid of transpar@@ ency , &quot; they were pres@@ ented by my good friends of em@@ c , who paid $ $ 7@@ 100 for the nam@@ ri@@ gation of e@@ bay .
large data is trans@@ formed for organizations around the world to big opportunities .
em@@ c : &quot; you are wel@@ come transpar@@ ency . &quot;
thank you very much .
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency this : so what happened exactly with the $ 7@@ 100 ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my po@@ cket , exhi@@ bi@@ tion at the center of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check at la@@ titude from $ 7@@ 100 to fund my ted@@ ted@@ s for the next year .
so my name is am@@ it .
18 months ago , i did some other work at google , and i agre@@ ed to make something with muse@@ ums and art . my che@@ f@@ in , which is today , gave me green light .
and it la@@ sted 18 months .
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
there are a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
so , i think my personal vision is very simple with this slide and her access .
growing up in india , i grew up .
i became a great education -- i don &apos;t miss myself -- but i had to have too many muse@@ ums and this art doesn &apos;t access access .
so when i went to travel@@ ing , and to visit these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to make this lon@@ ging -- to make art more acc@@ essi@@ ble -- with technology .
so we created a team , a great team , and we started this with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demon@@ stration , and i &apos;m going to tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to google &apos;s proje@@ c@@ .com .
you can look around in all these muse@@ ums here .
there &apos;s the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , the mom@@ a , who is her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , van go@@ gh .
i even get in one of my favorite , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
you come up to two ways -- very simple .
and b , and bo@@ um , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you am@@ use yourself .
you want to ori@@ ent in the museum ?
let &apos;s open the map , jump it with a click .
in there you &apos;re , you want to be until the end of the final dinner .
go on . lots of fun .
pu@@ gh you .
thank you , but the best is still there .
so i am now a one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , intri@@ cate workers from sk@@ ase bre@@ w in the met .
i see this pl@@ i sign .
if the museum has given us the picture , you click on it .
so this is one of the images .
so these are all the meta@@ data .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click this away now .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve sel@@ ec@@ ted with what we call the gi@@ g@@ ster@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ -@@ technology .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion images of data , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to get for 10 billion visual points ? &quot;
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can easily zo@@ om in and you can zo@@ om out .
you &apos;re looking at something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
but then you really want to put deep down .
and so i started to play around , and i realized that something was happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to close , and i noticed slowly that these kids were actually hit@@ ting something .
i did a little bit , spoke with some known known with some known known , and actually found out that it was about a game called squ@@ a@@ il , where a piece of gan@@ de was be@@ aten on the fa@@ ke program with a stick .
seem@@ ingly it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned a little bit about it .
to really go close to it , you can go up to the ris@@ ky .
just to give you the over@@ look , i zo@@ om out so you can see what you get .
here we &apos;ve been , and this is the painting .
the best thing is still getting -- in a second .
let &apos;s just jump fast to mom@@ a , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star@@ d@@ night night .
now , in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the br@@ ush slo@@ od@@ les ?
and what &apos;s only when you want to see van go@@ gh this ma@@ ster@@ piece because create this g@@ ster@@ piece ?
you zo@@ om in . you can go in there .
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om into one of my favorite sc@@ ales of this picture until i &apos;m really in the zi@@ ke .
this is star@@ d@@ ding night , probably seen this before .
now , i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot of other , but i don &apos;t have the time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ cting colle@@ ctions .
every single one of you , every -- if rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can throw and online your own museum -- of all these pictures -- from all these pictures you can put your own colle@@ ction .
very simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om in .
this is the sh@@ and@@ ed , in the national psychiat@@ ry .
you can see them all with evidence to send their friends , and so a conversation start about what they feel when they look at these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
i think , finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful stuff doesn &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even come to me from the muse@@ ums .
i may not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience of me in hu@@ mili@@ ty for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be accu@@ rate with this digital medium of art , and pres@@ enting it online .
and the biggest question that &apos;s recently asked me is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum class ? &quot;
and the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s inten@@ ded to satis@@ fy experience .
that &apos;s what it is about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . your brain can be sub@@ divi@@ ded in two parts .
this is the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then half the right , which is the intui@@ tive side .
if we had an sam@@ ple to measure the ap@@ p@@ ph@@ ent every he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , we could show your brain .
for example , this would be somebody who is completely logi@@ cal .
this would be somebody who is completely intui@@ tive .
now , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these same discipl@@ ines , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a big ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ st that is at the same time in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ sive , or so like that .
you can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
and so i look at one person , along with the most other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good mode of lo@@ gic to add together the complex ideas together .
but then , at the same time , we need a good number of jobs to actually make the experiments .
how do we develop these intui@@ tions ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out , and we play with it , and then we look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
in fact , they do the same thing .
so one of the intui@@ tions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can only be in a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think about that one thing at the same time , but they &apos;re not born with this idea at the same time , but they &apos;ve developed it with this idea .
i remember a child watching a little kid on a floor .
he was still a to@@ dd@@ ler and not very good at it , and he was contin@@ ually fall@@ ing .
but i bet that it taught him a very valuable lesson with the floor of the thro@@ at , which is that big things don &apos;t just let you pass , and that they re@@ main in one place .
and this is a great strate@@ cially proble@@ ral model in the world , as long as they &apos;re not a single physi@@ ci@@ sts .
it would be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist because it &apos;s not with soil table , it would be with these little od@@ d particles .
and when you play with your particles , you &apos;re stuck all kinds of weird things -- like flying directly through walls , or that they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all of these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called them the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need it to describe the great common@@ s-@@ in objects around us .
that didn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate my intuition , and that may just be because i don &apos;t so often with particles .
well , i do sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
but my logi@@ cal side didn &apos;t che@@ ck it either .
because when all of the stuff are out of particles , and all these particles follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , shouldn &apos;t just be followed the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why that shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i would feel really better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show up that general objects are also following the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so , i came up with a couple of years ago to do that .
i created a building .
this is the first object that you can see that was in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ strategy .
so , what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green point there in the center .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
and this is a picture of the object .
here i got it . we &apos;re looking at the right place at the center .
and here &apos;s a really very big clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , and it &apos;s sha@@ ped like a spr@@ ing@@ board , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so , i made this thing in a similar way that you do a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new si@@ li@@ cide sh@@ ells , and i slowly te@@ sted for 100 hours on all the big hard@@ ware devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this as a swi@@ mming pool sha@@ ped hole and get the thing .
this thing has to be the ability to be in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position , but it needs a little bit of help to do it .
take a look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is in a full el@@ ev@@ ator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m even in the el@@ ev@@ ator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i get other people to , and i hear to do all these things because i don &apos;t want to hurt them , or , frank@@ ly , they &apos;re fall@@ ing .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ sensitive objects are just the same .
so the members of the in@@ tin@@ able objects are not just people , but the lights that seem to be appe@@ aring to them and the wind that &apos;s fall@@ ing on them and the heat of space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we had to throw it out of all the conversation .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
we swi@@ t@@ ched the lights , put it in a vac@@ u@@ um , and clean all the air and re@@ dre@@ sted it until almost now , just in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the piece of metal was fre@@ ely free as it wanted to .
so , we measu@@ red his movement .
and we found that it really was moving str@@ angel@@ y
instead of that it &apos;s just cal@@ m there , it was vi@@ br@@ ated it , and the way it was vi@@ br@@ ated was about as it &apos;s here -- as a radi@@ cally exp@@ and@@ ing and mix@@ ed bubble bal@@ in@@ berg .
we gave him a little push , we couldn &apos;t vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time , we could vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time -- something that could be allowed in quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so what i &apos;m about to tell you is , what really is amazing .
what does it mean to vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time , at the same time , and not vi@@ br@@ ating
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms that the piece metal is made out of the piece of metal , and at the same time , the same atoms move up and down and down
just too pre@@ cise time points , you agree .
the rest of the time , they are del@@ as@@ alized .
that means that every at@@ om at the same time is two different places , which means , at the same time , that &apos;s the entire piece of metal in two different places .
so , i think that &apos;s really cool .
it &apos;s .
and that was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , you check that , the scale between a single at@@ om and this piece metal is about just the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places , in the same time , that can be this piece of metal in two different places , then why not you ?
i mean , this is just what my logi@@ cal side says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel like this ?
how would your consciousness deal with it that your body is pl@@ enting in the room ?
there is another aspe@@ ct in history .
when we watched up the lights and looked in the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks as if all the objects are in the el@@ ev@@ ator are just artic@@ ked objects that are comp@@ iled in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is connected to everything .
now , that &apos;s not quite accu@@ rate .
there &apos;s something more about it , it goes even deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , are literally prote@@ cted who are literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and weird of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
thank you very much .
in 2007 , i decided that we should re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about it , where they want to live and to work , they &apos;re given you the opportunity to cho@@ se between at least one hand of different cities that are all in competition by new resi@@ dents .
at the moment , we &apos;re getting far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city that they would be wel@@ come .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than they cost it .
so we could just easily with the world with ridi@@ cul@@ ous , possibly even hundreds of new cities .
that may sound ab@@ sur@@ d for you now , unless you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
just type the a@@ part@@ ments to the market of the cities .
but if you think about half of the people who want to live in a@@ part@@ ments , this has already been , the other half hasn &apos;t .
they could try to exp@@ and the capacity that already exi@@ sted exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments
but you know what they would be in , to regu@@ late in these a@@ part@@ ments and their surro@@ und@@ ings to prevent and to con@@ vul@@ se from ex@@ pos@@ ure .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to get out of all these exten@@ sions .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a whole new block block , as@@ sum@@ ing the laws there would support a building and not di@@ vul@@ late it .
so i suggest@@ ed that governments create new space that car@@ ries enough space for a city , and they gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
and later i found out that , about the same time , ja@@ four and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o was thinking about the challenge of a re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year , about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ies left their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in hon@@ dur@@ as .
at this point , j@@ four to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; what happens when we stop an im@@ it@@ ant platform of our country -- what if we put it just a little bit of a given , a part of the american message , a part of the can@@ adi@@ an inter@@ fer@@ ment -- and when people want to work under the can@@ adi@@ an rules or the united states , can they work there , and can they go to the area of these mes@@ sages , what they mostly would have to go to canada , or go to america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suff@@ ered from a care@@ less solution .
in the next elec@@ tions , pe@@ stro@@ let lo@@ bo won in a tur@@ suit , whose program inclu@@ ded both new innova@@ tions and appe@@ al .
he dem@@ and@@ ed oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his big fire@@ man .
in the mean@@ time , i was looking for a talk at ted@@ global .
so , through impro@@ v@@ ements , and trying to exam@@ in consum@@ ers , i &apos;ve been trying to reduce this complicated concept of the char@@ ter city to the defini@@ te elements .
the first thing is the importance of laws , laws that deter@@ mine that you can &apos;t dist@@ ur@@ b exi@@ sting hous@@ ing .
we give new technology great attention , but for the progress needs it needs technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually the laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , the link to the ted@@ talk .
and then he showed him ja@@ vier .
the two kee@@ ps me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the front of our country ! &quot;
so , in dec@@ ember , we met in the seat room of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make clear of how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i &apos;ve used this graph to show how valuable ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york . think that there &apos;s a surface in some cases per square meter of thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstra@@ ct discussion , at a place when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , we might look at ted@@ talks . &quot;
so , the ted@@ talk put in very simple form that a char@@ ter city is a place whose initi@@ ated country is its first un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited country , a fo@@ unding contra@@ ct that exists the laws that gover@@ n people and deci@@ des people the opportunity to live under these rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , who said that we have to process this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way we &apos;re going to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come after te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ .com and give me a talk on the fourth and fif@@ th of janu@@ ary .
so i took another story with facts , who have a graph like this invol@@ ving that invol@@ ving trying to realize that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city den@@ ser , and the sk@@ et@@ ch is showing the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ ver .
the air@@ port , by the way , is 10@@ -@@ foot@@ meters kilometers .
so i &apos;ve been trying to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ist , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square miles .
that &apos;s more than 25@@ ,000 ac@@ r@@ es .
poli@@ tically , everyone &apos;s appl@@ au@@ ded .
vie@@ wers were very serious and attention to the audience faces .
the head of con@@ gress came on the stage , and he said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your talk , but could we look at the ted@@ talk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i put down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
and i &apos;ve come to the core stat@@ ement that a new city off@@ ers people new opportunities .
there would be an opportunity to live in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also inclu@@ des new possibilities for leaders .
the government in hon@@ dur@@ as would be to help help from partner@@ ships that they could benefit from their partner countries , they could benefit from their partner countries who would encoura@@ ge the laws for this char@@ ter and in the imple@@ ment@@ ation that everybody can trust that the char@@ ter is actually being per@@ posed .
and the discovery of president lo@@ bo , was that the san@@ titude of the transformation that i thought was a way of getting foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come and build this city for all of the par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as that suff@@ ered from fear and mi@@ str@@ ust for many years .
we &apos;ve driven into an area .
this is the picture from this place .
it den@@ ched thousands of square kilometers .
and soon after , on the 19@@ th of janu@@ ary , they vot@@ ed with con@@ gress for a change of the const@@ it@@ ution to have a negoti@@ ation that is essential for particular develop@@ mental environments .
in a country that just has seen a strong crisis behind con@@ gress , it was ele@@ cted in the con@@ gress for 1@@ 24 miles to a
all the par@@ ties , all the organi@@ tions of society , suppor@@ ted this .
to become part of that const@@ it@@ u@@ ency , it needs to be appro@@ ved twice by con@@ gress .
on febru@@ ary , in the 17@@ th of febru@@ ary , it was appro@@ ved to be a voice for 1@@ 14 .
in the immedi@@ ate after that ele@@ ction , between the 21@@ st and 12@@ th of febru@@ ary , a d@@ ele@@ gation ended about 30 hur@@ cers of the world that were interested in the two places of the world that were interested in most of the business of the city .
one place there is south korea .
this is a picture of a big new city town , which is building in south korea -- big than the city party of bo@@ ast .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years , after it took four years to recei@@ ve the per@@ mit@@ s .
the other place that was very interested in urban business is sing@@ apo@@ re .
it &apos;s been building two cities in china , and the third is in prepar@@ ation .
so , if you think of practical thinking , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a site of space , and you &apos;re already going to mention this place for the second city .
it &apos;s already worked in a legal system that leaders allow up to adop@@ tion , and it &apos;s also working in an ex@@ ternal legal system .
a country already announ@@ ced his su@@ pre@@ me court department to provide , as a court for the dist@@ ur@@ bing thir@@ ds of the legal system .
urban designers and corpo@@ ra@@ cians are very interested .
they even bring fund@@ ing to businesses .
one thing , as you know now , has been diagno@@ sed , there are a lot of od@@ ts .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to de@@ constru@@ ct in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who &apos;d like to live there .
over the world there are 700 million people who ad@@ mit that they want to live in a different place .
a million people have lost la@@ tin america every year and migr@@ ated to the united states .
many of them are fa@@ thers who are forced to leave their families to throw work to work -- sometimes , it &apos;s single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clo@@ th@@ es .
unfortunately , sometimes , sometimes there are children who try to find their parents that they , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about hon@@ dur@@ as in hon@@ dur@@ as to build a whole new city ?
or building even dist@@ ant of these cities , or distribu@@ ted hundreds of electr@@ ons all over the world ?
so what is it for an idea to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition around new resi@@ dents ?
so this is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
so my friends in hon@@ dur@@ as asked me to tell me , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you &apos;re doing on a typical day ?
you know , how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , which according to a typical american in a day &apos;s , 70 years ago ,
addi@@ tion@@ ically , recently , a study was made with ce@@ os , where they looked for a ce@@ os for a week .
and these scientists , they just docum@@ ented the different subje@@ cts that these ce@@ o are consum@@ ing , and how much time they have gotten to make decisions that rel@@ ate to the top@@ ics .
and what they found is that an average ce@@ o is bus@@ y with 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks in the week .
each of these the@@ mes , of course , made for lots and lots of little decisions .
fif@@ ty percent of their decisions were met in nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their choices requi@@ red you an hour or more of your time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of categ@@ ory to those in an hour of categ@@ ory ?
how well do you think they &apos;re going to deal with decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the largest decisi@@ on-@@ making of our modern times , the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem .
i want to talk about the problem , and a few possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you a couple of questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i put you a question , you raise , because i &apos;m blind , just one hand , if you want to burn some cal@@ ories .
otherwise , please ask you , when i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question is : are you ready to hear something about the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem ?
thank you very much .
when i was a graduate student at stanford , i went to this very ex@@ ecu@@ tive food center , but at least he was ex@@ clu@@ sive .
it was a store called the dra@@ i@@ ser &apos;s name .
this business , it was almost like a bl@@ ess@@ ing park .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d and obs@@ essi@@ g , over 500 different kinds of fru@@ it and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually dr@@ one up fix@@ ing water .
i loved being to go to this store , but at one point i asked myself , well , how does it come from buying anything ?
here &apos;s the o@@ live oil cour@@ ker .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were caught in sha@@ st@@ oms that came from a thousand years old o@@ vi@@ b@@ ands .
so one day i decided to go to the army one day , and i asked the la@@ d@@ der , &quot; does this model work that they really provide to the people all of these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed on the bus@@ es of tou@@ ri@@ sts who came every day and typically had their c@@ ameras in it .
so we decided to take an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ alle@@ d@@ ship for our experiment .
here &apos;s her mar@@ ch profi@@ le .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of mar@@ sa@@ d@@ ure .
we set a small for@@ co@@ ve sta@@ kes right at the stage of the business .
we put six different fla@@ vor@@ s of ta@@ beg@@ s there , or 24 different taste chan@@ n@@ els , and we looked at two things : one , i think , would i stop more people and do go@@ d@@ der try ?
these are more people sta@@ yed when it was 24 , about 60 percent when they were six , about 40 percent .
and after@@ wards , we saw ourselves that people would rather bought a glass of mar@@ ting a glass of mar@@ ting .
now we looked at the inter@@ si@@ ed effect .
of the people who were left than it were 24 , only three percent were actually bought a glass of mar@@ thou@@ se .
of the people who were left than six , well , we saw that 30 percent of them bought a glass of mar@@ ting a glass of mar@@ ting .
well , if you calcul@@ ated it , people bought six times more a glass of mar@@ sa@@ l , which you had six choices than if you had 24 deci@@ ction .
now , to buy a glass tag is probably good for us -- anyway , it &apos;s good for our ta@@ ist -- but it turns out the decisi@@ on-@@ making problems affect us also influ@@ enced us in very concent@@ r@@ ation decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even if it &apos;s going against our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day : financial sav@@ ings .
so i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , e@@ ich kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang , where we could collect the decisions for almost a million americans from about 6@@ 50 coun@@ ties in the entire united states .
and what we saw was whether the number of f@@ ans who were allowed to be a reti@@ re@@ ment plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , influ@@ enced the prob@@ ability of whether more for tomorrow is saving for tomorrow .
and we found that , in fact , there was a relationship .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 tri@@ es that off@@ ered people somewhere between two to 5@@ 9 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were off@@ ered that , indeed , participa@@ tion was less .
now , if you look at the extreme extreme , the plans that two fund off@@ ers , a partic@@ le in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- still not as big as we want .
in the plans that would acc@@ ele@@ te nearly 60 fund , the sig@@ ning tar@@ gets fell about about the six@@ th-@@ century percentage .
now it turns out that even if you were to agree with interven@@ tion , if more choices were to choose , even it has negative consequences .
so people as@@ s@@ essed to participa@@ te , rather so that the more opportunities were available to them , the more avo@@ i@@ ding them they were avo@@ ying it gra@@ ces and fun@@ ds .
the more opportunities they were given , the more they put all their money in p@@ ure money services .
none of these extreme decisions is ow@@ ned to the decisions that someone would re@@ com@@ men@@ d if we &apos;re important to the future of financial well-@@ being .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that produce this to provide more and more choices from more and more
they pre@@ p@@ are the decision -- push them on , even if it &apos;s going against their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical choices .
they &apos;re more willing to decide for things that you might expect less satis@@ fied , even if you make it obje@@ ctive better .
so the main reason for this is that we might be willing to look at this huge shel@@ ves full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mu@@ star@@ d , achie@@ vement and mar@@ ade , but we can &apos;t draw the compar@@ ing and di@@ stra@@ ction , and then actually sele@@ ct something out of the amazing charge .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we test in various types of research and in different research places -- that they can just use in your business .
first , nar@@ row .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today that less is .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; limit@@ s . &quot;
they always worry they lose the surface of the earth .
but , in fact , we see it more and more that if you &apos;re ready to stop limit@@ s , and the un@@ important consi@@ c@@ tives get rid , well , there &apos;s a rise of sal@@ es , it &apos;s being sequ@@ el@@ ed , you know , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an impro@@ vement of decisi@@ on-@@ making .
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble de@@ cre@@ ased the different head and two species of magni@@ tude to 15 , they thought they worked an increase of sal@@ es by 10 percent .
when the gold c@@ at corpo@@ ration got rid of her 10 to the worst selling c@@ at fin@@ us , they found that the pay@@ s at 8@@ 7 percent -- a result of two , the rise of sal@@ es and re@@ duced costs .
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ kr@@ t today , off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
a typical wal@@ m@@ art off@@ ers you 10@@ 0,000 products today .
but the most 9@@ market super@@ market , which is now north largest super@@ market in the world , is al@@ di , and they offer them 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in a do@@ se .
now in the world of motiv@@ ators , i think one of the best examples that came out recently , about how you best write the choice of choice , was something that david la@@ gar@@ son has very strong contribu@@ ted , it &apos;s a program that is off@@ ered at harvard .
every single harvard fund is auto@@ matically dri@@ f@@ ting at a standard fund .
those who may really want to make a choice are 20 fund off@@ ers , not 300 or more f@@ ond .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m going to dist@@ ingu@@ ish
they &apos;re all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i asked the asking is , &quot; tell me how the ways the possibilities diff@@ er from each other .
and if they can &apos;t keep them apart , their custom@@ ers don &apos;t have their cli@@ ents . &quot;
now , before we started this morning , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
and g@@ ary said that he was ready to offer all the people in this audience who would offer a real paying vac@@ ation to the most beautiful streets in the world .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read you to read .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read , and then i &apos;m going to ask you to cla@@ p along , if you &apos;re willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s service .
okay . each of everybody who &apos;s willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
is that all anyone ?
all right , let me just show you a little bit more of this .
they knew it was a trick , didn &apos;t they ?
now , who &apos;s ready to do this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that you look at obje@@ c@@ tively , the first time more information , than the second time , but i would like to guess that you thought it was a second time .
because the images were helping it re@@ pa@@ y for them .
what brings me to the second technology that help you to deal with the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making , it &apos;s con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between opportunities , to understand what consequences is associated with the individual possibilities , and that that has to be felt of that con@@ sequence that those consequences have to be vi@@ vid and con@@ cre@@ te .
why are people on average about 15 to 30 percent more when they use a commercial card or a credit card than they do in a bar@@ gain ?
because it &apos;s not us we feel good money .
and it turns out that when you make it that something feels con@@ cre@@ te , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you get people to save more .
so in a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o fli@@ ter@@ o , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in the door -- employees who &apos;ve all worked for struggle -- and these people all were in a gather@@ ing in which they sig@@ ned their participa@@ tion for their reti@@ re@@ ment services .
and in this conven@@ tion , we &apos;ve with@@ ered this gather@@ ing as it was always , only we &apos;ve ad@@ ded a small quality .
the small thing that we decided to make was that we asked people to think of just on every positive thing that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
which we did this simple thing , there was an increase of participa@@ tion by 20 percent , and there was an increase from the number of people who were willing to save or raise an increase by four percent by the re@@ venue that they were ready to pay for the sav@@ ings of care .
the third technology : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
we can make better with more categ@@ ories than we deal with more choices .
here &apos;s , for example , a study that we did in a magazine course .
it turns out it &apos;s in the away of super@@ markets on top and down in the nor@@ the@@ ast area , and the number of 3@@ 3@@ 1 different types of maga@@ zin@@ es has vari@@ ed up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 new@@ stry .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es , and i put them in 10 categ@@ ories , or i show you 400 chap@@ ters , and i spread them in a million categ@@ ories , then you think i had more choice and a better opportunity than i had to give you the 400 comm@@ and@@ ments to this , if i had given you the 600 .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how i can hold them apart .
so here are two different g@@ ap@@ s .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz , &quot; and the other is called s@@ wing . &quot;
if you think that the left represents is the left angle , and the ad on the moment is ja@@ zz , then they cla@@ p into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few ones .
if you think that the one on the left is ja@@ zz , and the one on the right is on the right side , you &apos;re cla@@ pping .
all right , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz , and the right on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
this is a highly un@@ reas@@ able categ@@ ori@@ zation .
the categ@@ ories need to say something not that provi@@ des choice , not to provide choice .
and this problem you see often when you look at the long li@@ sts of all these f@@ on@@ ds .
who do you want to in@@ form with it ?
my fourth technology : pre@@ ven@@ tion of complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think we can deal with it .
we need to exp@@ and complexity .
so i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the pur@@ ch@@ ase of a car .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er who provi@@ des you the possibility to con@@ figure her car completely .
you have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to create your car completely .
now these decisions in the number of choices that you offer per decision are currently off@@ ered per choice .
car colors , whit@@ ter color of the car -- i have 5@@ 6 op@@ tions .
mot@@ ors , ge@@ ar -- four op@@ tions .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i &apos;m making the sequence in which the decisions seem .
half the cli@@ ents are going to be from the many possibilities , 5@@ 6 car colors at the low opportunities , four cu@@ l@@ ings .
the other half of the custom@@ er is going from the low possibilities , four ge@@ ar , to the 5@@ 6 car colors , many possibilities .
what do you look at me ?
how good they are .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choice in the decision , that means that they &apos;re over@@ per@@ formed , that &apos;s the cool@@ est , i &apos;ll lose them .
what they find is that the people who are going from many to the low choices will keep vot@@ ing and again and again the standard choice .
we are losing them .
go from the little choice to the many choices in many , stay there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the sequence that this information is pres@@ enting .
when i start with the simple exam@@ ination , i &apos;m learning how i choose .
even though the ge@@ ese sele@@ cts , i don &apos;t say anything about my supp@@ lege with the inter@@ ior mind , i &apos;m still prepar@@ ing it .
it also puts me on exciting terms about the big product that i collapse , and so i &apos;m ready to motiv@@ ate myself with interest .
so let me sum@@ mar@@ ize .
i &apos;ve talked to you about four techniques that the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making mil@@ ges -- con@@ fir@@ ms -- are they going to lose the reli@@ able alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zing -- do it real ; categ@@ ori@@ zing , we can better pre@@ p@@ are with more categ@@ ories , less possibilities ; to pre@@ p@@ are complexity
every one of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today is to help them to manage the opportunities -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for the people they offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re sel@@ ec@@ tive in the sele@@ ction .
and the more we choose when we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in mer@@ c@@ ca , laun@@ ching man@@ ager at youtube . i used to look at youtube video .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how microsoft is vi@@ ral , and then again , why is it important for even .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed so inten@@ se as infin@@ itely difficult .
but web video has allo@@ w@@ ned that we can all be artic@@ ul@@ ated , or all our creative activi@@ ties in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous on the internet to the next satur@@ day .
but at youtube , over 4@@ 8 hours of video per minute is u@@ plo@@ aded .
again , only a tiny percentage is ever vi@@ ral a tiny percentage , and it &apos;s looked at thousands of times and so on the cultural moment .
so , how does it work ?
three things : ta@@ st@@ ers , partic@@ le groups , and the un@@ expected .
well , let &apos;s take a look .
oh , my god . oh my god .
oh , my god !
who@@ a !
u@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
last year , white vas@@ ber z took this video that he was fil@@ med in front of his house in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
this ch@@ art shows what it looks like when the video was popular last summer .
in fact , henry didn &apos;t want to make a vi@@ ral video .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ hu@@ bo@@ w .
because you can &apos;t do that , if you call the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain galaxy .
he had u@@ plo@@ aded a lot of natural video .
and this video was actually being sent in janu@@ ary .
so what happened here ?
and j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel came up .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel then took the t@@ we@@ et , who was so popular at the inst@@ ant .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ glo@@ glo@@ a introdu@@ ces us new and interesting things , and they show them a big audience .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . god . god get down@@ day to the wee@@ k@@ end . everybody &apos;s foot@@ i@@ to to the wee@@ k@@ end , scot@@ k@@ le . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . you weren &apos;t thinking that we were going to lead those care@@ ers without talking about this video , i hope .
re@@ bec@@ ca ji@@ ac@@ k &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graphi@@ cs looked like .
just like &quot; axis rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; seems like it &apos;s not done out of it .
what &apos;s happened that day ?
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s right .
so if you want to know , these other spi@@ kes are also fri@@ days .
but what about that day , this particular fri@@ day , this particular fri@@ day ?
well to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 , it took it , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from the myster@@ y science theater was a first person to make a funny on twitter about this .
now what matters is that a single person or group of ta@@ ste@@ tors took a focus , and they shared a big audience , and it acceler@@ ated the process .
then this community , of people who were involved in this big tag@@ ging , and started talking about it and started to play around with it .
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ ck day &quot; at youtube .
there was a par@@ o@@ dy in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single week .
unlike the en@@ equal entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , the participa@@ tion of the community is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by stre@@ ading it or doing something new .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at , &quot; is anima@@ tion and music in end@@ -@@ down loo@@ p .
it &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
this year , almost 50 million times it was vie@@ wed .
and if you keep that for ridi@@ cul@@ ous , you should know that there &apos;s a three hours of data that was looked at four million times .
and even cat@@ s look at this video .
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s , who look at this video .
what &apos;s important is the creativity that is in the internet culture of tech and ge@@ e@@ ks .
there was re@@ mix@@ e .
somebody made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of this .
and then it became international .
a whole re@@ mix community was sho@@ ot@@ ed from the floor to something that made it from a stupid jo@@ ke to something we can all agree .
we don &apos;t just find bl@@ ess@@ ing about something , we do with it .
who could have thought that would all have come to
who could predict &quot; please rain@@ bo@@ w , &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or n@@ y@@ an c@@ at ?
what were the names that used to write her where this is supposed to be ?
in a world where each minute is u@@ plo@@ aded two days of video , only very unique and un@@ expected images like that mentioned videos like this .
now , i ad@@ mit , i wasn &apos;t quite interested in , when a friend told me , i look at this great video , about a guy who fi@@ sts in new york against a c@@ up of ti@@ me@@ on .
i got a ti@@ cket , because i didn &apos;t go on the bi@@ ke , but often there are dis@@ ab@@ led there , that there are often dis@@ abilities that are not constantly driving on the bi@@ ke path .
because this was quite surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey swe@@ wer@@ s became funny idea , and his reason was looking at five million times .
this approach is true for all new things that we do .
and that all takes us to one of the big questions ...
and what does that mean ?
ah@@ h@@ h@@ h .
and what does that mean ?
ta@@ sting manufac@@ stic communities , creative explor@@ er communities , are un@@ expected , are the characteri@@ stics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to , and where the audi@@ ences defined the audience .
as i said , one of the major stars now -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- did his start at youtube .
no one has to give up green light .
and today , we are all feeling as ow@@ ners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteri@@ stics of the old media , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely to the media of today , but they &apos;re going to deter@@ mine the conversation of the future .
thank you very much .
how can i talk for 10 minutes about conne@@ cting women over three generations , and how the ast@@ on@@ ishing strength of this lin@@ e@@ dness was mani@@ fest in the lives of a four@@ -year-old girl in the lives of a four@@ -year-old girl , when she was combin@@ ed over 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , in a small boat in the chinese sea , a connection that was stuck in his life in the life of this little girl and never disappe@@ ared -- this little girl that now lived in san francisco and spea@@ ks to you today ?
there &apos;s not a story the story .
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that is still put together .
so i want to tell you about some of the puzz@@ le .
imagine the first piece : a man who was burning his life &apos;s work .
he &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a man whose whole life has been put together by the simple hope of his own hom@@ eland and freedom .
now if you look at him in as@@ ig@@ on of the communic@@ ations in sa@@ ig@@ on , he must ad@@ mit that his life was a very a wa@@ sting .
the words , as long as his friends , wi@@ shed his fing@@ ered .
he moved back into sil@@ ence .
he died , broke by the story .
and he &apos;s my grand@@ father .
i never stru@@ ck him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our own memor@@ ies .
my grandmother never for@@ got me to forget his life .
i had to make sure it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to cr@@ ush us , but we ran it through .
the next piece is how a boat is running up in the early mor@@ di@@ an red sil@@ ver on la@@ ke .
my mother , may , was 18 when her father died -- in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , with two little girls .
for her , life had asked her to do a job : the flight of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely dist@@ ant that they could fail to fail .
after a four@@ -year-old and film sa@@ va cor@@ respon@@ ded a boat on the sea , as fishing see@@ ds rop@@ ed .
all adults became aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had in front of pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wor@@ e a little tox@@ ic bottle .
with a pris@@ on@@ er , my sister and me would have just had my sister and me dr@@ ash about it .
my first memor@@ ies are from this boat -- the ste@@ ad@@ y tu@@ b@@ bers of the mot@@ ors , the cla@@ pping of one wave on the bu@@ g , the vast and empty hori@@ zon .
i don &apos;t remember the pi@@ st@@ ings that came a lot of times , but they were sho@@ wing away from the death of men on our boat , or the bottom of the police that didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in the mal@@ ay@@ an coast , and to the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first apple , which one of the men gave me on the platform .
no apple ever pus@@ hed that out again .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece is from four women in three generations , which together build a new life .
we left in foot@@ sc@@ ray , one from work@@ work court in the sub@@ ur@@ bs that surro@@ unded popu@@ lations from im@@ migr@@ ant repor@@ ts .
unlike other in the ol@@ d-@@ year classroom department , which existence was completely un@@ known , there were no sophisti@@ cated thinking in ph sc@@ ray .
the cab@@ ks coming out of the flo@@ ors from the rest of the world .
and the teen@@ y english stories were broad@@ cast between people who had one thing in common : they started re@@ an .
my mom worked on far@@ ms , then on a re@@ wing band in a car factory , six days , dou@@ ble@@ -@@ double la@@ yers .
it gave me somehow to find the time to access english and it@@ ary quali@@ fi@@ cations .
we &apos;ve been poor .
every one dollar was cut , and was con@@ sol@@ ed into higher education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it , mostly were the new stuff , which always came from the second hand .
two pair of str@@ ings for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
a school uni@@ form to the key bo@@ xes because she had to stick six years .
and there were the rare but pain@@ ful gi@@ irs of &quot; bad eye , &quot; and here and here , and here , &quot; asi@@ ts , goes home . &quot;
after now , where ?
a little bit memor@@ ed in me .
there was a meeting to re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation , and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i du@@ st@@ le in the same bed .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we told each other of our day , and i heard to listen to the mov@@ ements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suff@@ ered about the les@@ i@@ ons from the boat .
and it was my job to stay a@@ wake every night until her ni@@ ght@@ ful dreams came , so i could slow it up .
she opened a computer business , then did a co@@ s@@ me@@ tic training , and then made a business .
and the women came through their stories of men who didn &apos;t feed change , an@@ gry and im@@ flexi@@ ble , and pe@@ cu@@ l@@ ated children , united worl@@ ds caught between two worl@@ ds .
lo@@ ans and spon@@ sor@@ s have been se@@ arch@@ ed .
central centers were built .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ a@@ tic student who helped incredibly comp@@ am@@ able conver@@ sa@@ tions in himself .
so , in the other hand , i was involved in un@@ safe life , wearing the tra@@ gic sc@@ ars of violence , drug ab@@ use and insu@@ lation .
but that was how many people left for the years .
and because of these sorts of help , i was sel@@ ec@@ ted in my last year of law austr@@ ali@@ ans of the year .
and i was ul@@ tter@@ ed by a piece of puzz@@ le to the next , and the ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anony@@ m her@@ ners of foot@@ sc@@ ray , now tan , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activi@@ sts , who became invited to talk to places that they never heard and in res@@ identi@@ al care , they could never have heard of it , and in res@@ identi@@ ations , they can never have imag@@ ined .
i didn &apos;t know the news lab@@ els .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the cro@@ ss@@ fly .
i didn &apos;t know about how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know about anything to talk about anything .
i wanted to go to the r@@ out@@ ine and the em@@ ble@@ dness of an un@@ known pres@@ cri@@ ption -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters who dist@@ ingu@@ ked every single day as 20 years , by telling each other the stories of their day told and st@@ ops , we still got three in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she remin@@ ded me that i now was as old as she was at the time when we clim@@ bed the boat .
no , never had been a way .
&quot; do it just , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t know what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about ju@@ gen@@ dar@@ y and education , and mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and brand@@ ed of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the life@@ ways , so many of them were doing what they loved on the bor@@ ders of the possible .
and even though i gradu@@ ated from my , i realized that i could not find myself with a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
there had to be another piece of puzz@@ o .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new bon@@ te@@ ur , new in the image -- and not just okay , but not just okay , but something you have to gr@@ ist , maybe a gift of the bo@@ ots .
because to speak so ligh@@ tly to collapse , it can mean ligh@@ tly to collapse of the environment , so light can make the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the
so i &apos;m now left enough from my conven@@ tional zone to know that , yes , break the world out , but not the way you &apos;re concerned .
possibilities that would not be allowed were ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly integr@@ ated .
there was a energy , an in@@ san@@ able optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and the wa@@ g@@ ging .
so i looked at my gut feeling .
i colle@@ cted a little team of people around me for whom the sha@@ ke didn &apos;t occu@@ r , &quot; a stra@@ ig@@ h@@ u@@ ous challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a co@@ p .
at the end of a day , i co@@ ined a huge ma@@ d@@ th sou@@ p that we shared .
we worked late the night late .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a couple of brilliant , and we were able to do the break@@ through .
i met the decision to move to the u.@@ s .
after just a journey there .
my gut sen@@ ch again .
three months later , i was moved , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure continu@@ es .
now , before i leave that talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in in the most important person .
life has not changed for cent@@ u@@ ries for cent@@ u@@ ries .
her father died shor@@ tly after her birth .
her mother just re@@ moved her .
at 17 , she was the second woman of a mand@@ ar@@ in , whose mother suggest@@ ed her .
without assi@@ stance of her husband , she suff@@ ered her for a fe@@ d@@ ding by brought him in court and was in her own case , and a much bigger sen@@ sation when she won .
&quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; it was un@@ anim@@ ous .
i just du@@ sted in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney when she died , a thousand miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and i looked through the nar@@ row wall , and i looked at it on the other side .
i knew she came to be wrong to leave .
my mother was calling me for a few minutes after@@ wards .
a few days later , we went into a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in 3d sc@@ ray , and we sat around their sar@@ g .
we told her stories , and as@@ sur@@ ed her that we were with her .
about mid@@ night , the mon@@ k , and said he had to close the sar@@ let .
my mother asked us to shu@@ t her hand .
and she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm , and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she kept it ton@@ ight , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave her out . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , then it &apos;s moving through the women .
and you see who we were , and how life sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who might have had had to be in our lives , would have us come to the corner .
the de@@ fe@@ ct would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think of the boat .
who would ever ever want to have a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m sc@@ ared of privi@@ lege , in hei@@ ght , for p@@ ure pro@@ cla@@ her@@ ation .
can i give you a bo@@ g in your life , the coura@@ ge@@ ous of every wave de@@ fle@@ cted , the un@@ adul@@ ted tu@@ cks of the mot@@ ors , the wide hori@@ zon that doesn &apos;t guar@@ an@@ tee ?
well i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that , and i &apos;m sure you could take through it , i would .
and also , t@@ ans &apos;s mother is in the fourth or fif@@ th row today .
and i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y with you .
is it ever photograph@@ y ?
because of course that &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
but my interest in photograph@@ y started when i was having my first digital camera , at age 15 years old .
i combin@@ ed it with my earlier pre@@ occu@@ pa@@ tion for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera using a lot more in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , you end the process when you press on the recei@@ ver .
so for me , photograph@@ y seemed to be more about to be in the right place at the right place .
i believed anyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process starts when the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es is being pres@@ sed .
photos like this : a space on a much wi@@ der road .
but it has an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
and yet still still is a reali@@ stic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and color@@ ful simul@@ tane@@ ously , but all with the common goal to keep a reali@@ stic level .
when i say reality , i mean to think of son@@ o reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i &apos;d never like it to look as if you could have had it , on a picture .
photographs that you have to think a little bit about to find the trick .
so it &apos;s very much about cat@@ ching an idea as really a moment .
what &apos;s the trick that makes it reali@@ stic look at ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what does the illusion creates ?
sometimes it &apos;s the perspective of the illusion .
but in the end , it &apos;s about how we interpre@@ t the world , and how we can be made on a two-@@ dimensional structure .
it &apos;s not what reali@@ stic is reali@@ stic , but what we think about reali@@ stic .
so , i think , the basic laws are very simple .
i see them as a puzz@@ le of reality , where you can take several pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example of this .
we have three ultra@@ -@@ symme@@ able objects that we can all identify with in a three-@@ dimensional world .
but combin@@ ed in a particular way , you can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , as if it could exist .
but then , at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t really accept that it doesn &apos;t really matter .
and i &apos;m looking at the same process combin@@ ing pictures .
it &apos;s really just about mix@@ ing different reali@@ ties .
so the things that make an image reali@@ stic come out reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our daily life .
so if we com@@ bine images , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you look mis@@ er@@ able .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to reach out to achieve a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
as you can see , these are not three special pain@@ t@@ ings .
but com@@ bine something special like this to create something special like this .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ing photos should have the same thing .
secon@@ dly , we need to have the same ligh@@ ting way of ligh@@ ting .
and these two pictures meet these two eff@@ or@@ ts -- from the same al@@ titude , and the same ligh@@ ting way .
and third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to make it possible where the individual images start and end by conne@@ cting them se@@ am@@ less@@ less@@ ly .
it makes impossible to say how the picture was actually put together .
so by looking at paint , contr@@ ast and blin@@ dness on the sta@@ tions to high@@ mar@@ ish the individual pictures , cut photogra@@ phic barri@@ ers , like the field dep@@ th , dis@@ rup@@ ted colors and dis@@ ruption , we sleep the boundar@@ ies between the different images , and let it look like a single photo , though a picture can basically em@@ ph@@ ere hundreds of levels .
now , here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is just a landscape image , and the lower part was mani@@ pul@@ ated .
but this image is actually completely com@@ posed of pictures from photographs of different places .
i personally fin@@ der that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go a com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
but it invol@@ ves a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them , to find the different places for the pieces of the j@@ ig@@ les .
for example , the fish had been absor@@ bed on an an@@ ro@@ wing ride .
the winter is from a different place .
the under@@ water part is made out of a quar@@ ch .
and yeah , i actually f@@ ed the house up on the island to make it look swe@@ dis@@ h .
so to get a reali@@ stic out@@ come , it &apos;s been ha@@ ining from me on planning .
i always start with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
that &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of the various images .
and here , every piece of it mentioned very well .
and when you make good brea@@ ks , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite reali@@ stic .
so they are there all the tools , and the only thing that li@@ mi@@ ts us is our imagination .
thank you very much .
i would like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects fail .
and i think the most important thing about this is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced at the auth@@ or of the hi@@ b@@ lands university was to make a major audience .
it doesn &apos;t really work very scienti@@ fically -- it shows a c@@ up of coffee or a te@@ a , and ask the patient , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how do you do ?
how can we help with you ? &quot;
and we think , we want to think that this is one of the main problems why everybody -- maybe most of the electr@@ onic health projects failed : because we &apos;ve stopped listening .
this is my wir@@ eless flat age . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a butt@@ on , she &apos;s got a butt@@ on .
and i &apos;m going to jump for it every morning .
and yeah , i have a job , as you might notice .
i sat my job at 95 k@@ g .
it &apos;s easy to do that : every time i jum@@ ped up the ward , she &apos;ll send my data on google health .
and there , they &apos;re also called my general dan@@ ger , so he can recognize where my power is , not just the moment where i need to help car@@ di@@ ological support or something , but also to a look at the past .
now , there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4@@ ,000 fol@@ ders on twitter .
so every morning i jum@@ p up on my ta@@ hn ini@@ tial , and people talk to me before i go in the car , &quot; to lunch just before i sit in the car , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
but this is the ni@@ gh@@ test thing about what can happen , because this is the rou@@ ta@@ ge , grou@@ er to help patients , because that could be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , or it could be used to smo@@ ke users .
but it could also be used to get people from their cha@@ irs , and to get them to play any kind of play to control their health .
at the next week , it &apos;s coming at the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little blood pressure dete@@ ction that you &apos;re holding to an iphone or something .
and it &apos;s going to en@@ able people to measure their blood pressure , send it on their doctor and share it for example with others for a little over 100 dollars .
at that point , the patients come in . they cannot take control of control , glob@@ um on their own ship , but also in health care , in the face of the challenges that are before us , and the cost of health care , and dou@@ ble@@ -@@ re@@ public , and so on .
do things that are easy to use , and start to hu@@ g patients with this , to start heal@@ ing in the team .
and they can do that by these metho@@ ds , but also crow@@ d@@ source by crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i &apos;d like to share with you a little video video .
we have all sorts of navi@@ gation systems in our cars .
in fact , even in our cell phones .
we know pre@@ cis@@ ely where all of the at@@ ms are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ zing .
we know another one where all of these gas sta@@ tions are .
and yeah , we can find fast food cha@@ ins .
but where would the next a@@ ss would help to help this patient ?
we were asking around , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the ne@@ ar@@ est life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was in that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we edi@@ ted a website and asked a crowd of people , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please share with where he is , when he has up , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business time , of course .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds have been repor@@ ted in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
so the next step was to find the app@@ s for this .
and we &apos;ve designed an i@@ pad ap@@ p .
we developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , exp@@ and@@ ed reality to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht , and someone wra@@ ps up , you can use your iphone , and in the next couple of weeks , your micro@@ software cell phone to find the next a@@ ar that can save lives .
and by today , we don &apos;t just want it as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , as the product is called a@@ g@@ 4@@ us , it &apos;s also taking place as a@@ g@@ 4@@ us .
and we want to bring this up on a worldwide level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universi@@ ties , about helping us how to be@@ have like clu@@ es to crow@@ d@@ source these a@@ e@@ ds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and someone &apos;s collap@@ sing , whether it &apos;s your own relative or anyone else , you can find such an a@@ ed like this .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies around the world help us with con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion of these a@@ e@@ ds .
these might be a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ kee@@ pers , or techni@@ cians , for example , to make sure that the sig@@ ned a@@ ed is still in this place .
please join us in this , and try to take health not just a little bit better , but take control of it
thank you very much .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p , that we want us to force us to conser@@ vation by ...
... it &apos;s paying the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
so here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s invited .
now , we can just jump across that -- i &apos;ll just jump over the video instead .
no@@ pe .
this is not ...
all right .
sol@@ sol@@ y-@@ technology technology .
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in a neighborhood that is pretty much everything they actually hate , we let them work in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace cor@@ ps for computer ge@@ e@@ ks .
we choose some of the fel@@ lo@@ ws every year , and we let them work with dom@@ esti@@ c ste@@ war@@ ds .
instead of sending it to the third world , we send it in the@@ th@@ e@@ d@@ ons .
and they developed great app@@ s , worked with dom@@ esti@@ c employees .
but what you really do is is to show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so get on al .
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s se@@ arch@@ ing for a date , but what he &apos;s looking at is somebody who dri@@ ves him down him when he &apos;s in the process , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at brand@@ ing when he &apos;s sus@@ pen@@ ded by a meter of s@@ now .
how did he get to look for assi@@ stance in this particular way ?
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year , called the &quot; code for america . &quot;
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it did tend to have a lot of time last febru@@ ary .
and they found that the city never sna@@ ps these hy@@ dr@@ ents fre@@ ak@@ ed out .
but a particular fellow , a man named er@@ ik &apos;s fe@@ ver , saw another thing , and that was that the resi@@ dents were breaking the si@@ de@@ walk , right in front of these divi@@ del@@ ines .
so he did what every good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p , where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
you know that you &apos;re going to throw to stop it when it &apos;s mel@@ ting .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and then he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take somebody away .
so , there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a very hum@@ ble little ap@@ p .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that the ro@@ ses wrote in the last year .
but it does something that no other government technology is doing .
it spre@@ ads down dec@@ ents .
there &apos;s this guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . con@@ fron@@ tion of the city hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who has seen that he could use this ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but to adop@@ t the citizens of tsun@@ am@@ i si@@ r@@ ens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ am@@ ics work , but people are ste@@ aling the bat@@ ter@@ ies .
this is how he got the citizens to check them .
and then se@@ attle decided to use the ap@@ p to get the citizens to clean the bri@@ ff@@ et@@ ed gul@@ l@@ ys .
and chicago has just launched it so that people get the rus@@ h out of the hum@@ ck , when it &apos;s acceler@@ ating .
we know that there are nine cities that plan to use this ap@@ p .
and it &apos;s pro@@ gressi@@ vely distribu@@ ted , organic , of course .
if you know about govern@@ ance technology , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually run that way .
the creation of software is taking a couple of years in the process .
we had a team that worked last year on a project in boston for which three people needed two-@@ and-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half months .
it was about a method where parents can find out who are the right public schools for their kids .
we were told later that if it were going to go over the normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken it over two years , and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing at all .
there &apos;s a project right now in california law , which the tax@@ pa@@ yers has used to double two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an ap@@ p , which is written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spre@@ ading from dec@@ line , is a kind of a s@@ y before the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private business , like a lot of people think that it should be .
and not even like a tech enter@@ prise , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free attra@@ ction , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s very important .
but more importantly about this ap@@ p is that it represents a new generation that pac@@ ked the problem of government -- not as the problem of a pl@@ ot@@ ed institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and it &apos;s a very good problem because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at colle@@ ctive technology with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who produce the tools that we need to make things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; man@@ lo@@ ws for america &apos;s beach , there are hundreds of people all over the country who write up and write government app@@ s , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re horri@@ bly fru@@ strated with you , but they don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in about it , but they don &apos;t re@@ pair them .
and these guys know something that we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all feel your feelings about politics and the sna@@ ke in partner@@ ship and enjo@@ ying all the other things that we really are excited about , is government , in the heart , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have to give up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people of those people , i want you to think about it , because the things change .
politics is not changing ; the government is in the transition .
and because the government finally fa@@ ked their power out of us -- let &apos;s remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; how we think about it , how we think about it , will happen like this .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government , when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought , hiv is basically about choo@@ sing people in a san@@ ting .
now after two years , i conclu@@ ded that it was particularly in community , in terms of mar@@ su@@ ph@@ es .
this is the call centers for service and information .
you usually come out there when you call 3@@ 11 in your own city .
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scot@@ t ris@@ del@@ man as part of the program — in fact , do all of you -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call the government for many different problems , including that a th@@ yl@@ ue in your house is .
so scot@@ t gets this as@@ ser@@ f .
he ti@@ cks &quot; sat@@ se@@ gr@@ ates &quot; into the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and he &apos;s not really an idea . he &apos;s cat@@ ching up with the nur@@ sing .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors in your house and play very l@@ oud music and see if the li@@ ve@@ stock was@@ hes away ? &quot;
and that worked . appl@@ ause for scot@@ t .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the mar@@ su@@ s .
van doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it has an ap@@ p , a web and cell ap@@ p , called &quot; citizens pas@@ sing . &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this ap@@ p .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
one day -- this is a actual report -- came in : &quot; el@@ se@@ dor@@ ts in my tr@@ ash . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them out ? &quot;
but what happened with citizens link , &quot; is different .
scot@@ t poin@@ ted from man to person .
but in &quot; citizens link , &quot; everything is publi@@ c@@ ly available , so that everybody can see it .
and in this case , it was seen a neighb@@ or .
and the next post that we got was , &quot; i went over there , came over , the g@@ arb@@ age behind the house .
mar@@ ran@@ ts ? yes . life ? y@@ ap .
turned the waste bul@@ b on the page . went home .
good night , swe@@ et mar@@ tel@@ u@@ tes . &quot;
it &apos;s pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is where the digital is physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of a platform .
i &apos;m going to talk more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help other people .
a citi@@ zen helped help another citi@@ zen , but the government was played a central role here .
they put these two people together .
and they could have taken them with government services if that was needed , but a neighb@@ or is much better and che@@ aper alternative to state services .
if a neighb@@ or helps each other , we create our communities .
we call the person who , a lot of money , we cost it a lot
one of the most important things is that we have to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the other input of the other .
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is vot@@ ing .
how often we have elec@@ ted a political leaders -- and sometimes we &apos;ve consum@@ ed a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we d@@ end back , and we expect the government , our values and our needs , and then it doesn &apos;t change much ?
that is because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top 15@@ -@@ centi@@ meter .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bu@@ cri@@ au@@ p@@ cri@@ p@@ cy .
and we use this word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
but it &apos;s this dis@@ da@@ in that this thing that we own and that we pay for is something that we pay for something that works against us , something else , and then we work ourselves .
people seem to think it &apos;s called politics is sex@@ y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make a bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
because that is where the actual govern@@ ance is happening .
we need to put ourselves on the machin@@ s of government .
so the occu@@ pi@@ ic@@ e@@ al movement has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of wor@@ thy citizens who wrote a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report , which is an answer to the star mem@@ o about the dete@@ ctive re@@ form of the legal re@@ form
this is not poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active .
now , for those of us who have been given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about it , about the world that we want to leave to our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to face .
do we really believe that we &apos;re achie@@ ving what we need to do without the institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely important , but they need to become more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to re@@ define the function of the government , in a way that can actually achieve something by en@@ rich@@ ed society .
and there &apos;s one generation that &apos;s grown up to the internet , and who knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build exactly systems .
now , the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation of older than most of you .
this is a generation that has grown up to see their voice as gran@@ ted .
they don &apos;t fight this battle that we all fight , for who can talk to who speak ; they all talk to speech .
you can express your mind in every chan@@ nel at any time , and you do .
so , if you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that encoura@@ ge the job of government .
and these app@@ s allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be to get a hy@@ dr@@ ant rele@@ ase , cr@@ ats to tor@@ e a tr@@ ash , turn a tr@@ ash tube with a th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine .
and sure , we would have to burn these hy@@ dr@@ ants all the time , and a lot of people do that .
but these app@@ s are like small digital memor@@ ies that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we are not just consu@@ mer@@ men , and we &apos;re not just consu@@ sing the government that are paying control and adverti@@ sing .
we are more than that , we &apos;re a citi@@ zen .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government unless we improve the civil citi@@ zen@@ ship .
so the question that i &apos;ve all got here for you : when it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re going to be just a lot of voices , or will we be going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role in expla@@ ining people how wonderful the new technologies that are on the rise are going to be . and i thought , because i &apos;m here under friends , i would tell you what i really think i &apos;m thinking , and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s really happening with these incredible le@@ ases forward to front , which is so quickly that we can bar@@ ely cannot afford .
so i &apos;m going to start with you a little bit quickly , a single bor@@ ing slide .
... maybe you could just show the slide .
this is a slide that i happen to cho@@ se from my cre@@ ator , eventually .
i &apos;m not about the details of the slide , it &apos;s about the general shape .
this slide shows data an analysis of an analysis of ris@@ c process@@ ors as compared with the performance of a block of cyber@@ block networks .
and what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , as some of us , that we often hit in our field , is a kind of just on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve .
in other words , every step here is appe@@ aring to a poten@@ cy in the performance .
and that &apos;s a psychology that we need to use this type of scale to se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic clas@@ ves in the field of technology .
something very od@@ d happens here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you want to pull the light back .
a bit more bright , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graph@@ s in technology to se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves ?
the reason for this is , if i would draw it on a normal cur@@ ve , where , say , this is the years , which is the time of a kind , and this is a random measure of a kind , and this is a random measure of technology that i &apos;m trying to show with a gra@@ m , is going to become the graph al@@ ber@@ n .
they look like it &apos;s like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now if i want to print a different technology , let &apos;s say a transpor@@ tation technology , then that would be very un@@ reas@@ on@@ able on the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ging scale , in shape of a flat line .
but if something like this happens here , it changes the artic@@ e@@ al@@ ative conditions .
so if the transpor@@ tation technology would continue as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology technology , we could go in to a tax@@ i , and in 30 seconds we were able to be in to@@ k@@ yo .
but it doesn &apos;t get that fast .
this has never been in the history of technology , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth , by which the scale scale all over the years incre@@ ases every few years .
so the question that i &apos;d like to ask you now is , when you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you can see , they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever has evolved forever and forever as fast as now .
there are two op@@ tions .
either it &apos;s going to get a classi@@ c bes@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something fundament@@ ally emerging emerging , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
well , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think something like this is going to happen like this .
that really means that we are , we &apos;re in the middle at the right at the right right now
we &apos;re on this line , in a transition from the everyday world to a new kind of world .
so the question that i want to ask and also a lot of myself is a lot of myself , is how is this new world will be
what is this new condition that slowly redu@@ ces the world ?
because the transition seems very , very con@@ v@@ asi@@ ve when you &apos;re in the middle .
when i was a kid , there was a future somewhere about 2000 , and people often talked about what might happen in 2000 in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you find that the future is still in the year 2000 .
we go further than we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future is s@@ hr@@ in@@ ked every year since i &apos;m in this world .
i think the reason for that is that we realize that there is something wrong .
the transition is happening . we all feel it .
and we know that there &apos;s just no point right now to try to look in the future for 30 or 50 years , because everything will be so different , that a simple amount of extra@@ ction of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
i want to talk about what this might be , this transition that we &apos;re currently at right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk first about a couple of other things , which really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to go back a step and look at the thing on a longer scale scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the ti@@ me@@ scale of the earth &apos;s life .
i think the big picture makes sense when you divi@@ de it into some billion billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and this is 2.@@ 5 billion years . the earth was a big , ster@@ i@@ le stone pen with many of that flo@@ ating chemicals .
so if you look at how these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they applied that .
i also believe there are theor@@ ies that start understanding like everything with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied story of what is that at that time , little oil dro@@ p@@ let flo@@ cks that inje@@ ct different types of reci@@ pes for chemicals .
some of these oil dro@@ p@@ let forces infe@@ cted a special combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed them to integra@@ te other chemicals from outside and so to grow .
everybody was all that that started to divi@@ de .
these little oil dro@@ p@@ let dro@@ ps were the most primi@@ tive cell form .
but these oil dro@@ ple@@ ts were not about alive in today , because every single one was just a small , acci@@ dent@@ al reci@@ pe of chemicals .
and each time it divi@@ ded , the resul@@ ted chemicals have spread into un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented amo@@ unts .
so every dro@@ p@@ let was a little bit different .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ let grew the dro@@ ps that had one for the growth of op@@ mag@@ id com@@ pounds faster than others and effici@@ ent more and more chemicals and shared quickly .
so these qu@@ re@@ cks to survive longer and they spread in lar@@ gely ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation .
so this is just a very simple chemical form , but more interesting it will be if this dro@@ p@@ let learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
in any ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , this dri@@ p@@ pet has the ability to as@@ sign information pre@@ vent@@ ing information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the reci@@ pe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , they found a way in this spi@@ ritual , evolutionary way that allowed them to fa@@ ke down what they were out of , so that this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ i@@ ed .
and the amazing thing is that this kind of information to store information over the time of 2.@@ 5 billion years where it &apos;s been born , right ?
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us is that our genes , from exactly the same code , and the same magni@@ fi@@ can@@ ce .
and that is that every cre@@ ature uses exactly the same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re so close to writing ourselves in this code , just to write ourselves in this code .
and i have 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of a white impul@@ se , which i &apos;m trying to keep in air@@ por@@ ts on air@@ por@@ ts for security men .
it &apos;s in it -- what i did is , i took this code -- the code is made of regular letter , which we &apos;re using to symbo@@ li@@ ze -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve combin@@ ed it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants to have someone a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even anyone in the world , and it &apos;s right
if i was actually a e@@ ag@@ ist , i would have written it on a virus , and put it in the room .
so , what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna wrote the dna was an interesting step .
and these cells made these cells -- they made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that is , that &apos;s when these cells started to communicate and to exchange information , so that communities of cells emer@@ ged .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve known that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , the en@@ dur@@ ance to antibio@@ tics is growing .
some bacteria have figured out how to keep reach@@ ing from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and they &apos;ve written this information with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because the bacteria communic@@ ate to each other .
this communic@@ ations now allowed the reasons of communities , which were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were a sy@@ ner@@ ge@@ tic .
so they either survi@@ ved together , or they were going under together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of community were re@@ treated and pre@@ fer@@ red by evolution .
the transition line is there , where these communities brought together so close that they determin@@ ed to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community into a drawing chain on the dna .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point , we have multi-@@ dimensional communities , communities of many different cell types of cells that together work as an individual organis@@ m .
indeed , we are also such a multi-@@ cell@@ enti@@ al community .
we have a lot of cells that are not repres@@ ented on itself .
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started evol@@ ving , so that the area where evolution was born , no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community , which we call the organis@@ m .
so the next step is happening in these communities .
the cell communities began to abstra@@ ct information again .
and they developed special structures that did nothing else than process@@ ing information within the organis@@ m .
and these are the neu@@ ral structures .
so the neurons are the information oper@@ ations appar@@ at@@ us that these cell communities have built .
they started forming speci@@ alists within the community , specific structures that were related to learning , understanding and pi@@ cking up information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
so this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this moment , an individual -- learning right now in the time of an individual organis@@ m , rather than this evolutionary range of time .
so an organis@@ m could learn , for example , to eat a particular fru@@ it , because she ta@@ sted bad and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
this could now be within the lifetime of an individual organis@@ m , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be evolution@@ arily learned by the individuals who died from this ferti@@ li@@ ze , because these information process@@ ing structures were not there yet .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process of dealing with these particular information structures , because evolution could now take within an individual .
it could take about a ti@@ mel@@ ine learning in a time learning .
what happened after@@ wards is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
once for example , the most resili@@ ent to what &apos;s known about this communication of communication is human language .
but it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , un@@ com@@ passionate idea here , and conf@@ used in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and giving basically stun@@ ning sounds of me , in which hope to create a simil@@ arly conf@@ used idea in your head that has somehow has a similar simil@@ ar@@ ity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , conver@@ ting it into sound , a sequence of sound , and producing something very complicated with it in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work as a uni@@ vi@@ al organis@@ m .
and what we actually did is , we , humanity , is , we &apos;re abstra@@ ct to abstra@@ ct .
we &apos;re going through the same strat@@ ations that have under@@ made multiple cell organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds , how we stop data .
so the invention of language , for example , was a small step in that direction .
tele@@ ony , computers , video inter@@ faces , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms , and so on , all of our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we &apos;ve built in our community to deal with this information .
and it conne@@ cts all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been before .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of micro@@ seconds .
you &apos;ve also seen t@@ ack@@ y a little bit of evolution where he showed a little bit of evolution in the con@@ vol@@ ding program , right in front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve wa@@ g@@ ged the time scale again .
the first stage of the story that i told you , took a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the ner@@ ve system and the brain , la@@ sted a couple hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , la@@ sted less than a million years .
and those next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , would seem to take just a few decades .
the process fe@@ e@@ ds from itself , and it becomes , i think , car cat@@ aly@@ tical is the word for this -- if something co@@ vers its change speed .
but the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and that &apos;s , i think , that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explo@@ sion@@ ing cur@@ ve .
we &apos;re looking at the process that e@@ ats from itself .
i &apos;ve been living from construction of computers , and i know that i should build the mechanis@@ ms that i use to build computers , without the recent achie@@ vement in the computer technology .
my current activi@@ ties is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design those in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transi@@ st@@ or does in the making of this .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
what i &apos;m doing , and what makes the designers of ideas is , we think , a kind of abstra@@ ct level , ta@@ p this machine , and the machine , and make it something that goes far beyond our cap@@ abilities , better and faster than we could ever do it yourself .
and it does it in par@@ tly with metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t even understand until you &apos;re right now .
one way that &apos;s interesting is , especially interesting , and which i &apos;ve used a lot of time , is evolution itself .
so we put an evolutionary process in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the micro@@ second world .
so to give one example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that developed from random in@@ struc@@ tions .
we say , &quot; computer , gener@@ ic add in a hundred million rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ sen genes of in@@ struc@@ tions .
now , please take out all these random vot@@ es of ele@@ cted in@@ struc@@ tions , take all the programs , and choose those who my advantage are the previous ones that i &apos;m left with . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;ll be defined what i want .
let &apos;s say i &apos;d like to form numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve already used for this .
so , you find programs which can counter@@ act the most the first numbers .
of course , the chance of rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ sen in@@ struc@@ tions is very small that they &apos;re just concerned with rand@@ om@@ cases , so you don &apos;t actually get the in@@ struc@@ tions of that .
but one of those might like with some fortun@@ e to get two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computer , take those 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve come to the next place .
celebra@@ te that off , save the rest .
now all of the common causes that have sub@@ stit@@ u@@ ted numbers have contribu@@ ted the best .
and it &apos;s with a method of re@@ combin@@ ing , anal@@ o@@ g to re@@ production . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children ex@@ em@@ it the properties of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es from the two programs .
so i now have a new generation of programs that came out of com@@ mis@@ sions of programs that have something closer to the advantage than others .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot;
ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dat@@ ed it .
perhaps a couple of mu@@ tations .
and let &apos;s try this all again with another generation .
all of these generations need a few milli@@ seconds .
and so i can leave evolution over millions of years in the computer in a few minutes , or in a more complicated cases a few hours .
eventually , i &apos;m going to get programs that can be mas@@ s-@@ active .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;d ever could have written by hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to gras@@ p them .
it &apos;s de@@ lic@@ ate and strange programs .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you come from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that i &apos;ve done the job .
because your life depen@@ ded on whether they &apos;re doing the job right .
i sat down in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 together with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , ellen it contra@@ cted a map , and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s , in this airplane , there is hundreds of thousands of pieces that work together to make your flight sa@@ fer . &quot; don &apos;t you make that to you ? &quot;
we know that a process of development is not opti@@ mal when it gets to complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to leave on computers for a process that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es from classi@@ cal engineering function .
it allows us things to be a much higher complexity than the normal way of producing the normal way of producing .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the opportunities of that yet .
so , sort of , the technology is over@@ wh@@ el@@ med us .
so we use these programs to make the computers a lot faster , so that we can be able to make that process even faster .
so it buil@@ ds a feedback cycle .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so puzz@@ ling .
because all of these new technologies of themselves are fe@@ eding by themselves .
we &apos;re going down .
now we &apos;ve come at a point that anal@@ o@@ g is at the time , as a one-@@ cell organisms evolved to multiple cell organisms .
so we are the amo@@ e@@ els , and we can &apos;t quite do what the hell we &apos;re actually doing here are the design we &apos;re in .
we are in the middle of that over .
but i really believe that after us comes something else .
i find it very highly in@@ spir@@ ing by telling us that we &apos;re the end products of evolution .
and i believe all of us here are part of the creation of whatever comes next .
now , the lunch is standing before and i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m listening to here before i &apos;m going to pick up .
my story starts moving right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , about two years ago .
i was under the star@@ tu@@ p of desert in the desert with su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the era of the ancient indian e@@ po@@ s of &quot; ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a .
if we wanted to travel in indi@@ ans , we jum@@ ped into a car , and we s@@ nat@@ ched over the sky .
so now we &apos;re doing this with air@@ planes .
at the time , when the great indian war@@ ri@@ a war@@ ri@@ a had thir@@ ded , he took a bo@@ w , sho@@ ot@@ ed into the floor and water .
now we do that with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that the magic and magic have been re@@ placed by machines .
this really really got me sad .
i got some fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of technology .
it was fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of me that i could lose the ability to be able to enjoy sun@@ sets without camera and a t@@ we@@ et to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father had me to give me his little sil@@ ver ta@@ ir .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most i@@ vi@@ c thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world of pil@@ ate and un@@ expected ships and to images in my imagination .
it seemed like i had our reading and dream of che@@ ws and che@@ irs about it .
they thought they would be inspired by it .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use them ma@@ gi@@ cally rather than kill .
when i was 16 , i started to illu@@ strate books .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it a story@@ telling to story@@ telling that re@@ a@@ ders can connect around the world .
it can know how we usually do it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and descri@@ p@@ tions together , and anima@@ tion , sound and touch .
the story@@ telling has always used more sense .
but what are we doing with this ?
now i &apos;m just going to ka@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
here it says , &quot; put your fing@@ ers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here it says , &quot; that box has heard ... &quot; i &apos;m writing my name .
and it becomes me in a character in the book .
and then , a letter for me falls down -- and the i@@ pad knows through gps where i live -- which is right to me is really add@@ ressed .
the child in me is really enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic of these possibilities .
i talked a lot about ma@@ gical magic .
i don &apos;t mean ma@@ gi@@ cians and dra@@ ots , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
fire@@ flies in a glass i found constantly exciting .
that &apos;s how you &apos;ve got to shed the i@@ pad and let the fire@@ flies behind .
and the way they diff@@ er through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascin@@ ates me as a kid is that a whole galaxy can put a galaxy in a single mar@@ ble .
and so there will be every book , and every world a little mar@@ ble that i &apos;m just jum@@ ping here to the magic machine in the machine .
and that &apos;s what op@@ ens a map .
now fan@@ t@@ y@@ books had always been maps , but these cards were sta@@ tic .
this map gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and ser@@ ves to re@@ ori@@ entation in the rest of the book .
it shows you also in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
and also , it &apos;s important for me to create that in@@ dis@@ h is also very gradu@@ ally .
so these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
we &apos;ve all heard of fe@@ es and n@@ y@@ mp@@ s , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ bur@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ bur@@ as were caught for thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ a cham@@ bers in an old mu@@ tter book .
and we bring them back in a con@@ temporary story for kids .
a story that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
so for the future of environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , without going out of their computers , without going out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book you &apos;re sent to a search , you have to go out and collect and analy@@ ze with the camera of the i@@ pa@@ d of natural objects .
as a child , i had colle@@ ctions of nar@@ ro@@ ws , st@@ ones , bul@@ bs and sh@@ ells .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is a foun@@ ant ritual to get back , you have to go out to make a picture of a flo@@ wer in a chap@@ ter and tag a picture .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to photograph a piece of scan@@ ning , and tag@@ ging a piece of tree .
and so you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a fo@@ ster , and he says , &quot; oh , today i saw a co@@ a@@ che . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a mon@@ key today . &quot;
this creates a kind of a social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you &apos;ve actually colle@@ cted .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities that have ma@@ gical possibilities that connect the world and the technology .
and in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you used the video of the i@@ pad , and you see aug@@ mented reality showing an anima@@ tion of clo@@ r@@ es that appear on a plant before the house .
so , in one place , the screen is fil@@ ling with pages .
you &apos;ve got to do the sound of the win@@ ds , b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
we all move on a world where the forces of technology come closer and can happen in magic and technology in the magic and technology .
we &apos;re using the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you very much .
this is really quite an extraordinary honor to me .
i spend most of my time with people in rec@@ ru@@ it , pris@@ ons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the so@@ cially fru@@ it in the social market facili@@ ties and places where there are a lot of hope .
to be seen here at ted , to see and hear how stimul@@ ating this is , i gave me a lot of force .
in the short time here , i was clear to you : ted has a identity .
you can say things everywhere that have influence in the world .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it has a signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce and a force that doesn &apos;t exist otherwise .
i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
i think that we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher matter , but that the words of a de@@ dic@@ ated prac@@ tor are especially meaning@@ ful .
and as a physi@@ cian , you can do good , but you can do more than a care@@ ist , but you can do more .
and because of that , i want to talk about the power of identity .
by the way , i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a law@@ yer .
and i learned this from my grandmother .
i was raised in a family , an traditional african se@@ ven@@ -@@ american hou@@ se@@ hold , who was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ ch , and this matri@@ ar@@ in was my grandmother .
she was a ta@@ pe , strong woman , she had a responsibility .
she had the last word in every family argument .
she was also the starting point on many of our family tradi@@ tions .
she was the daughter of a sla@@ v@@ or family .
their parents were born in virg@@ ini@@ a in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s when sla@@ ves were born .
it was born around 18@@ 80 , and the experience of des@@ per@@ ately sha@@ ped their world image very stron@@ g@@ ly .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also very f@@ ond .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and i mur@@ gl@@ ed me .
she beat me so much that i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the , and then she let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you feel my hu@@ e ? &quot;
and when i said no , she hu@@ g me again , and when i said , she wor@@ e me . if i said , they decided to quie@@ t me .
she was something that wor@@ ged that you wanted to be near her .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cou@@ s@@ ins were around all around .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine , i wo@@ ke up one in the morning and went to the living room , all my cou@@ s@@ ins flo@@ ating around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room , and i star@@ ed at me .
and at first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and i s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious .
and that &apos;s 15 or 20 minutes , and then she went over and she came to me . she took me to the hand , and she said , &quot; come , br@@ y@@ an . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i just remember it was like it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
she took me outside , and he said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t let it go . &quot;
i said , &quot; let &apos;s forget , grand@@ a . &quot;
and she said , &quot; well , hon@@ ey ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat me down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve obser@@ ved you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a little special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you need to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , gran@@ ny . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , first of all , you &apos;re going to love your mom@@ s . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom@@ my is my baby , and you have to promise with you that you &apos;re always going to care for you . &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , i ad@@ mi@@ red my mother , so i &apos;m going , &quot; yeah , gran@@ ny , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , next thing i &apos;ll leave you will always do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to stop doing the right thing .
and i thought , &quot; yes , gran@@ ny , i promise . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is , you &apos;re not going to drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , gran@@ ny a . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up in the country , in the old south south , and i have a brother who is older one year and one year yo@@ unger nur@@ se .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and i took this son sitting be@@ er with my sister and i and i went to the forest and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just sitting around the same way as else .
and then he took a drink be@@ er and off@@ ered my sister one , and she accep@@ ted , and then they mat@@ ched me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . just you . i don &apos;t want to do a be@@ er . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to do that , you &apos;re doing everything else that we &apos;re doing .
i had what , your sister had what . go , drin@@ k was a be@@ er . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to go . do you . you just . &quot;
my brother started star@@ ing at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , drin@@ k . &quot;
and then he looked at me on the face , and he said , &quot; oh , no , you &apos;re not going to do crazy because of the conversation with gran@@ ny ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grand@@ ma spea@@ ks to all the ti@@ ckets that you are special . &quot;
and i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
i &apos;m going to thank you something .
i don &apos;t probably want to do that .
this may be medi@@ cally transpor@@ ting the public .
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m left that i &apos;ve never dr@@ un@@ k a drop of al@@ co@@ hol
i &apos;m not saying this because i believe it &apos;s virtu@@ ous . i say that because identity is making identity .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all of her grand@@ children , you &apos;re something special .
my grand@@ father was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
my un@@ cle died of al@@ co@@ hol hospit@@ onic diseases .
and she believed that these are the top@@ ics that we had to care about .
i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people were in gro@@ wer@@ ing and in ja@@ il .
today , it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states today have the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world .
seven million people are dis@@ mis@@ sed to jud@@ gment or with opposite law .
in my opini@@ on , cell@@ in@@ fu@@ ti@@ zation has changed our world most powered .
in social break@@ ish and black parts of the population of des@@ pair des@@ pair and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of these changes .
one out of three young black girls is in prison , in prison , in prison , on standar@@ ti@@ fication , or with un@@ condi@@ tional offi@@ ci@@ lation .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles over phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , in prison , on standar@@ ti@@ fication or with ignor@@ ed cri@@ deli@@ ty .
but our system is not only sculp@@ ted by questions that have to do with ra@@ d@@ ding , it &apos;s also repres@@ ented by poverty .
we live in this country a justi@@ tory system that is much better to treat , when they &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and inno@@ cent .
wealth , not de@@ bt , affec@@ ts the out@@ come .
yet , we seem to be quite happy about it .
now , a politics of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
so there &apos;s a couple of very interesting develop@@ ments .
my home state al@@ ab@@ ama puts them perman@@ ently when they &apos;re sent@@ en@@ ged to be sent@@ enced .
here in al@@ ab@@ ama , 3@@ 4 percent of male population of male population are rapi@@ dly losing their elec@@ tions right .
we &apos;re pro@@ cla@@ im@@ ing that in 10 years , the rate of recogni@@ tion of the ci@@ vi@@ c honest honest status is going to be as high as before the vot@@ ing of ele@@ ction law .
the sil@@ ence is o@@ bes@@ ous .
i negoti@@ ated kids .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that con@@ vi@@ cted three-@@ ten@@ ds to death in prison .
in this country , there are dea@@ ths of life without in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ation with li@@ tter law .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of proce@@ d@@ ure .
most of the country in the world .
i wit@@ n@@ essed people in death cells .
now the death pen@@ al@@ ty question is an interesting question .
we believe because we &apos;ve taught it so that the real question that is : has a human being deser@@ ved to die for him to die ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but again , you can think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not , has somebody ear@@ ns for a crime , but is we deser@@ ve to kill ?
and i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is re@@ defin@@ ed by er@@ ror .
on nine people we &apos;ve ex@@ ecu@@ ted , they come one that we found for inno@@ cent , that was de@@ pu@@ ted and left from the death floor .
an amazing er@@ ror program . one of the nine inno@@ cent .
and i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let somebody fly with an airplane , if for nine planes that falls down , down one down .
but somehow , we manage to stit@@ ch ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m a lot of these questions about these questions .
i talk about race , and the question is , can we kill the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m saving my students af@@ ro@@ american history . i &apos;m talking about sla@@ very .
i talk about terror@@ ism , the time against the end of the second re@@ construction , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a very much about it .
but for the afri@@ can@@ -@@ americans in this country , it was a time of ter@@ ror .
people had to have trouble in many areas had to have ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs .
or do it be against bom@@ bs .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror who sha@@ ped their life .
these older people are coming to me now and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re saying , they &apos;re saying to say that we have to do it for the first time in our nation with terror@@ ism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and , of course , after terror@@ ism , of course , the ra@@ ping and decades of the most tar@@ ge@@ t@@ y-@@ motiv@@ ated sub@@ mission and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
and yet , there is a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand the meaning of our actions in the histor@@ ic context .
we &apos;re always going to fit on each other .
we always do new ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
we &apos;re hard to talk about race , and i believe that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to approach the process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in south africa , people have understood that the am@@ pli@@ tion is not over cross is the will@@ ing@@ ness to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
even after the geno@@ cide in r@@ wand@@ a , there was this will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve held a few talks in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly dist@@ ur@@ bing to hear them . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and of course , they can never give them more in germany . &quot;
it became completely sil@@ ent , and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever have to address for the syste@@ matic kill of people .
it would be reas@@ on@@ able of us , consci@@ ously , consci@@ ously and able to reach people . &quot;
and i was thinking about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where the ger@@ man state brought people out , especially if there were a lot of je@@ ws under the outside .
it would be in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble .
it would be wor@@ th@@ less .
and yet , here in this country , in the old south states states , we tend to be sent@@ enced -- here &apos;s the risk of death , 11 times higher , when the vic@@ tim is white than if the vic@@ tim is white than if it &apos;s black . 22 times higher when the appropriate black is ro@@ ws and the vic@@ ti@@ ms -- in the same state states , where whose west are sha@@ king the body .
and yet , there is this mental dis@@ integra@@ te .
i think , our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
if we don &apos;t deal with it with these difficult top@@ ics , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we &apos;re love innovation .
we love technology , creativity and creativity .
we &apos;re love entertain@@ ment .
but ultimately , these reali@@ ties are f@@ used by suffering , ab@@ use , re@@ ab@@ ti@@ sion , opposite limit@@ ement .
i think it &apos;s important to bring both of them .
because we &apos;re ultimately talking about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commit@@ ment , to be in a complex world .
for me , to bring up this time to think and to talk about the poor that dis@@ advan@@ ces that are never going to be at ted .
but think in a way that is em@@ bed@@ ded in our own life .
so we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . we &apos;re so rational as we value intelle@@ ct .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t just come from our minds .
they come from ideas that are driven by per@@ su@@ asi@@ on in our he@@ arts .
it &apos;s this head@@ -@@ heart connection , where i think it &apos;s pus@@ hing us , not only to be open for all the light and ambi@@ tions of things , but also for the dark and proble@@ matic .
so vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ mic politicians , once said .
&quot; when we f@@ ought in eastern europe against supp@@ res@@ sion , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most was hope , hope , a par@@ ent , the will@@ ing@@ ness , the will@@ ing@@ ness , sometimes in hop@@ ary places , and be wit@@ ness . &quot;
this intellectual ori@@ entation is the heart of what i believe that the ted communities have to engage to do this .
there is no interven@@ tion about technology and design that allows us to be completely human , until we have eyes and e@@ ars for poverty , environmental limit@@ ation and in@@ justice .
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity doesn &apos;t assu@@ me a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t plan on it .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young law@@ yer , i hat@@ ed the great privi@@ lege to meet p@@ ink par@@ ks .
woman par@@ ks came back again to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery , where they were tra@@ il@@ ing two of their ol@@ dest friends . these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r , who had organized the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ i bus@@ bo@@ y@@ k@@ ot@@ t -- an incredible afri@@ can@@ -@@ american -- and virg@@ ini@@ a lang@@ r , a white custom@@ man , ji@@ ff@@ son ris@@ r , dr. king ep@@ at .
so these women were meeting , and they just stopped .
and then , mr. car@@ r called me and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ ack@@ y , m@@ art comes to the city . we want to talk .
do you want you to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , do very much . &quot;
and she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over , and i just stopped .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so it was so in@@ spir@@ ing .
and one day , i was sitting there , and i heard this women , and after a few hours , he re@@ turned to me , he said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what that &apos;s about for equal &quot; right .
what &apos;s going to try to achieve ? &quot;
so i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to make in@@ justice against ir@@ on .
w@@ r want to help people who were inno@@ cent in@@ ju@@ g@@ ence .
we want to fight bi@@ ases and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in crimin@@ al justice system .
we want to elimin@@ ate li@@ fel@@ ong sent@@ ences without the un@@ condi@@ tional law@@ suit for children .
we want to do something against the death pen@@ al@@ ty companies .
we want to reduce the number of pris@@ on@@ ers .
we want to rele@@ ase mass in@@ car@@ ti@@ zation . &quot;
so i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me , and i said , &quot; y@@ um . m@@ h@@ mm . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make it very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
and then , le@@ r , to me , le@@ r said to me , put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you need to be very , very bra@@ ve . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be tax@@ ler .
we need to connect ways . we have to connect to these challenges : this problem , this ti@@ lt .
because ultimately , our humanity , by our humanity , is depen@@ dent on our humanity .
so in my work , i learned very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of very simple things .
that we all are more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
when you lie , it &apos;s not just a li@@ ar .
when somebody kno@@ cks something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to him , it &apos;s not just a th@@ um@@ b .
even who kill@@ s someone , it &apos;s not just a mur@@ derer .
and because that &apos;s , there is a basic human dig@@ ni@@ ty that does have to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is dis@@ enti@@ tude .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s .
i think , in many places , the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dra@@ matic , so beautiful and in@@ spir@@ ing , we end up not in the end of our technology , not in the things that we develop , not in the things that we develop , not in our intelle@@ ct and minds .
after the end , a society is not measu@@ red by how they treated their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but by making them con@@ vi@@ cted with the poor , the in@@ fer@@ red .
because in this context , we &apos;re only beginning to gras@@ p the actual amazing things that make us out .
sometimes i forget balance . a story end at the end .
sometimes i &apos;m swi@@ t@@ ching too much .
i &apos;m going to be ti@@ red , like all of us .
sometimes these ideas are fore@@ ning our thinking in a very important way .
i negoti@@ ated these kids who were sent@@ enced to very hard pun@@ ish@@ ment .
i go to the local prison , and i visit a las@@ er who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that should be as an adult in court .
so i asked myself : how could this happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the ju@@ dge looks at him as a physi@@ cian , but i see a child .
one night , i sta@@ yed up too long , and i thought my goo@@ dness , if one ju@@ dge can turn us into something , then he has to have ma@@ mor@@ s .
in fact , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has ma@@ ts .
you should also want to give you some of them
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think really well , i started working on a pres@@ identi@@ al .
i had a 14@@ -year-old , poor black boys as a volunte@@ er .
and i started with that note , and the head@@ line said , &quot; remember , my poor , 14@@ -year-old black off@@ ers like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old national man@@ ager . &quot;
in my mind , i expla@@ ined that mis@@ actions of the government and poli@@ poli@@ tis@@ co are con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating con@@ dem@@ ning .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there was nothing more knowledge in this country that there was only fal@@ ds .
the next morning , i wo@@ ke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i dre@@ am@@ ed this crazy stat@@ ement or even written it .
and on my dis@@ car@@ ding , i had him not only written him , but also sent to the court .
a few months passed over , and i &apos;d just for@@ gotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i had to give myself into the cour@@ ts and this crazy case .
and i got into the car , and i was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
so i went to the front of the court .
and i thought that it &apos;s getting so heavy , so pain@@ ful .
finally , i broke out of my car , and i went up to the court .
when i got up the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court , there was an el@@ der@@ ly , black man who was the jan@@ it@@ or in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
then he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed me in the ear .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , it gave me power@@ s .
it made something very deep in me , identity , the ability of each individual , contribu@@ ting to a community to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i condu@@ cted the cour@@ c@@ room .
and as soon as the ju@@ dge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you express this crazy phr@@ ase ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; then we started discus@@ sing .
more and more people would come in , just because they were an@@ gry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and de@@ vot@@ ing con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on and office workers .
in the pal@@ m of people , the cour@@ tor@@ ium of people who were an@@ gry that we talked about skin color , about ine@@ quality , about ine@@ quality .
from my corner , i saw the jan@@ it@@ or and down the jan@@ it@@ or .
he kept seeing himself through the window , and he could hear the whole to@@ hu@@ li@@ dr@@ u .
he stood up and down .
finally , this older black man came in with a very concerned fac@@ ial out@@ turn in the cour@@ tro@@ om , and he was standing behind me , almost on the defen@@ se bank .
10 minutes later , the ju@@ dge announ@@ ced a break .
on the break , a police off@@ ic@@ er caught in the room who caused it to be the office in the cour@@ ch room .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black guy .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in the cour@@ der room ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to come to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
i came to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pen@@ k of the universe is increasing a long , but it &apos;s increasing the justice .
that we can &apos;t be completely developed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
that all of our lives is connected to the survival of each individual .
we need to connect our visi@@ ons of technology and design , of entertain@@ ment and creativity with humanity , p@@ ity and justice .
and most of all , i want to say , of those of you who see this as much , just say , lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you have seen this audience , this community to an obvious wish and to be able to help them and do something .
so what else can we do ?
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are possibilities all over the world .
if you &apos;re living in california , there &apos;s a cen@@ su@@ s in this spring that it &apos;s about actually to organi@@ ze a eff@@ or@@ ts to change something of the money that otherwise goes into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
here , in california , for example , a billion dollars in the next five years you &apos;re going to have a billion dollars for the death pen@@ al@@ ty . a billion dollars .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all hi@@ vation is not comp@@ ens@@ ated with a con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on .
fi@@ gh@@ te@@ en percent of ra@@ pe cases don &apos;t come in court .
here , there is a chance to do something .
this pres@@ ence is suggest@@ ing that saving money into more security produ@@ ces and alzheimer &apos;s security .
i think there are possibilities all over .
in the last three decades , dec@@ line rate is down im@@ men@@ se in america .
that the fact is often to a relationship with the el@@ ev@@ ated in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers .
what would you tell someone who belie@@ ves that ?
well , in fact , the number of violent cri@@ mes didn &apos;t change very much .
most of the mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country didn &apos;t really found in the class of violent crime .
it was the failed cr@@ us@@ s against drugs .
and so the dra@@ matic high paying numbers come in the prison pris@@ ers .
we sat down by pun@@ ishing from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
so now we have three con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts of &quot; three laws that people get for forever behind b@@ ars , for a bi@@ ke the@@ ft , for the the@@ ft of low good good , rather than that you forces them to give them back the vic@@ ti@@ ms .
i think we have to do more to help people who have become sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce vic@@ ti@@ ms , not less .
and i think our current pun@@ ish@@ ment of our current philosoph@@ y is not helping .
well , i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
now br@@ y@@ an , they did really have a string for pig@@ s .
they are an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
thank you very much you were at ted . thank you .
e-@@ left : is dead death kill@@ s a higher cure risk .
two : fam@@ ine in som@@ alia : give 3 : small@@ -@@ shar@@ p spra@@ y of the police .
his 4 : mal@@ my car@@ tel@@ le . he said 5 : dangerous jun@@ ting drive .
adam : social dec@@ line . seven : 65 dea@@ ths .
cambridge 8 : tsun@@ am@@ id war@@ ning . juli@@ 9 attac@@ ks
different speak@@ ers : drug war . mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
rec@@ ession . hang . ev@@ ening . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt .
crisis . death . it &apos;s disaster .
god : oh my god .
so these are just some of the cli@@ ps that i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the last six months -- it would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media pre@@ fer to show us normal subje@@ cts , because our minds are giving attention to these top@@ ics .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second of all , our senses are starting to start much more information than our brain ever can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first budget for all the information is part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ bes , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
so , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our pet dete@@ ctor .
it contribu@@ tes and takes through the whole information , looking for any cla@@ im@@ ing of dan@@ ger in our environment .
so if we look at the news , we pre@@ fer to look for negative new ima@@ ging .
and the old ada@@ ge , &quot; when it flo@@ ws , the demand gets the demand &quot; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that took us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that everybody thinks it &apos;s as bad the world as worse .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
perhaps that &apos;s the real thing .
maybe the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century by a series of forces we &apos;ve made through a series of forces , so stron@@ g@@ ly that it &apos;s possible to create a world of ab@@ und@@ ance in the next three decades
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , ra@@ ce , water and energy problems -- that we already have .
and as humans , we are much better at thinking about problems in very long ways , but they finally end up over@@ coming .
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so that we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has dou@@ bled more than dou@@ bled by inf@@ using average income states of the world population has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
child mortality has dec@@ um@@ it@@ ed by a tent@@ h .
the result is that diet , electricity transpor@@ tation and communication costs have a multiple amount of redu@@ ction .
steve pin@@ ker has shown us that we &apos;re now living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history .
and according to charles ken@@ ny , the liter@@ acy rate has ris@@ en from 25 percent to 80 percent over the last 1@@ 30 years .
we &apos;re living in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people for@@ got this .
and we keep our expec@@ tations contin@@ ually continu@@ ing .
in fact , we &apos;ve re@@ defined poverty .
consider that a great percentage of americans that live under poverty line , access to electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , telev@@ ks , telev@@ isi@@ ons , motor phones , condi@@ tional goods and cars .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists in the last century , the im@@ per@@ ators of the earth , would never have been able to dream these lux@@ ury goods .
the foundation for lots of these kinds of technologies create technologies , and these growing are ex@@ dynamic .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown us that every tool that becomes information technology , on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law &apos;s cur@@ ve , and the price performance profi@@ le is dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs in your po@@ cket about a million times less , and it &apos;s thousands times faster than a super@@ computer from the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
now , look at that cur@@ ve .
this is mo@@ or@@ es &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
pay attention to two things on this cur@@ ve .
first of all , it &apos;s been increasing -- in better times , war or peace , rec@@ ession , depression and high confli@@ cts , depression and high confli@@ cts .
this is the result of loo@@ se computers , the faster computers build faster computers
it &apos;s slo@@ wed down for none of our big problems .
also , despite your log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic base on the left , it &apos;s increasing up@@ wards .
so , the growth rate itself is acceler@@ ating .
and on this cur@@ ve , on the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available all of them .
&quot; machine , &quot; something that my friends at auto@@ des@@ k call &quot; compu@@ te computers , &quot; sensor@@ s and networks , robots , robots , 3d pr@@ inter@@ s that allow it to democra@@ ti@@ ze personal production on our planet , syn@@ thetic biology , fuel , vac@@ cin@@ ation and food , digital medicine , nan@@ o-@@ materials and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the vic@@ tory of the ib@@ m super@@ computer in &quot; rich . &quot;
that was the gran@@ dio@@ o .
i used to cur@@ ge the newspaper , and look for the best head@@ lines that i could find .
i love this one : &quot; wat@@ son con@@ tains human op@@ pon@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
so imagine that this artificial intelligence of every ow@@ ner is available to a mobile phone .
four years ago , ray kurz@@ weil , and i started a new university here at ted called &quot; sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university . &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies in , with a particular focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create companies , products , services and services that can &apos;t directly stream in a decade of the lives of the people .
think about that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
thir@@ te@@ en years ago , it would have been ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
today we can give up to do@@ zens of companies who &apos;ve made exactly this .
when i think of ab@@ und@@ ance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of lux@@ ury for anyone on the planet ; i think it &apos;s to create a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating sur@@ plus from pe@@ ar@@ s-@@ free goods .
so sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resource that self-@@ volun@@ t@@ ary force .
so here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ i@@ . in the middle of the 18@@ th century .
he &apos;s the guy left on the left .
he jo@@ ined the king from si@@ am for dinner .
na@@ po@@ le@@ on soldiers car@@ ried sil@@ ver bri@@ ps , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself , the gold she@@ et .
the king of si@@ an , however , had made al@@ umin@@ um be@@ ast
al@@ umin@@ um was the most pre@@ cious metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and plat@@ in .
this is why the dom@@ e of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent was made out of al@@ umin@@ um .
though al@@ umin@@ um takes 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it doesn &apos;t occu@@ r as p@@ ure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and si@@ bri@@ ties .
but then , the technology of electro@@ ly@@ se was developed , and made al@@ umin@@ um fe@@ eding so cheap that we use it with our thro@@ wing mental ment@@ ality .
then we &apos;re going to introdu@@ ce this analog@@ y into the future .
we &apos;re thinking of energy sc@@ ar@@ city today .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet that &apos;s 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ times more energy than we use every year .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy fi@@ ots every 8@@ 8 minutes on the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not sc@@ ar@@ city , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ bility .
and there &apos;s good news .
in that year , you &apos;ve managed to reduce the cost of solar electricity in india to 50 percent of the same power -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
solar power land@@ ed last year by 50 percent last year .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that by the end of this decade in the sun@@ ny industry in the sun@@ ny areas of the united states of solar , solar will cost six cents a k@@ ler as compared to 15 cents in the
and if we have a trans@@ mit@@ ted energy , then we will have water in ab@@ und@@ ance .
so let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan the vo@@ y@@ a@@ ger spac@@ ec@@ raft in 199@@ 0 , when it went by the saturn at saturn , went back to earth ?
he took it up a famous photograph . how was it ?
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet , which is 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent s@@ alt water , two percent is covered , and we fight at 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in about 10 or 20 years , but now .
they &apos;re new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ologi@@ es on the way , nan@@ o-@@ materials .
and from a conversation this morning with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ators of the do , i want to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission -- his technical school , the &quot; bro@@ ing@@ shot , &quot; and of which many of you may have heard . it &apos;s the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator in the student home .
it can create a thousand gall@@ ons of clean water a day from different sources -- whether it &apos;s sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- and all that for less than 2 cents a li@@ ter .
the front of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a col@@ a has just decided to start a major test project with a hundred un@@ its in developing countries .
and if it &apos;s all very well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a is going to apply this technology glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
this is technology &apos;s innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones as well .
you &apos;re my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to reach 70 percent accu@@ rate rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 20@@ 13 .
just consider that a mas@@ sac@@ i war@@ ri@@ or with a cell phone in the middle of kenya in kenya has a better mobile communic@@ ations than president re@@ ag@@ an passed 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smar@@ t@@ phones on google , you have more access to knowledge , and information as president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in ab@@ und@@ ance , like nobody could ever have predi@@ cted .
and it gets better , the things that you &apos;ve spent and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , h@@ d video and picture , libr@@ aries of books and music , libr@@ aries of books and music , technology to medical diagno@@ stics -- are now being em@@ pi@@ ti@@ zed and che@@ aper in your cell phone .
and best of all , it &apos;s probably what provi@@ des us in health care .
last month , i had the pleasure of the high-@@ quality foundation called the &quot; $ 10 milli@@ ell@@ ory tri@@ cor@@ d &quot; tri@@ cor@@ on &apos;s x prize .
we investi@@ gate teams around the world to connect all these technologies in a mobile phone so you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s puzz@@ le with ai , you can test pu@@ cken@@ , or whatever you can test your blood values .
and to win it , it has to produce a better diagno@@ sis than a team em@@ bed@@ ded medical doctors .
now , imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of health care .
if this device sequen@@ ced a r@@ ust or dna virus , which is not known , it &apos;s called the government admini@@ stration , and pre@@ v@@ ents a pan@@ de@@ mic before its ar@@ ray .
but now to the biggest force that we &apos;re going to lead to a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
and i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for the population .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar brand .
and just by the way , the biggest in@@ sur@@ ance against a population explosion is a better education and food in all the world .
in 2010 , we had so much connected under two billion people online .
by 20@@ 20 , we &apos;re going to reach two to five billion internet users .
three billion new parents we &apos;ve never heard about before are going to connect global communication .
what are these people to need ?
what are you going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to desire ?
and instead of economic quie@@ t , i think i see one of the greatest economic asse@@ tan@@ ts in history .
these people represent a few trillion dollars that are flo@@ wing into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be heal@@ thi@@ er by the use of the tri@@ co@@ der , and they &apos;re better educ@@ ated by the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by using the opportunity to com@@ bine 3d pr@@ inter@@ s and frequ@@ ent computers , and be so much more productive than ever .
so what can three billion farmers , healthy , well-@@ educ@@ ated , productive members of the people bring us us ?
how about a sentence of new , never before it was heard before .
how about that , you know , the op@@ pres@@ sed , wher@@ ever you are to give a voice to lock on it and make change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring with me ?
how about compli@@ ments we cannot predict that we can &apos;t even predict
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that little teams who are motiv@@ ated by passi@@ passi@@ sts and focused are motiv@@ ated to create extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and governments in the past .
i want to close with a story that really caught me forward .
there &apos;s a program that some people may know .
it &apos;s a game that is called the fol@@ dit .
it &apos;s been developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to explore how that protein is going to evol@@ ve .
now , by the end of its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical science .
so far , that was a problem for super@@ computers .
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors , and now is played now .
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it turns out that today , human pattern recogni@@ tion is better the proteins acting than the best super@@ computer .
and when these guys came and watched , who &apos;s the best prot@@ on cre@@ ator in the world , this wasn &apos;t a co-@@ professor , either a cal@@ tech student , it was someone from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who was working on the day as assi@@ stant to a re@@ q@@ al clin@@ ic , and at the time the best became the world was the world &apos;s un@@ tam@@ rier preser@@ val .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what i have im@@ men@@ se trust in our future is the fact that we today have more power than individuals to put us on the grand challenges of our planet .
we have access to the exponenti@@ al technology complex .
we have the passion of a di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
we have the capital of tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ pi@@ es .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to address the new challenges , and to do that what needs to do .
we expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
thank you very much .
i think that we need to campaign something against a shif@@ ting piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s beginning to a medical institution , and i think that &apos;s what i
and maybe i &apos;m going to be in the business for a long time , because i can allow myself to give me a piece of my own fal@@ se pre@@ c@@ ision to do this .
but before i get to the subject of my pres@@ entation , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why don &apos;t ?
we are close to the seas@@ on@@ ary , and we &apos;re moving to the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are a hundred of them .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; seem shor@@ tly and turns for statistics and to use them a great later team .
so i &apos;m going to work on a statisti@@ cs that i hope that most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we talk about one 300 if a sh@@ red@@ d of 300 hit .
that means the player is going to hit three out of 10 stro@@ kes .
that means the ball beat into the out@@ field , he falls up , he doesn &apos;t catch , and who has to take the ball trying to throw to the first stage , hasn &apos;t made it in time , and the run@@ ner was safe .
so three out of 10 .
do you know how do you call a 3@@ 00@@ th in special lea@@ gue baseball ?
well , really well , maybe an all@@ -@@ star .
do you know how you call a 4@@ 00@@ ter ?
that &apos;s someone who in the course is safe than 10 out .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y , as ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- the last major le@@ gue baseball player found that during a regular seas@@ on over 400 times .
let &apos;s trans@@ fer@@ ment to my world of medicine , where i feel more stran@@ ger , or maybe a little less perhaps with what i talked to about this .
if you want to think of a blind desire , and you &apos;re transl@@ ated to a oper@@ ator that is the average performance of 400 in blin@@ dness .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
if you add lives in a particular area , and you have a belo@@ ved people with dea@@ ced heart disease , and their hou@@ se@@ hold transl@@ ates that to a car@@ di@@ ologist whose average performance is 200 on the body pres@@ entation .
but , but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the top of the lim@@ b .
and it falls down a 25@@ 7 .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , should be a leader volunte@@ er , should be a licen@@ sing manufac@@ tur@@ ist ?
a-@@ thousand , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what a good surge@@ on or doctor or fit@@ m should be .
what we do , however , is that we inclu@@ de each of you , to be perfect to the world with being perfect .
never make a mistake , no one makes any sense about the details of how to do that .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in the medical school .
i was a forced obs@@ essi@@ ve student .
earlier in high school , a fellow collea@@ gue said that brian gold@@ man would learn for a b@@ old test .
and it certainly was .
and i learned in my little st@@ ages in the si@@ sters res@@ iden@@ ce at the tor@@ onto general hospital , way alone from here .
i learned everything memor@@ ize .
in my an@@ atom@@ ical lec@@ ction , i learned the orig@@ ins and the stac@@ ks of every muscle , every bran@@ ch of one ar@@ mor , which leads away from the a@@ or@@ ta , ob@@ sc@@ ure and ordinary differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ stics .
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ sh@@ re a@@ zt .
and all the time i &apos;d been colle@@ cting more and more .
and i was good , i was clo@@ sing with c@@ um lau@@ de .
and i left the medical college studying the notion that if i knew everything and i knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close to full as possible that i could im@@ it@@ ate to do this .
and it worked for a while until i met a woman &apos;s prin@@ ter .
i resi@@ sted a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto as a woman , as a woman , brought me into the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital .
at that moment i was ap@@ poin@@ ted car@@ di@@ ology plat@@ forms in car@@ di@@ ological service .
and it was my head , when the emergen@@ cy workers se@@ arch@@ ed car@@ di@@ ological ad@@ vice to study the emergen@@ cy patients .
and let &apos;s give feedback to my great@@ bi .
i studied my wife &apos;s pr@@ inter@@ s , and she was in brea@@ as@@ -up .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she made a gr@@ ant sound .
and when i lost their ch@@ est with the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear a kn@@ y sound on both sides , which told me that they had found under consi@@ stent heart failure .
this is a state where the heart fa@@ ils , instead of pump@@ ing the entire blood on , a part of the blood in the lung , soli@@ ls a part of the blood in the lung , so it &apos;s gradu@@ ally fil@@ ling , therefore , therefore , the shor@@ ten@@ ity .
and it wasn &apos;t a difficult to diagno@@ se diagno@@ sis .
and i made them up , and i took me to care .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine what we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water tab@@ lets , so that they &apos;re sle@@ eping the liquid .
and over a year and a half or two hours , they started to feel better .
i was really good at myself .
and i made my first mistakes ; i sent them home .
actually , i did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my birthday without my birthday .
i didn &apos;t take the audi@@ ences , and i did what i had to have a call , what had been a call to my best dan@@ ger to let it deal with him , so that he had had a chance to make a shot of his images .
and he knew her , he would have been able to control extra information to her .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i don &apos;t want to be the help of need to be poor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful , and i was able to take responsibility that i was doing so , and so i would have the capacity to care for my patients without necessarily having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
and by which i sent them home , i vot@@ ed a quie@@ t voice to me , who tried to say , &quot; gold@@ man , no good idea . do it . &quot;
in fact , it was so much to me so much self-@@ confidence that i asked the nur@@ se , who was going to run for women prin@@ ter , &quot; believe that it &apos;s okay when you went home ? &quot;
and the nur@@ se thought about it and said in a more iden@@ tical way , &quot; yeah , i think it will be good . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
so i tra@@ ded the inv@@ e@@ el@@ ers and an am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce and a res@@ cu@@ e volunte@@ ers , and i brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , that night i had this na@@ sty feeling in my sto@@ mach .
but i kept working on it .
and at the end of the day , i met my things , di@@ mming the hospital , and went home to the car park to go home , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
and there , another nur@@ se said , not the nur@@ se that had seen after woman prin@@ ter , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most of the alp@@ ance physi@@ cians i know .
other medical people fear that too , but the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical care is particularly special , because we see the patients only so ex@@ ert .
the three words , remember , remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient that she jum@@ ped home ? &quot;
asked the nur@@ se san@@ it@@ ist .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular do@@ main .
and so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about one hour after she got home she brought home after i had taken her home , collap@@ ses , and the family called 9@@ 11 , the res@@ m assi@@ stant brought them back to the emergen@@ cy station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous sho@@ ck .
she bar@@ ely brea@@ th@@ ed and was blue b@@ loo@@ ds .
the emergen@@ cy workers re@@ tali@@ ate all the str@@ ings .
they gave her blood pressure el@@ se@@ where .
they sent them to the tu@@ tor@@ ing machine .
i was sho@@ cked , and i was sho@@ cked to the inner .
and i lived through these roll@@ er@@ er@@ tic roll@@ ers , because it came after the slow sur@@ f , and i hop@@ ed it would re@@ cover it .
and after two , three days , it was clear that they never would never wake again .
she hadn &apos;t suff@@ ered a treat@@ able brain damage .
their family started spra@@ ying .
and over the next eight or nine days , they got to that .
you could go through the day at the first day -- &quot; woman prin@@ ts , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
they &apos;re saying you &apos;re the names of the people who never forget .
and that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever found this myself .
the next few weeks , i took belie@@ ves , and i first found myself the un@@ healthy sla@@ very that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not the kind of che@@ ap@@ ame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy sh@@ ame , if you give a secret of the best friend &apos;s pri@@ de , even though this one gro@@ ves on a fu@@ zz@@ y , and you get caught and the best friend is con@@ fron@@ ted one with the end , and you &apos;re we@@ asing that at the end , you don &apos;t make such a mistake again .
if you re@@ mind re@@ view , and you never make the fla@@ ws again .
that &apos;s the kind of per@@ pe@@ tual sh@@ ame .
so , the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you in the heart .
it &apos;s the one who tells you that not what you do not what you &apos;re doing , but you &apos;re bad .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my mem@@ ist , he was very pleas@@ ed .
he spoke with the family , and i &apos;m confi@@ dent he smo@@ sted the black@@ na , and it sure that i didn &apos;t su@@ ed .
but i asked myself all over these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why did i send them home ?
and then , my worst moments : how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i have been in medicine ?
slowly , but it was certainly constru@@ cted .
i began to feel better .
and then on a fri@@ ction day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds and the sun came out , and i might say i might feel better again .
and i worried that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ ction , and never re@@ com@@ men@@ ded a mistake , that the voice could prevent .
and she did it .
and i kept working on it .
and then this it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergen@@ cy center in a commun@@ al hospital in a commun@@ al hospital , and i intervie@@ wed a 25@@ -year-old man with a veter@@ in@@ y .
it was a lot lost , and i &apos;m in ir@@ on .
he was always showing up here .
i looked in the loo@@ p , and it was a little p@@ ink .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and i sent him on .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed on his b@@ ars .
two days later , i came to my next emergen@@ cy service , and my che@@ f@@ or asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the patient with the patient ? &quot;
and it turns out he &apos;s a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ i infe@@ ction .
he had a poten@@ tially vi@@ dangerous disease called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
you can google that , but it &apos;s not infe@@ ction by the whe@@ x , but the upp@@ er brea@@ thing way of the comple@@ ting of the tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t stop .
he got in@@ tra@@ ven@@ o@@ se anti-@@ bo@@ tic@@ a and re@@ ared a few days later .
and i went back through the same architec@@ ture of sh@@ ame and self-@@ dou@@ bt , felt pul@@ ling me , and went to work and went to work and re@@ ar to work and again and again .
in an emergen@@ cy layer , i have seen a blind fire for a blind .
already , a lot of this , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital , which at that time , there was only 14 patients a night .
and in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably no de@@ fe@@ ction in their treatment .
and at one point he thought he would have kid@@ ney ro@@ cks .
i mobili@@ zed the x-@@ ray of the kid@@ ney , when that was without refle@@ cting , my collea@@ gue resul@@ ted to the lower right sec@@ ure to the patient &apos;s right , and calling the oper@@ ators .
the other one had strong di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
i in@@ gr@@ essed flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dra@@ te him , and i asked my colleagues as well to ju@@ dge him .
and that did , and when he realized a con@@ sen@@ su@@ s in the right sector , he called the oper@@ ator .
and in both cases , surgery was surgery , and they were fine .
both of them were standing at me , especially asking me .
and i would be fortun@@ ate to tell you that my worst mistake was only in the first five years , what many of my colleagues argu@@ ed , but total non@@ sense .
some of my puzz@@ les were published in the last five years .
it &apos;s alone , it &apos;s hy@@ sten@@ ted and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and can talk about them , if i voice the quie@@ t voice that tells me what really doesn &apos;t find me , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so they &apos;re not going to fix the same ?
if i &apos;m keeping into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when &apos;s the last time that you heard of somebody who was talking about mis@@ li@@ sh@@ s about mis@@ line ?
oh yes , you go to a cock@@ tail party , and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your mistakes .
if i were to ask into a room full of colleagues and about their immedi@@ ate support , and i intervie@@ wed them what i just told you , i would probably not achieve the end of the second story , before it would really be aw@@ k@@ ward , somebody would hi@@ re a jo@@ ke , they would switch the top@@ ic and for@@ got the rest .
and in fact , when i or my colleagues know that an or@@ th@@ op@@ cap@@ s in my hospital had passed the wrong leg , they &apos;d think i had trouble look at him in the eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally cont@@ um@@ blan@@ ting of er@@ ror .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic posi@@ tions -- the ones who make mistakes and those that don &apos;t make any . those who con@@ stra@@ in@@ ate , those who con@@ stra@@ in the sleep of bad out@@ comes and good out@@ comes .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological reaction just like anti@@ bodies that attack a human .
and there is the idea that if we are to protect those who make mistakes from medicine , we stay to a sec@@ ure system .
but there are two problems in this .
in my 20 years of medical skills and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve built a personal medical study on medical mistakes and fal@@ ses , to make all my career for a first article so much to me for one of my first artic@@ les that i show for the tor@@ onto star to my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely inevi@@ t@@ ably un@@ consi@@ stent .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day is going to happen every day , where a group of 10 media is either a wrong or wrong , where hospitals are getting more and more round and are de@@ va@@ st@@ ated , or dead .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die about a vari@@ able can@@ adi@@ an .
in the united states , the instit@@ utes of medicine calcu@@ late the number at 100,000 .
these are both strong under@@ stat@@ ements , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the cru@@ x .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge know all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
we don &apos;t can get rid of it .
we have a cognitive er@@ ror , so that we can take a perfect disease proce@@ eding for a patient with breast pain .
and then i take the same patient with fun pain , and i squ@@ ee@@ ze it and i make it swe@@ at@@ y and i give a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ zed breath , and all of a sudden , the story is through con@@ temp@@ t with con@@ temp@@ t .
i &apos;m not taking the same line .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same way .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way .
all of this together are un@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able .
so if you take the system the way i &apos;ve been taught it , and put out all failed health experts , no one at the end of everybody is left .
and you know the dog about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst ancestors ?
in my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot; i have the hab@@ it to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from the res@@ cu@@ e memor@@ ers to the car@@ di@@ ologist to the car@@ di@@ ologist , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about your ? &quot; and then i show with the micro@@ phone .
and then her pu@@ p@@ ils , they po@@ pped , they arri@@ ve at their head , then they look down , and they slow hard , and start to tell to their stories .
you want to tell your stories . you want to share your stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i fo@@ unded . &quot;
what they need is an environment that makes them capable of it .
so what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physi@@ cian .
the new determin@@ ed physi@@ cian is a human , knows about his humanity , accep@@ ting it , not to make pri@@ de of mistakes , but gives everything from them to learn from them so that it can be passed on .
she divi@@ des her experience with others .
they &apos;re suppor@@ ting when others are talking about their mistakes .
and she shares other people &apos;s mistakes , not about fla@@ pping , but in a passionate , suppor@@ tive way that everybody &apos;s benef@@ iting .
and she works in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes that people fill the system with life , and when that &apos;s , people are also doing mistakes from time to time .
so that the system is evol@@ ving to create se@@ cu@@ ps that make it easier to find mistakes that people are inevi@@ table , and also also allowed to create wor@@ thy to support suppor@@ tive spaces where anyone who recogni@@ zes the health , also imag@@ ining things that can actually be re@@ war@@ ded , and can be re@@ war@@ ded , and especially for people like me who are making the mistakes and the at@@ ti@@ tion of that re@@ tali@@ ate .
so my name is brian gold@@ man .
i &apos;m the new prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ist .
i &apos;m a human . i do er@@ ror .
i &apos;m wrong . but i &apos;m trying to learn best to come out of it to ad@@ mit it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do from me , but i can live with it .
so , let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , a little idea .
it &apos;s transforma@@ ble kinds of values .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories of trying to use time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
you probably know that he was here in 18@@ 35 .
you might think that he would h@@ unt fin@@ ches , but that &apos;s not true .
basically , he colle@@ cted fish .
he described one of them as a very &quot; very common . &quot;
it was a p@@ ie rop@@ e .
by the &apos; 8@@ 0s , he was fis@@ hed in a grand style .
now it &apos;s in the red list of en@@ danger@@ ed species .
we &apos;ve heard this story many times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos , or by other places , it &apos;s not very special .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless we &apos;re still going to the gala@@ pa@@ gos .
we &apos;re still thinking that they &apos;re origin@@ ally .
the bre@@ ach@@ es still describe it as un@@ tou@@ ched .
so what happened here ?
the second story is to characteri@@ ze a different concept , the transforma@@ tional ta@@ st@@ ness .
because i experienced it when i was studying a la@@ go@@ on in the west in 197@@ 1 .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integra@@ te myself .
and i got a horri@@ ble sun@@ fire , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t exist from there .
it was my first sun@@ be@@ ard .
as you can see , the la@@ go@@ on was seas@@ oned and some man@@ gro@@ ves were rever@@ sed by some man@@ gro@@ ves .
there were tra@@ w@@ ning of about 20 in@@ ches , black ch@@ ie@@ f whit@@ e@@ kee@@ pers , a sub@@ form of the fe@@ pher@@ e .
the fis@@ hes of these sta@@ kes were very productive , and the fis@@ her@@ men were living well of stuff and made in ghana over@@ average .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish was s@@ hr@@ in@@ ked down to half of his size .
they gradu@@ ally exp@@ and five centi@@ meters .
they had been gene@@ tically re@@ sted .
it was still fis@@ hes .
the people were still happy .
and the fish also had the fortun@@ e to be still there .
so it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet it has changed .
my third little story tells me about my occu@@ pa@@ tion in the re@@ plac@@ ement of the brea@@ the@@ ast is@@ her@@ ic in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- even the beginning of the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe was fund@@ ed a lot of developing projects .
fis@@ her@@ ies were foreig@@ ned countries that caught 25@@ ,000 fish , the industrial fis@@ bs this quite beautiful ship called mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
i went on to do , and we made diver@@ sa@@ tions all over the south south sea , and especially in the ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i now know that it was the reason of the oceans .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of our college were we@@ ts , other animals who are connected to the reason .
most of the fish , the little dots on the ru@@ b@@ ble , the s@@ ni@@ ffer pi@@ le , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish .
basically , the reason arrived to de@@ ck , and then it was thro@@ wn back .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is getting very quick .
within a year , you &apos;re going to go through it , and then you start with the commercial fish .
the reason becomes changed . so in this case -- a hard reason or soft cor@@ als is going to be mu@@ ked .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they were not e@@ aten , they were thre@@ eping them away because they were dead .
once one , we started a live .
she wasn &apos;t sho@@ ot@@ ed yet .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of cra@@ cks is colle@@ cted by fis@@ her@@ men every time they go in areas that have never been flat .
but it &apos;s not being docum@@ ented .
we &apos;re changing the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we ada@@ pt our best values of the new level , and don &apos;t re@@ mind us of what there was .
if you gener@@ alize it , what happens is what happens .
there are some good things on the y-@@ axis : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of your country , the water supply .
over time it changes . it changes because for people , their actions are , of course , their actions .
every generation is looking at the images that you take at the beginning of your conscious life as a standard , and you &apos;re going to push all of it .
the difference is then percei@@ ved as a loss .
but they don &apos;t realize the previous los@@ ses .
it can give a order of change .
and eventually , they want to get the sel@@ ec@@ tive rema@@ ins .
that &apos;s now most of that is lar@@ gely our goal .
we want to get things that are van@@ ished or things that are not as much as they were .
you might think that the problem of people looking at people who , certainly , when they lived in predat@@ or societies , kill animals , and which was just aware of a few generations after what they had done .
because obviously an animal is going to be very common , once it dies very common before it dies .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of these bal@@ an@@ ced animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
over time , we &apos;re focused on the big animals , and in the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they &apos;re getting r@@ ar@@ er because we &apos;re harv@@ iting them .
over time , there &apos;s little fish left over time , and we think that &apos;s the value .
the question is , why people accept it .
well , because they didn &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , con@@ fir@@ m that it was really different .
you &apos;ll con@@ fir@@ m it , because the evidence , as you &apos;re demon@@ str@@ ating in an earlier form , are not as you would like to pun@@ ch the evidence .
there &apos;s , for instance , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that the report of a billi@@ on in this area can &apos;t be used in this area of big fishing , cannot be used , or fishing scientists don &apos;t normally be run because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in hospit@@ alized societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
that shows you the enor@@ m@@ ously important role that a marine prote@@ cted area can play .
because of the oce@@ an-@@ prote@@ cted areas , we &apos;re basically bringing the past back .
we re@@ je@@ ct the past that people cannot be able to understand , because the core values have changed and are very low .
so people can see a marine prote@@ cted area and that can benefit from the insi@@ ght that en@@ ables it to re@@ store their core values .
what about the people who are not possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the mi@@ d-@@ west , for example ?
here , i think the arts and the movie may fill the gap , as well as simu@@ lations .
this is the simul@@ ator of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
there was gra@@ ale there , there was gra@@ ale -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes and the mal@@ ples are probably remem@@ ber@@ ing &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people were tou@@ ched like this -- except from the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ y story , why were they so tou@@ ched by the picture of the ima@@ ging world ?
because it &apos;s a little bit in@@ j@@ ury that has disappe@@ ared in some way .
so , my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , the only one i &apos;ll give , is to c@@ amer@@ on , so he roll@@ s &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
thank you very much .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in commun@@ ist 0@@ germany , you had to , if you had a ty@@ bo@@ machine agre@@ ed to the government .
they also had to regi@@ ster a paper with pres@@ ent@@ y text from this ty@@ pe@@ writer .
the reason for this : the government could track back , where a text came from .
if they found an article with fal@@ se thought , they could find the cre@@ ator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west how anyone could do something like this , and how much that stimul@@ ated the re@@ co@@ very .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
but if you buy a new color prin@@ ter from the leading las@@ er prin@@ ts of the leading las@@ er prin@@ ts and print a page , this side has flas@@ hed yellow mark@@ s on each page , in a pattern that clearly made the page to come back on them and keep the prin@@ ter back on
this is what we &apos;re going to do today .
and nobody doesn &apos;t seem to re@@ cover about that .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three major sources of today online problems of exi@@ sting online problems .
now , let &apos;s take a look at what really happens in the world : we can divi@@ de the attack into categ@@ ories .
we &apos;ve got three main groups .
it &apos;s the online crimin@@ als .
for instance , here , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ w from k@@ ie@@ w in u@@ kra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these people deser@@ ve money .
they use online insu@@ sel@@ s to ear@@ n a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several well-@@ known cases of online milli@@ on@@ th , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ aries that make their money through attac@@ ks .
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ mir t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin from cam@@ tu in est@@ eland .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ bas@@ z .
ste@@ phen wat@@ son .
b@@ j@@ by@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
these are mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q@@ ar da@@ an@@ and and so on and so forth .
these people are getting online online , but they provi@@ ded it illegal , such as tro@@ j@@ ans used to cla@@ im money from our bank accoun@@ ts , while we &apos;re doing our online ban@@ king , or also key@@ log@@ ger who colle@@ cted our credit card information to the key@@ board while we buy over an infe@@ cted computer online as we buy over an infe@@ cted computer online .
the u.s. american intelligence service two months ago the s@@ wis@@ s accoun@@ ts from mr. sam ja@@ in here , and in this account was 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars when it was fro@@ zen .
mr. ja@@ in himself is open foot , the abo@@ ot@@ ing place is un@@ known .
and i want to argue that it &apos;s more likely today that we become vic@@ ti@@ ms of a online , than a bu@@ mor in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that it &apos;s going to get even worse .
in the future , most of the crime are going to be online .
the second biggest exi@@ sting group we can obser@@ ve today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sts about , an opini@@ on , or by their audience .
more like anony@@ mous , groups like anony@@ mous are raised over the last 12 months , and are one of the main players on the block of online attac@@ ks .
so , these are the three main issues : crimin@@ als who do it for money , fun@@ lo@@ cking activi@@ sts like anony@@ mous that contribu@@ tes resi@@ stance , but the last group are nations , governments that run the attac@@ ks .
it &apos;s dest@@ ining us , acci@@ dents like at@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
it shows you amazing what happens when governments attac@@ ish their own citizens .
reg@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a very high-@@ powered cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or it was it .
last fall last fall , it had to express in@@ sol@@ um@@ z , because hl@@ ine had been ha@@ cked .
somebody was cut in , and he was very ha@@ cked the system .
and last week , in a meeting with the du@@ tch government negoti@@ ation , i hi@@ red one of the more ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ators of this group asking if he liked it possible that because of the mer@@ in@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ cks people had died .
and his answer was yes , &quot; yes . &quot;
so , how does people die at con@@ sequence of a ball of these kinds ?
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation .
they &apos;re selling cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
what do you do with a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate ?
now , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate you need , if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with o-@@ l-@@ en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted fo@@ ods , for example .
now , we all use , or many of us , g@@ mail , or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially common in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign hol@@ ders like g@@ mail , because they know they can trust more than local families , and that they &apos;re en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted across g-@@ le connections , so the local government doesn &apos;t s@@ wing in their talks in their talks .
if you can do , if you go to a foreign foreign extreme .
cer@@ ti@@ fication of cer@@ ti@@ fication and ger@@ l@@ ord cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of pl@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
what about the arab spring and the things that &apos;s happened in eg@@ y@@ pt , for instance ?
now in eg@@ y@@ pt , the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy in apri@@ l in apri@@ l , 2011 , the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an intelligence police , and they found a lot of ac@@ tors .
and in these fil@@ es , a fol@@ der was called &quot; the edi@@ fish . &quot;
and in this fol@@ der , there was notes in germany that sold the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government some programs that had sold the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government that they -- in very substan@@ tial frame -- could capture all the communication of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens .
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
the commercial head@@ quar@@ ters quar@@ ter is right here .
so western governments provide func@@ tion@@ it@@ arian governments with aid tools so that they can access against their own citizens .
but today , western governments are helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago of the so-@@ called &quot; the state pir@@ ist , &quot; this was a tro@@ j@@ an who was used by ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to express their own citizens .
if you &apos;re sus@@ pos@@ ed in a crimin@@ al case , you &apos;re being stru@@ ck your phone .
but today , we are far beyond about that .
they &apos;re ta@@ pping their internet bon@@ ds .
they use tools like the state pi@@ j@@ ans to talk to their computer with a tro@@ j@@ an that allows them to monit@@ or their whole communication , listen to their online discus@@ sions , to collect their pas@@ s@@ words .
so , if we keep thinking about these things , the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a bra@@ ver citi@@ zen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about myself .
i don &apos;t have anything to hi@@ de . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
priv@@ acy has to be popular .
priv@@ acy is not debat@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
it &apos;s not a choice between priv@@ acy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between free@@ dom@@ s and control .
and as we like today , in 2003 , in our governments , is every law we give , is always every right that we &apos;ve always con@@ gest@@ ed forever .
and do we trust , trust ourselves , any future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions we need to emplo@@ y for the next 50 years .
it might seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ te bri@@ cks .
the first con@@ cre@@ te st@@ ones were produced in 18@@ 6@@ 8 , and caused a simple idea : mod@@ ul@@ es of c@@ ement with em@@ ph@@ ement that fit .
con@@ cre@@ te blocks became very quick the most en@@ danger@@ ed sphere in the world .
they were invi@@ ting us to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , a window at the other .
basically , the con@@ cre@@ te buil@@ der of our time has become the building block of our time .
nearly a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out of this .
it was called the &quot; auto@@ matic stone stone . &quot;
and within a few years , le@@ go moved in every hou@@ se@@ hold .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion ro@@ cks have produced -- or 75 ro@@ cks for each person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings .
and le@@ go could do it for everyone .
le@@ go basically has basically taken the con@@ cre@@ te block , the building block of the world , and made a building block for our imagination .
in the mean@@ time , in the same year , at the bell lab@@ s , the next revolution was announ@@ ced , the next building block .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic , stre@@ t@@ ched ti@@ cks to a world in which everything was inter@@ active .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allow us to build much bigger , complex circu@@ me , a bri@@ ck after another .
but there is a main difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t mention that that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of the engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing li@@ tt@@ ine@@ its .
so let me show you how they work .
li@@ tt@@ ity inter@@ its are electr@@ onic mod@@ ul@@ es that have a specific function .
they &apos;re pre@@ fer@@ red , light , clay , engine and sen@@ sor .
and the best part is that they connect with magne@@ ts together .
that &apos;s how they can &apos;t put them wrong .
the st@@ ones are color co@@ des .
green is er@@ ase , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is op@@ pos@@ ment and orange is c@@ able .
so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green together , and you can build very quickly around of massive cir@@ cles .
they &apos;re putting a blue house on a green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch in there , and so you &apos;ve created a little di@@ ke .
you take the switch out by a pul@@ smo@@ c@@ ul@@ um , which is here , and you &apos;ve made a little blind .
so if you put this bu@@ zz@@ er for an extra effect , and you create a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , li@@ tt@@ ue &apos;s actually is quite powerful .
instead of re@@ wir@@ ing or re@@ wired , li@@ tt@@ inger allows them to code , to code , to code with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so to acceler@@ ate the blin@@ k or slow it down , they just throw out on that butt@@ on , and it makes the impul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ ue &apos;s its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to put every single interaction in the world into a us@@ er-@@ hand@@ ed rock .
lights , notes , solar elements , mot@@ ors -- all should be available .
we re@@ duced li@@ tt@@ leb@@ es to kids , and we see playing with it .
and it was an un@@ belie@@ vable experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how you start the electr@@ on@@ ics that they &apos;re surro@@ unded in the everyday course , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , works a night of ni@@ ce , or why the do@@ ors sta@@ ys on the back , or re@@ acting an ipo@@ d like a touch .
we also brought li@@ tt@@ ue its to design schools .
so , for example , we had designer with designers with no experience in electr@@ onic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ yle &apos;s eyes as a tool .
and here we see , with pain@@ t@@ ings , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ the the ...
a few weeks ago , we got li@@ tt@@ ine@@ its to ris@@ d , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just car@@ ton , wood and paper -- and said , &quot; do what . &quot;
this is an example of a project that they did , a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ controlled arr@@ ange@@ ment can@@ n@@ on .
but wait , this one is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a bu@@ mer from pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , which has fear in the dar@@ k@@ ness .
for these non-@@ engineer , li@@ tt@@ ue g@@ her@@ s became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became just another material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone available .
so li@@ tt@@ ue &apos;s open source is li@@ tt@@ thei@@ zed .
you can go to the website , you can down@@ load all the design elements and make them yourself .
we want the world of the educ@@ ators , the inv@@ ent@@ or , contribu@@ ting to contribu@@ tive , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , bel@@ on@@ gs to us .
so , go away and start to inv@@ ent .
thank you very much .
