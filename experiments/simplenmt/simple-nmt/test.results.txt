you know , one of the great reasons about travel@@ ing and one of the pleas@@ ures in eth@@ no@@ graph@@ ical research is to be living with the people who are still waiting at the old days , and that their past still sen@@ ds in the wind , and they &apos;re still tou@@ ched on the ed@@ ges of birds , ta@@ king them in the bit@@ ter blo@@ ws of plants .
just the reason why ja@@ gu@@ ar pr@@ ag@@ ans are still travel@@ ing beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the meaning of the my@@ ths of the ol@@ dest of the in@@ u@@ it of in@@ u@@ it , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as the budd@@ hi@@ sts still follow the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , is the idea that the world in which we live , not to be in an absolute sense , but only as a model of reality , as a con@@ sequence that the world in which we live , as a result of a group of certain possibilities of adap@@ tation that we have , which our minds are going to be successful , before a lot of generations , a lot of generations .
and , of course , we all share the same adap@@ tation .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
we &apos;re running through the initi@@ ation ritu@@ als .
we need to exp@@ and ourselves with the inevi@@ table separ@@ ation , and so we shouldn &apos;t surprise ourselves that we &apos;re all sing@@ ing , dan@@ cing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique sound of the love , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the pen@@ an in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ink miles in haiti , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ink desert in the front of the sahar@@ a desert , or a car@@ ne@@ sla@@ s in the sahar@@ a desert . this is the colum@@ ner , which happens to be travel@@ ed in the desert of a month ago , or even a y@@ r she@@ pher@@ d to the thr@@ ess of q@@ om@@ ol@@ a , ever@@ est , the go@@ d@@ mother &apos;s go@@ d@@ mother in the world .
all these people teach us that there are still other ways of thinking about other people , other ways of ori@@ entation on the earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , you can only finish you with hope .
together , the vast cultures of the world is a network of spi@@ ritual and cultural life , which is the earth , and for the universe , as important as the biological food grid , which you know as bio@@ sphere , which is the biological food grid you know as a bio@@ sphere .
you can think of this cultural life web as an eth@@ no@@ sphere . eth@@ no@@ sphere can be the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths and intui@@ tions that have been em@@ bed@@ ded by the human imagination since the beginn@@ ings of consciousness , which are defined by the beginn@@ ings of consciousness .
eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of human beings .
it is the symbol of all of what we are , and what we &apos;re doing as an ast@@ on@@ ishing species , is possible .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been strong , it happened with eth@@ no@@ sphere -- except even more larger speed .
no biolog@@ ist , for example , would argue that 50 percent or more of all species are due to extin@@ ction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ um in the field of biological diversity -- almost what &apos;s known to us . and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ um in the field of biological diversity -- is almost what &apos;s known to us as a most optimi@@ stic scen@@ ari@@ um in the real@@ m of
and the key indi@@ c@@ ator for this is the extin@@ ction extin@@ ction .
as any of you had been born in this room , 6@@ ,000 languages were spo@@ ken on the earth .
now , a language is not just the whole vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ graph@@ s .
a language is a phr@@ ase of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means of which the sou@@ l of a certain culture has access to the material world .
each language is like an ol@@ d-@@ breaking forest of the spirit , a turning point , an idea , a system of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages today , while we are here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , the only half no longer has been covered into the e@@ ars of kids .
they &apos;re not taught to teach small kids , and that is , if nothing is being done , they &apos;re actually already dead .
what might be more sub@@ tle than being used to being heard of sil@@ ence , one of the last euro@@ s that speak your language , no opportunity to have no opportunity to continue the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect children ?
and yet , this terrible dest@@ in@@ y actually re@@ moves someone anywhere on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , a el@@ der@@ ly man dies , and takes the last sc@@ elt of an old language into the gra@@ ve .
and i know some of you know , &quot; well , isn &apos;t it possible ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be a better place if we all speak one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be talking , let &apos;s be this language , yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s be ug@@ ly . &quot;
let be be the fau@@ i . &quot;
and then they suddenly realized what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t talk to your own language .
so i &apos;d like to sort of take you on a journey through eth@@ no@@ sphere , a quick journey through eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to understand what &apos;s actually been lost about .
now there are some of us who forget a lot that i say when i say &quot; different op@@ tions of being , &quot; really different op@@ tions of my own .
take for example , this kid of the bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west sou@@ th@@ west , the people of the an@@ a@@ kon@@ da , believe that they came up with my@@ th@@ ological to the east temper@@ e@@ ge of the city in the bel@@ ly of sa@@ ir@@ y sna@@ kes .
this is a people that doesn &apos;t cogni@@ tively be cogni@@ tively living between the colors of blue and green , because the sky is the forest that the people dep@@ end on .
they have a distin@@ ct language , and a privi@@ le@@ writer is called l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ bec@@ am@@ ie : you have to mar@@ ry somebody who &apos;s talking about a different language .
all this ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , which is a strange part of those big houses , where the mix@@ ing of the ele@@ ction is six or seven languages , but it is that you never listen to somebody who lear@@ ns a language .
they only listen to each other , and then start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the or@@ or@@ an@@ i in ecu@@ ad@@ or , an amazing people who had been cont@@ ac@@ ted in the 194@@ 8 pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful contact in 195@@
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ pres@@ sion@@ ary cont@@ ents tried and made a great er@@ ror .
they were fil@@ ling out sh@@ in@@ y photos of the air , which we would find as a friend@@ ly gest@@ ure , and so they for@@ got that these people from the rain@@ forest in their life had never seen something two-@@ dimensional .
she pulled these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the figure , didn &apos;t find anything , and conclu@@ ded that this is business maps of de@@ vil , and killing the five mis@@ sions with the spe@@ er .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i wasn &apos;t just killing the out@@ come with the spe@@ er .
they had each other . they were inter@@ rup@@ ted .
5@@ 4 percent of the dea@@ ths of death is due to dis@@ hes .
we went back to the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people about re@@ plac@@ ement , they ad@@ ded that one of the people had gotten so old that he died during his old age , and we still laugh@@ ed it with the spe@@ er .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest , which was amazing .
her h@@ unter@@ s could smell the ur@@ lin of a living from 40 steps away , and deter@@ mine what animals were ow@@ ned about those .
i got a really amazing task in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s when i asked my professor at harvard , if i was interested in this to go to haiti , and to syn@@ fil@@ tra@@ te the secret societies , which were the foundation of the strength of du@@ v@@ ali@@ ans and clay ma@@ bu@@ tes , and the po@@ ison that was used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
so to give you a sense of mind , i had to say something about these remarkable faith of vo@@ ki knowledge and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a cul@@ t of black magic .
in the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view .
it &apos;s an interesting thing .
so , if i asked you to count the great world subje@@ cts , what would you say ?
chri@@ sti@@ an , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism or whatever .
a continent is always re@@ lie@@ ved , because the sus@@ pe@@ ction was that in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , there is no religious faith , and of course there was no religious faith , and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the rema@@ ins of these very profound religious thoughts that had occur@@ red during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sla@@ ll .
but what vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is so interesting is this vi@@ vid relationship between the living and the dead .
the living los@@ ses are the spi@@ gers .
the spi@@ gers can be tra@@ pped by the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of dance to over@@ date the sou@@ l of the living , so that the ac@@ ute th is for a short act moment to god , so that the ac@@ ute th is going
anti@@ co@@ do@@ o@@ i@@ sts like to say , &quot; your white wal@@ ks into church and talking about god .
we dance in temp@@ le and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re going to get away from your mind . how can you be used to failure ?
and look at this amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o gab@@ ink in an ultra@@ log@@ ance , the red coal , expres@@ sing the glo@@ ck of no accident , an amazing illu@@ stration of the ability of the mind to affect the body that it causes when it comes into a state of extreme er@@ ou@@ cation .
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met were the kog@@ i from the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia , the most remarkable .
the ancient ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ an civilization , which popul@@ ated the car@@ bi@@ an co@@ ast@@ al mass of col@@ om@@ bia , and in a series of de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , this group fell back into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ vely that goes back across the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al floor .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ line continent , these people were the only ones who had never been ob@@ tain@@ ed by the sp@@ ani@@ fs .
until the day , they &apos;re gover@@ ned by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , and the training for pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is very extraordinary .
the young ac@@ yn@@ ards are separ@@ ated by their families at age three and four years away from their families , and in a sha@@ ping world of the foun@@ in@@ er for 18 years , in stone h@@ unter , for 18 years , inten@@ ded in stone bu@@ ck@@ ers for 18 years . two times by the age of nine years old , they were now spending me@@ tam@@ or@@ ph@@ i in the la@@ p of the preg@@ nant mother , so they now spend me@@ tam@@ or@@ ph@@ or@@ i la@@ id in the la@@ p of the great mother .
and throughout this entire period of time , they &apos;re going to be cul@@ tur@@ ally enga@@ ged in terms of their society , values that assu@@ me that their pra@@ yers and only their pra@@ yers , the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we might say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- or we might say , the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- as a balance .
at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , you &apos;ll suddenly take out one day , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sun@@ rise . and in this cr@@ y@@ y@@ al moment of consciousness , when the sun starts breaking on the edge of the ast@@ on@@ ishing beautiful landscape , suddenly everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstra@@ ct of beautiful beautiful , suddenly everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstra@@ ct of the world , suddenly , and the pri@@ est is coming back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really how i told you . &quot;
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call up the older brothers , and they say we &apos;re the yo@@ unger brothers to be responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
every time we think about dom@@ esti@@ sting and landscape , we either choose r@@ ous@@ se@@ bo and the old sk@@ ir@@ t of the no@@ ble po@@ cks , which is in its simpli@@ stic thought , in its simpli@@ of simpli@@ stic thought , or th@@ ore@@ au , and say , these people are more with nature than we are
so , in dom@@ esti@@ c , nei@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ ment@@ ation , they &apos;re still li@@ f@@ ted by the no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
there isn &apos;t a lot of space to do this in the malari@@ al b@@ elt of as@@ m@@ at or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they &apos;re still sha@@ ped through time and ritual a secret ni@@ m@@ bu@@ o of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being consci@@ ously close , but on a far more sub@@ tle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ed into the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child from the front that gro@@ ws in belie@@ fs is that the mountain is an a@@ pu@@ tu spirit , which is going to be a very different person or her dest@@ in@@ y , will be a very different human being , and having a different relationship with that resource or a different relationship , as a baby of mon@@ tan@@ a , which gro@@ ws in the belief , that a mountain is a bunch of st@@ res@@ ses that can be de@@ f@@ ated .
whether or educ@@ ate a spirit in a spirit or a pi@@ le is ir@@ relevant .
and what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of british col@@ om@@ bia , and i felt that these fore@@ sts are there to be bur@@ ned .
and this led me to another person as my friends under the k@@ wa@@ ch@@ u@@ t@@ l , who believe that those fore@@ sts of hu@@ ku@@ k and the gay sou@@ p and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ gic spirit are the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ gic spirit , the spi@@ ri@@ tors they were facing the world , spi@@ sters , they would partner at their ha@@ x publi@@ sh@@ ment .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of your extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photo i took just last apri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the stron@@ gest psycho@@ active response from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of the sha@@ go@@ an .
now , what ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca does so fascinating is not just the pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical potential of this pre@@ par@@ te , but this process@@ ing . it &apos;s really made out of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this woo@@ den li@@ an@@ e , which is a series of be@@ ta@@ ple@@ d@@ ine , har@@ m@@ in , har@@ mo@@ lin , slightly hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen , bat@@ t@@ ings , and these fli@@ ps of wood is like a blue gul@@ f on its consciousness , but it &apos;s equivalent to the she@@ ets of a wall of the coffee of the coffee plant with the psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is . it &apos;s mix@@ ing with the she@@ ets of a hall from the coffee plant of the
and this plant inclu@@ des some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ v@@ ine that ser@@ ves the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ zer@@ y@@ tr@@ ine , 5 and metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ m yl@@ ab@@ yp@@ rus .
and if you &apos;ve seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ ma@@ i , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this sub@@ stance that you create from various species , you also have a metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ id yl@@ ab@@ yp@@ osau@@ in .
the po@@ d@@ der is to pick up something like a car@@ rot , and it &apos;s kind of flo@@ wed by b@@ aro@@ t pain@@ t@@ ings , and the land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
it will create no limit@@ ation of reality , but it &apos;s the resol@@ ution of reality .
in fact , i &apos;ve even been with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes , the man who introduced the psy@@ gi@@ an re@@ re@@ a in mexico in the 3@@ 0s , discus@@ sed it . i argu@@ ed that if you could not interven@@ e this tr@@ yp@@ osau@@ ine as a hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen , because , at the moment , you feel like you &apos;re no more hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen , you know , you &apos;re no longer there to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ards is that they can &apos;t be bo@@ unded because it &apos;s naturally due to a human being of course , because of course , through mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase , it will be den@@ ri@@ fied .
they can only be contain@@ ed with some other chemicals , which can den@@ at@@ ate the ma@@ o .
now , the fascinating thing is that the be@@ am@@ -@@ in-@@ be in the li@@ an@@ e , ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of exactly the same species , are necessary to poten@@ n the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . ask yourself .
how can these people from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species , these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ related plants , find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally related plants , which , if in this way combin@@ ed in this way , creating some kind of bio@@ chemical version , so that &apos;s the whole larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , and we try and er@@ ror , which is more meaning@@ ful .
but if you ask the indi@@ ans , they say , &quot; the plant spea@@ ks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 vari@@ ations of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which you all recognize at a vast distance in the wo@@ ods that look for our eyes as a species .
and then they ask them how they present their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything at all ? &apos; &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out that every one of those 17 var@@ ie@@ ties takes you to full moon , and they sing one in a different note .
now , this doesn &apos;t take you a ph@@ .@@ d. student at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than coun@@ ting tri@@ ya .
well , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sym@@ pathy for the difficult position of indi@@ ans , you look at them as an or@@ g@@ ani@@ al and color@@ ful , but they sort of nar@@ row on the past , as the real world , which is our world , is continu@@ ed .
so , the fact is that the 20th century , in 300 years , didn &apos;t remember for its war or technologi@@ cal innovation , but rather than a period of age in which we &apos;ve been against , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth is either invest@@ ed or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted on earth , so the problem is not the change .
all the cultures have been involved in the dance with new ways of living .
and the problem is not the technology of itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans never bel@@ ong to be less at si@@ ou@@ x when they &apos;re bo@@ w and inti@@ f issues when americans stopped to be americans when they &apos;re horse and hor@@ ks of sle@@ eping tas@@ ks .
not change and technology thre@@ at@@ ure the integri@@ ty of eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . it &apos;s ug@@ ly face of the g@@ ad@@ mo@@ ve .
and wher@@ ever you look around the world , you &apos;ll find that these cultures are not inclu@@ ded , and these are dynam@@ ically living peop@@ les whose existence is going to dep@@ end on their existence , or whether it &apos;s a tremendous de@@ dic@@ ation in the middle of the city , which is a no@@ ma@@ de people in sou@@ an , an no@@ ma@@ de people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , an no@@ ma@@ de people from a generation of mine in the forest , and now to c@@ au@@ ght and pro@@ stit@@ ution at the floor of the river , from where you can see that even the river is going to s@@ hr@@ ink out their ships , which is almost half bor@@ ne@@ o in the south african ocean , where the japanese vie@@ wers are ready to fill up their ships with ro@@ ws of trees that they have dis@@ rup@@ ted to the forest , or the fall of the y@@ an@@ o@@ dor@@ i , where there are g@@ es@@ str@@ ates in the field of the na@@ an@@ o@@ mom@@ i
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i have a lot of exc@@ und@@ ant , you &apos;ll see the ug@@ ly face of the political domin@@ ance .
you know , the geno@@ cian , the physical extin@@ ction of people &apos;s physical extin@@ ction is generally con@@ vi@@ cted , but the eth@@ no@@ ci@@ d , the destruction of the lives of people , will not only be con@@ vi@@ cted , but generally , in general and multiple , as part of a develop@@ mental policy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of suffering if you &apos;ve seen it at the bottom of the ground .
i travel@@ ed with a young collea@@ gue , 6@@ ,000 miles of ch@@ eng@@ du in west china , and only when i came to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you listen to l@@ has@@ a , and i saw the face of which you hear about the statistics of which you were going to be mur@@ dered and turned by , 1.@@ 2 million people who were mur@@ dered by the c@@ attle in the cultural
the father of this young man was identi@@ fied as a follo@@ wer of the hall .
and that meant that during the chinese invasi@@ on , it meant that he had been mur@@ dered immediately .
his un@@ cle fle@@ w in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a with her sa@@ y@@ al@@ a , who brought people to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was lo@@ cked in , as pun@@ ish@@ ment for -- to be a pro@@ gr@@ ession for being weal@@ thy
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ ged in prison for two years to hi@@ de under her rock@@ ce@@ nu@@ l , because she couldn &apos;t live it .
the sister who ser@@ ved these ta@@ st@@ ers were brought into an edu@@ cational camp .
and one day , she tra@@ pped on a shop band of ma@@ os , and she had to do that for seven years into a sever@@ e labor camp .
the suffering can be in@@ toler@@ able , but the per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve spirit of people is a bit un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
and at the end of it , we really are in front of a choice . do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity , or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , who said great anthropo@@ log@@ ist , before she died that it was her greatest fear , that as we move into a st@@ res@@ sing , gra@@ pid , gener@@ ic world@@ view , we were not just going to see the entire range of human imagination in an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed way , but we &apos;ve for@@ ited one day in a dream , and we for@@ got out of a dream , and we &apos;ve for@@ gotten that there have never been other possibilities .
and it &apos;s hu@@ mili@@ ous to think that maybe our species exi@@ sted has exi@@ sted for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution , which brought us to agriculture , and at that moment , the cul@@ t of the sa@@ pe , the poetry of the sha@@ man by the pro@@ se of the p@@ rie@@ zen@@ ship , and hier@@ arch@@ y , speci@@ alization , speci@@ alization -- were only found 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world , as we know it , is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
well , this big story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers on the challenges we face in the next mil@@ len@@ nia .
if we ask these limited world cultures for the meaning of human being , it answers with 10,000 different vot@@ es .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to re@@ discover the possibility of what we are : people with sever@@ e consciousness , who are aware of the importance that all humans and gar@@ dens have to be em@@ bed@@ ded , that all humans and gar@@ dens of optimis@@ m have to be em@@ bed@@ ded . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
this is a photo i took up at the northern end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands , when i went to the nar@@ el@@ ar ja@@ g@@ d , and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a beautiful story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always moved very well with the in@@ u@@ it , and in the &apos; 50@@ 0s , our de@@ dic@@ ation of our bun@@ ks , they were forced to pull in sett@@ le@@ ments .
the grand@@ father of this old man was re@@ f@@ used to fight .
and the family , the fear of his life , took him all the g@@ uns and all the tools .
now , you have to know that the in@@ u@@ it is not afraid of the cold , they used it to their advantage .
the contr@@ es of their thro@@ wn were origin@@ ally wra@@ pped out of fish that was wra@@ pped in car@@ bu@@ a skin .
the grand@@ father of the man was not afraid of the arc@@ tic night or the stor@@ m of stor@@ m .
he st@@ um@@ bled out , she left his pants out of se@@ ed and ra@@ ped in his hand , and when the fe@@ ces began to free@@ ze her , he formed them in the form of a cli@@ p@@ al .
he was spra@@ ying ta@@ x on the side of the gy@@ r@@ als , and when it was completely fro@@ zen , he was ama@@ zed with a dog with it .
he gave the dog impro@@ vis@@ ed and impro@@ vis@@ ed a dis@@ h , took the skelet@@ on of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ing a go@@ od@@ back , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed another dog , and kno@@ ck over the ice she@@ ets with the woo@@ den kni@@ fe on the h@@ ink .
that &apos;s the way you can do anything .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resi@@ stance of the in@@ u@@ it and all of the exi@@ sting americans in the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government gave rise to the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l in 199@@ 9 in 199@@ 9 , which is bigger than california and texas combin@@ ed .
it &apos;s our new home country , and is called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ our@@ ter .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controll@@ ing all the miner@@ als .
an ast@@ on@@ ishing example of how a nation , a state , that can be se@@ arch@@ ed with its contain@@ ers and can be able to reach and reach
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve travel@@ ed to these dist@@ ant goals of the earth , recogni@@ zing that they &apos;re not at all away at all .
they are the countries of somebody &apos;s village .
they represent parts of the human imagination that goes back in the past period , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids will , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think politicians never reach@@ es something .
we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs is not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we think that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we probably are the best institution for story@@ telling in the world . our website makes 35 million brilliant stories every month .
15@@ 6 nations , we send our television chan@@ nel .
our new@@ spa@@ pers are read by millions of months .
and we &apos;re enter@@ ing a number of jour@@ ings into eth@@ no@@ sphere where we take our audience in places like such cultural films , and hopefully , you will consider one of the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y : that this world deser@@ ves the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y : that this world deser@@ ves to be in many ways that we can find a living opportunity in a really mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural world , where the wisdom of all people can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
thanks very much .
one of the things that i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology we have of microsoft as part of a year ago . that is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment where either you can deal with the size of visual data or away with vast amo@@ unts of visual data .
we see lots of , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photographs here , which you get se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and contin@@ ually , and you can see , in any way re-@@ assem@@ bly .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these colle@@ ctions are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital images of a camera , but this one here , for example , is a scan from the library of con@@ gress , and it &apos;s in a region of 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ sky .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that can push the performance of a system like this is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen in every single moment , and it also has a very flexi@@ ble architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-@@ ima@@ ging data .
this is b@@ lea@@ k &apos;s house of thi@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
to prove to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about an image , we can do something like this , to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the tex@@ ture and it &apos;s not an image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
this is a more more reali@@ stic case . this is a copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
and every big image is the beginning of a spli@@ t .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real paper sentence or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several sc@@ ales of scale .
we also did something on the corner of this particular exhi@@ bi@@ tion of the guar@@ di@@ an .
we &apos;ve designed a fal@@ se re@@ view with very high resol@@ ution , which is much higher than at a normal ad , and we &apos;ve ad@@ ded more content .
if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of this car , you can see you here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
and this really su@@ cks up these ideas to deliver these restri@@ ctions for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this doesn &apos;t mean po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other non@@ sense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , ma@@ pping one is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to be contribu@@ ted to this area as well .
but these are all the streets in the u.@@ s@@ .@@ a .
over@@ wh@@ el@@ med at the top of nasa &apos;s resol@@ ution view .
let &apos;s pull out a little bit now .
now this is even live on the internet . you can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te it .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really conne@@ cts together two different technologies .
the one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which von no@@ ah lo@@ om , a university student in washington , under the coun@@ sel@@ ing of steve sil@@ ks at the u@@ v .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i was done by microsoft &apos;s research . it was a very good collaboration .
so , this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
and you can see this when we create these kinds of vie@@ ws where we can break through images and make this experience of multiple kinds of resol@@ ution .
but the spa@@ tial obje@@ ction of the images is , in fact , important .
the computer visi@@ on algorith@@ ms had these images together , so they decided to be the real space where these images that are all made near gr@@ ass pi@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an pen@@ ms in the can@@ adi@@ an pen@@ ms , and they &apos;re here elements of soli@@ d di@@ as or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things all have been in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve had time to show you other environments .
there are ones that are much more spa@@ tial .
i &apos;d like to just take one of the original data sets of no@@ ah , and this is from a early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we &apos;ve been working in the summer for the first time in the summer to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch@@ line behind this technology , photo@@ syn@@ thetic technology , and this is not necessarily as obvious as we look at the environments we have on the website .
we had to worry about law@@ yers and so on as well .
this is a ca@@ the@@ d@@ al not@@ re re@@ constru@@ ction , which inci@@ dent@@ ally did in the computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r , and just sum@@ mar@@ ed not@@ re d@@ ame in fli@@ ck@@ r , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-@@ shir@@ ts and in the university of the university , etc . each of those or@@ mal ke@@ ars represents a picture that had been discovered as to this model .
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ s-@@ images images , and they &apos;re all in place in this way related to each other .
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
you know , i never have never thought that i &apos;m going to work on microsoft .
and i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for the re@@ ception here .
and i sus@@ pe@@ ct you can see that there are many different kinds of c@@ ameras : everything by the mobile camera to a professional sl@@ est , a fairly large number of them that have been put together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the stran@@ gers .
a lot of them are fac@@ ed and so forth .
so somewhere there are a number of photographs -- there they are .
this is actually a poster of not@@ re d@@ ame , who was recor@@ ding cor@@ rec@@ tly .
we can navi@@ gate from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can make things with social environments , and it &apos;s all colle@@ cted data from all of them -- from the collective memory of how , visu@@ ally the earth looks -- and everything is associated with each other .
all these photographs are connected to each other , and it creates something larger than the sum of parts .
they recei@@ ve a model that gener@@ ates from all over the earth .
consider this as the sequ@@ el of the work of ste@@ phen law@@ l@@ ger at the virtual earth .
and this is something that is using complexity that people use it , and they use their use for users to become bigger and bigger .
your own photos are color@@ ed with meta@@ data , which has given a different person .
if someone has gotten the trouble , and all of these sac@@ red sac@@ ks , and share who they are , then my photo is going to be raised by the not@@ re dam of sugar ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral all of a sudden , and i can start to use it as a sequence to enter in this room , into these meta@@ ver@@ ver@@ uses , the photos of other people , and to become a kind of cros@@ s-@@ based model of digital experience with the use of other families .
and of course , the product of the product are all of these vast virtual virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , which are not just through either over@@ hau@@ cy or satelli@@ te images and so forth , but by collective memory .
thanks very much .
do i understand it right ? your software en@@ ab@@ led that at some point , within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world are basically being connected to each other ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t do anything else than disco@@ vers .
and if you want to build them hyper@@ links between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting , if you think about the loss of se@@ man@@ tic information , which is a lot of these images .
as you take a web search for images , where you inclu@@ de sent@@ ences , and the text of the site con@@ tains a lot of information on what &apos;s image .
but what about if the image continu@@ es it with all of its images ?
and then the range of se@@ man@@ tic performance and the l@@ ength that comes out of that is really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c exchange effect .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . he@@ ye@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ fortun@@ e .
thank you very much indeed .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book that i hope you &apos;ve heard about other things , which you &apos;ve heard already , and i &apos;m going to try to make myself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i &apos;d like to start with what i call &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
and the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the offi@@ cial belie@@ fs of all western industri@@ alized societies .
the way the deci@@ ci@@ al do@@ g@@ ma works is , if our goal is ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the public good of our citizens , this is particularly central by ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the freedom of the individual .
and the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaning@@ ful , an un@@ avo@@ ir@@ able assu@@ mption for human beings .
when people have freedom , every one of us is for themselves to do the things that our public may ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze , and no one has to decide for us .
to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is a choice to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common ones they have .
this is , i think , such deep in our water supply , that it doesn &apos;t matter in the mind , it would be challen@@ ging .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you a couple of examples of what we need to do with modern progress .
this is my super@@ market . it &apos;s not a big thing .
i &apos;m just going to talk a little bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
there are 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you &apos;re not coun@@ ting the 10@@ -@@ variety ge@@ tab@@ oli@@ le , and 12 bal@@ pl@@ i@@ o essi@@ g that you could buy to make a large number of your sal@@ age of des@@ s@@ ession in the un@@ likely case , in the un@@ likely case , that none of the 17@@ 5 in the store is for you .
so , this is what the super@@ market is .
and then they go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics to put a stere@@ o plant -- go@@ er , c@@ d player , a ta@@ pe player , radio , am@@ pli@@ ble player . and in this one electr@@ on@@ ics , there are so many stere@@ os of stere@@ o .
we can assem@@ ble 6@@ .@@ 5 million different nan@@ o treat@@ ments from the components that are off@@ ered in this one business .
you have to ad@@ mit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communic@@ ations .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have every phone provi@@ der that you wanted to , as long as it came from m@@ opp@@ ing bell .
they r@@ ented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one ep@@ iso@@ de of that was that the phone never had broken .
these days , they &apos;re over .
we &apos;ve got almost an infin@@ ite choice of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is this in the middle -- an@@ 3 par@@ ent@@ - , nas@@ -@@ ha@@ ar tri@@ ssi@@ c@@ ene and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ ush l@@ é@@ e fac@@ kel .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that yet in your business , you can be sure that you will soon be able to get it straight .
and what it does is it conne@@ cts people to walk into the business and ask this question .
now , do you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is , &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do much too much .
in other aspe@@ cts of life , which are much more significant than the pur@@ ch@@ ase of objects , the same explosion of choice , the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a job , or we could do b .
a has these advan@@ tages and p@@ lot .
b has these advan@@ tages and p@@ lot . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what are i going to do ? &quot;
and the doctor says a has these advan@@ tages and the risks and the b has these benefits and the risks .
what do they want to do ?
and if they say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor is saying , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift of the bur@@ den of responsibility for the meeting of someone who knows something -- nam@@ ely the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing , and most likely , and therefore not in the best const@@ it@@ ution is a decision -- and therefore , not in the best const@@ it@@ ution is a decision -- nam@@
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs for people like you and me , and that , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why are they going to win around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is that you would expect the doctor to call us the next morning and requ@@ est a change of pres@@ cri@@ ption .
something so profound as our identity is now a matter of choice to show how this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t recei@@ ve identity ; we inv@@ ent it .
and we inv@@ ent that often as often as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everybody had one and they married them as quickly as they could , and then kids got as fast as they could , and then they had so fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , not when , and not what they were doing .
no@@ wa@@ days , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less care@@ ful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re working with other things , they ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i be married now ? &quot;
should i get married later ? should i have kids , or do i get a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all invi@@ ta@@ tional questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions to whether this means all the tas@@ ks that i in@@ dul@@ late to you and don &apos;t get a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed by how car@@ l has suggest@@ ed , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute from every single place on the planet -- except for the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
there are , by the way , a corner i &apos;m going to tell you about that i &apos;m not going to tell you about the val@@ el@@ ess@@ y .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that we have this incredible freedom of the choice we have in terms of doing work , again , again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids in foot@@ ball , and we have our cell phone on a hi@@ p , and we have our black@@ ber@@ ry on the other hum@@ p , and our laptop may probably be on our la@@ p .
and even if you &apos;ve gone all the way , every single minute in which we ask our child at the mu@@ ti@@ le of a foot@@ ball game , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i answer this email ? why should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the foot@@ ball game very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look at big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world that we lived in had looked like this .
and i want to say that there were some choices , but not all of it was a matter of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re living in now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
and all those choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a impli@@ cation , parado@@ x@@ er , is that it &apos;s more than free to free .
with so many op@@ tions that you can choose from , people are very hard to decide at all .
so i &apos;m going to give you another dra@@ sti@@ cal example of intro@@ duc@@ ing a study about invest@@ ing in volunte@@ ware ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation .
a collea@@ gue of mine in my career had access to investment by van@@ gu@@ ard , the giant gro@@ unded society of about a million collabor@@ ators and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10@@ -@@ investment fund that was the emplo@@ yer provi@@ ded , the participa@@ tion rate by two percent .
they offer 50 investment fund -- 10 percent fewer employees less than if they &apos;re only going to offer 5 . why ?
because there are 50 conver@@ sa@@ tions that are choo@@ sing to choose , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to choose to m@@ ess it up tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and , of course , never come .
now understand that this is not just true that people have to eat dog food when they &apos;re in reti@@ re@@ ment , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions so hard that they miss great investment supp@@ lies of their emplo@@ yers .
due to participa@@ tion , they give up to 5@@ 0,000 dollars a year from the work@@ spring , who was happy to re@@ produce their contribu@@ tions .
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of a lot of choices .
and i think it &apos;s appropriate to think that the world looks like this .
they really want to meet the decision , if it &apos;s for all the e@@ ter@@ u@@ ties , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or even the fal@@ se sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even when we reach out the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end up getting less satis@@ fied with the out@@ come of choice , than if we had the opportunity to decide where there was less opportunity to decide .
and there are several reasons to do this .
one of them is an integra@@ tion of the vast pl@@ at@@ ton rou@@ te , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ re is doing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this ima@@ ging alternative leads you to re@@ gre@@ t the decision , and that ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ates seem negative on the satis@@ fac@@ tion that you gave from your choice , even if it was a good decision .
the more possibility there is , the simpl@@ er thing , the simpl@@ er thing , is that it &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ led for the choices that you meet .
secon@@ dly , what econom@@ ists op@@ per@@ on op@@ per@@ on cost .
dan gil@@ bert made a great point of this morning by telling how much the way we ac@@ qui@@ red things depen@@ ding on what we compare .
well , if there are many alterna@@ tives to think about , it &apos;s just attra@@ ctive properties of alterna@@ tives that ex@@ clu@@ de them , that makes them less satis@@ fied with the alterna@@ tives that they &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
let me show you an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought about .
here &apos;s a pair of the ham@@ p@@ ton .
very expensive hous@@ ing .
beautiful after@@ noon . great day . you &apos;ve got it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; dam@@ n &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
everybody in my color@@ er neighborhood is gone .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he promis@@ es two weeks from the thought that he left the opportunity to have a great par@@ king place over day , a great par@@ king space .
now , op@@ per@@ asi@@ city costs us the satis@@ fac@@ tion that we recei@@ ve through our choice , even if we &apos;ve cho@@ sen that we have a fantastic
and the more possibility there is to sele@@ ction , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of these sele@@ ction in the op@@ per@@ on cost .
let me show you another example .
now , this carto@@ on is doing some ex@@ clu@@ sions .
he makes a stat@@ ement about it now , and maybe things are starting to do things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is always who you decide for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things may have a lot of attra@@ ctive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do .
thir@@ dly , es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
this is what stru@@ ck me when i was going to exchange my je@@ ans .
i &apos;m wearing je@@ ans , almost all of the time .
and there was a time when there was only je@@ ans of a species , and they bought it , and they fell missing bad , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if they &apos;d pay them long enough , they &apos;d be incredibly un@@ comfortable , they &apos;d start feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
so , in order to buy new je@@ ans for many years of training , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple je@@ ans , here is my size . &quot;
and the s@@ eller was like , &quot; do you want a ham , easy or wide ? &quot;
do you want to was@@ h butt@@ ons or anno@@ y@@ bac@@ ks ? st@@ ones or ac@@ id ?
do you want to bor@@ row je@@ ans ?
do you want to cut far very far , coffee , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h , &quot; and so on . &quot; and so on .
and my ja@@ w was down , and after i said , i &apos;d like to say , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the species that once was the only way that i had . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour to try and try and try all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and miss the business -- and i &apos;ll say the truth -- the best pas@@ sen@@ ding je@@ ans i &apos;ve ever had .
i liked it better . all those choices allowed me to do it better .
but i felt a bad feeling .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
and the reason that i felt bad was with all these available possibilities , my expec@@ tations of what je@@ ans would do for a good couple je@@ ans , went up .
i had very low expec@@ tations . i didn &apos;t have any con@@ cre@@ te expec@@ tations than they had just kind of had a kind of thing .
when she came into 100 species , one of them would have to be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so what i &apos;d come up with was what i expected , and what i had was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ led in compar@@ ison with what i expected .
the addi@@ ction of the possibilities in people &apos;s lives inevi@@ t@@ ably incre@@ ases the expec@@ tations of how good those kinds of possibilities are going to be
and that leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the marketing of marketing knows this , because if you would , because , if you will , don &apos;t know what it is about .
and the truth is more like this .
and the reason is , it wasn &apos;t anything better than anything that was worse than everything was worse than it was possible for people to do experience that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
no@@ wa@@ days in the world that we live in -- we have weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , perfe@@ ction as an expec@@ tation -- the best for which you will ever hope , things are as good as you &apos;re supposed to .
they &apos;re never pleas@@ ant to surprise , because their expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , are hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all come up with -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
i want to say -- a quick car moment -- which i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i didn &apos;t have to do better than that . i didn &apos;t dec@@ miss .
but leave it is not always a bad thing to leave .
finally , a con@@ sequence of the pur@@ ch@@ ase of a bad end of je@@ ans when there &apos;s only one way to buy is that if you &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who is responsible , the answer is that the world is responsible . what would you have done ?
when hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and you buy one that &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ful , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it is it .
they could have done better than that .
there &apos;s no exc@@ use for 100 different kinds of je@@ ans , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted to themselves to com@@ mit themselves .
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only one , but a profound ad@@ vo@@ cate to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide is that people have learned the dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment , because their standards are so high , because they have to explain these experiences themselves , and then , if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think it would be their fau@@ lt .
and so the ima@@ gery is that it &apos;s generally better , it &apos;s generally better , and we feel bad .
so let me rec@@ all you .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , which is one that we all think about right now , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there is no question that &apos;s better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than something , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than something .
there is a ma@@ gical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve mis@@ sed this point for a long time to improve our collective value .
now , as a matter of the question -- i &apos;m nearly done -- as a matter of the question , which is to think about what all these choices are in the industri@@ alized societies , is the material of wealth .
there are a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problems are not that big choice .
your problem is they &apos;ve got too little .
so , the things that i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating and fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing : steve le@@ vi@@ tt has told you about how this expensive and difficult to inst@@ all@@ ing the car se@@ ats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m going to tell you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they even hur@@ e .
it &apos;s wor@@ rying of what we &apos;re going to stand up with
if something of our society provi@@ ds so capable of making decisions of our society into which people would have too little choice , not just the lives of the people impro@@ ve , but our dig@@ ni@@ ty will be impro@@ ved .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ vement .
there will be income ad@@ v@@ ance to make it all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big sele@@ ction gives us one .
finally , read this carto@@ on , and , you know , a lo@@ vely person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , there &apos;s nothing in this glamour fish glass . &quot;
terri@@ fying imagination , a temporary view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i &apos;ve read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got to the point where the fish was a little bit familiar .
because the truth is that when you break the gold fish glass so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . they have paraly@@ sis .
when you break the gold fish glass , so everything is possible , it gives you satis@@ fac@@ tion .
she &apos;s growing up the paraly@@ sis , and he gets satis@@ fac@@ tion .
everybody needs a gold fish glass .
this is almost limited to limited security -- poten@@ tially for the fish , definitely for us .
but it &apos;s an abstra@@ ction by an abstra@@ ct gold@@ fish glass glass , which is a reci@@ pe for ad@@ ding , and , i sus@@ pe@@ ct disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we are di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new life and build .
we &apos;ve always been trying to ask some important questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think a lot of bi@@ ologists trying to understand , and that &apos;s based on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approach@@ es to simpli@@ fy it to the hyper@@ -@@ level components .
we actually di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed nearly 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , the shift of the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can re@@ generate life , or whether we can create new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gei@@ tal@@ ari@@ a , which is the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do it with a larger genome .
we &apos;ve made it up to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , which is very simple , compared to us . trust me , this is simple . but if we look at all of those genes that we can elimin@@ ate one after the other , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that this is the only way to syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some , actually , to syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some , which allows us to vari@@ ate the individual components , and then ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to ask ourselves the question , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
does it en@@ ables the chemistry to create these really big molecules , which had never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromo@@ some ?
an chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of infe@@ cted chemical material .
our steps at the dep@@ sions of life were exponenti@@ al .
now , our ability to write genetic code has been evol@@ ving very slowly , but yet our final point would be exp@@ and@@ ed , and our final point would now be on a exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
we &apos;ve started 15 years ago .
it actually took a couple of years ago with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we were doing the first experiments .
as it turns out , dna syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zes is extremely difficult .
there are tens of thousands of cells around the world that can make these little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a re@@ gener@@ ative process , so the longer you &apos;re going to do a piece , the more mistakes will happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put these little pieces together , and we could cor@@ rect the er@@ r@@ ation .
this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information , the genome of ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria killing it .
we made small pieces , we made a mis@@ er@@ y cor@@ rec@@ tion , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting period came when we took this piece of infe@@ cted chemical chemistry and gave it into a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made vi@@ ral particles .
and the vir@@ al particles were rele@@ ased by the cells , and they came back and killed e@@ . col@@ i .
and recently , i spoke with the oil industry , and they said that they were going to have this model .
they laugh@@ er more than you &apos;re doing it .
and so we think that this is a situation in the software , actually , in the software , can build your hard@@ ware in a
but we wanted a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some . it has more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters genetic code , and so we thought , we &apos;re building it in ta@@ pe from the size of the virus , which we could vari@@ ate the size of the ta@@ pe to understand what the individual compon@@ ent of a living cell is .
design is the key , and if you start to start digital with digital information at the computer , this digital information has to be really mis@@ er@@ able .
and when we first sequen@@ ced that genome in 199@@ 5 , the mis@@ er@@ er rate was a $ 10,000 of element@@ ary pa@@ irs .
we found 30 er@@ r@@ ors , and if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go out .
part of the design is to make pieces of pieces that are 50 letters long , that have to over@@ lay with other 5@@ 0-@@ letter st@@ ages , to build smaller sub-@@ un@@ its to make smaller sub-@@ un@@ its .
we &apos;ve built unique elements in here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve put some water@@ sig@@ ns into it .
just think about it : we have a four@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
tri@@ ll@@ ens of these letters -- these letters co@@ ves about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there &apos;s a single gap for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , words , thoughts .
ini@@ tially , we just sig@@ ned out .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
we engine@@ ered the pieces so that we could just reduce them with enzy@@ mes , and there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair these together and then we put them together .
and we &apos;ve been starting to create pieces , starting with st@@ ages of five to seven thousand letters , put them together together to make 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter components to bring them back together , up to 7@@ 2,000 .
in each step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces of information in a way that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process , what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve been trying to get to the point of the auto@@ ma@@ tion .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball plac@@ yo@@ ff .
if we get to these really big st@@ ages -- over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- then they won &apos;t be just growing in e@@ . col@@ i . it &apos;s over@@ lin@@ ing all the opportunities of modern molecular biology , and so we put together other mechanis@@ ms of the modern mechanis@@ ms
we knew about a mechan@@ ism of the hom@@ on@@ ist re@@ combin@@ ation , which is used biology to re@@ pair dna , which can bring together these pieces .
here &apos;s an example . there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans of the three million whe@@ els of radiation .
you can see in the upp@@ er field that its chromo@@ some just falls apart .
tw@@ ent@@ y to 24 hours later , everything has been put together in the same way that it was .
we &apos;ve got thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely wi@@ ped , they can even live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
i &apos;m absolutely certain that life can exist in space and move out , looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there is a lot of it out there .
so here &apos;s a sen@@ sation of the molecule that we &apos;ve produced by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used he@@ tern@@ al mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces , we &apos;ve ad@@ ded it , and ye@@ ast provi@@ des them auto@@ matically .
this is not a scan@@ ning electr@@ on screen , it &apos;s a regular microscop@@ e shot .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscop@@ e .
this is about six seconds of age over a period of six
this is the journ@@ ation we &apos;ve just comple@@ ted recently .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure that has ever been created by people .
it &apos;s got a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we could print it up at a level level of 10 and without any restri@@ ction , it would take 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start an chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s as easy when you put it in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ites like we are doing , you just take the nu@@ cle@@ us out there and you give another one in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the c@@ lon@@ es .
at arch@@ a@@ e@@ bacteria , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but it &apos;s only recently that we &apos;ve shown that you can transp@@ l@@ ant a whole chromo@@ some transp@@ l@@ ant from a factor of chromo@@ som@@ es from one cell to another and it can activ@@ ate those .
we fle@@ w the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ species . we said , well , these two lines , like humans and mi@@ ce , we &apos;ve got some extra genes so that we could choose this chromo@@ some . we put it in enzy@@ mes to destro@@ y all of the proteins , and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to value our very exten@@ ded graph@@ s here .
and the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring the process further .
so this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have a two-@@ chromo@@ some sam@@ ple , or a third of any individual , every time , every time , every single one , thousands of tra@@ its in just one second .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that has changed in a lot of time has been missing a lot of the biology .
there are enzy@@ mes called restri@@ c@@ tion@@ -@@ restri@@ tional enzy@@ mes that actually ta@@ pe dna .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell is not one ; the chromo@@ som@@ es that we used to add up .
and it was fra@@ med in the cell , and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as an alien material , and so we ended up having only one cell with a new chromo@@ -@@ chromo@@ page .
it was color@@ ed blue because of the genes that we used to em@@ body .
and after a very short period of time , it lost all the characteri@@ stics of the species , and conver@@ ted completely into a new species on the new software that we gave up to the cell .
all the proteins changed the mem@@ bran@@ es -- when we las@@ ed the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve trans@@ formed .
it may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ ch@@ is , but we can , by the way , by shif@@ ting the software dna , things quite dra@@ matically .
now , i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that this is not the gen@@ es@@ is -- this is based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution evolution .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we may be able to create a new form of the cam@@ brian explosion in which there may be massive new education based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s kind of obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;ve grown up from six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
and to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
today , three people on this planet are going to be on the planet for everybody who has exi@@ sted in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , it &apos;ll be
we &apos;ve got problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to challenge a challenge to offer it for 9 .
we need over five billion tons of carbon , 3@@ 0-@@ plus billions of ves@@ sel@@ s . it &apos;s a hundred million fe@@ atures per day .
when we think about biological processes , or some process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
and then of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 coming out of this material that &apos;s going on in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our disco@@ ver@@ ies from all over the world , a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i &apos;d like to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electr@@ on@@ y industry had a do@@ zen compon@@ ent , and look at the diversity of it .
we are here pri@@ mar@@ ily about the limit@@ ations of biological reality , and in the pres@@ ence of our imagination .
we have a technology today , because of these rapi@@ dly syn@@ thes@@ i@@ tics , to do what we are doing combin@@ or@@ ous gene@@ tics .
now we have the opportunity to build a huge robot that can make millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes , or to optimi@@ ze these processes , to make oc@@ tan@@ tan , or drugs of new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can change more molecular biology with the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just a bit of sele@@ ction . we can sele@@ ct for life ability , production of chemicals or fuel production v@@ acc@@ ine production and so on .
this is a picture of real design software that we &apos;re working with , which is to actually sit up and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like . we know exactly what its genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re now foc@@ using on the fourth generation of the generation .
you &apos;ve seen ma@@ ize to eth@@ an@@ ol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have two-@@ generation pollu@@ tan@@ ts of two-@@ generation and third generation that are going to be much higher sugar , like oc@@ tan@@ tan@@ tan or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but , as we think , the only way that we think that the only way in terms of biology is a big impact without a greater amount of food , or the limit@@ ation of its avail@@ ability , is when we see co2 as a field of material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are going to go this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first one with the green@@ gens of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sun@@ light and co2 are a method .
and in our disco@@ v@@ ements of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organis@@ m that we &apos;ve described in 199@@ 6 .
it lives in the deep@@ -@@ sea , about one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half miles deep , with almost co@@ ving water temper@@ atures .
it &apos;s turning co2 dio@@ xide in me@@ than@@ e using hydro@@ gen as energy source .
we &apos;re going to study whether we can use pollu@@ ted co2 , which could easily be used to produce produ@@ c@@ tion@@ -@@ based consumption , including this process in fuel to drive this process .
in a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- modern goals like the re@@ plac@@ ement of the entire pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry -- exactly . if you couldn &apos;t do it at ted , where otherwise ? the main source of energy is to become the energy
but in the same way , we &apos;re working on the process of impro@@ ving vac@@ cin@@ es for impro@@ ving v@@ acc@@ ine .
you &apos;ve seen it with flu this year , we &apos;re always a year back , and we &apos;ve got a dollar too little when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
i think that this can be changed by building re@@ combin@@ ative vac@@ cin@@ es in ad@@ oles@@ cents .
this is how the future may seem to look at changes , today , the evolutionary tree is acceler@@ ated with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ es , and maybe eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ites .
we have a light of light away from it , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to survive , to do that . thank you very much
on the last ted conference , i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i promis@@ ed back to explain how the machine works , and i promis@@ ed you how
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of those who didn &apos;t exist at the time , the l@@ h@@ c is the biggest scientific experiment that was ever introduced -- 27 miles in diam@@ e@@ ter .
and his job is to create the conditions which are less than a billi@@ on-@@ second after beginning in the universe -- and that up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly ambi@@ tious .
this is the machine by the outside of gen@@ ev@@ a .
we &apos;re going to take images of these mini@@ -@@ si@@ zed bag@@ s in dete@@ c@@ tors .
this is what i &apos;m working on . he &apos;s called at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 1@@ 6@@ 4 feet in diam@@ e@@ ter , 22 feet in diam@@ e@@ ter .
this is a spec@@ tac@@ ular picture of the at@@ las in the construction so that you see the scale of scale .
and on september 10@@ th , the machine was going on for the first time .
and this picture was recor@@ ded by at@@ las .
it gener@@ ated im@@ men@@ se ju@@ g@@ ks in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radiation partic@@ le that went back all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , and then finally , with one part of the l@@ h@@ c colli@@ ded in order to put a rain out of particles on the dete@@ ctor .
in other words , when we saw this image on the 10@@ th of september , we knew that the machine works , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph .
i don &apos;t know whether this was the biggest je@@ y , or this one , as someone went to the google side , and found the shot of it .
it means that we &apos;ve reach@@ ed a cultural impact next to the scientific level .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had been doing with these wir@@ ites here -- these golden dra@@ et@@ ings here .
these wir@@ es use 13@@ -@@ thou@@ ght-@@ thousand ta@@ stes when it comes to high-@@ performance performance .
well , the engineers , among you , are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t do it . these are little wir@@ es . &quot;
they can do this because , if you swe@@ pt them very far , they become called su@@ pr@@ ani@@ ck@@ ard .
so at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , hot@@ ter than the space between the stars , these wir@@ es can cause the ten@@ sion .
in one of the connections between over nin@@ e-@@ thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory of a factory .
so the wir@@ es of low and 25@@ -@@ thou@@ ght-@@ thousand am@@ ners are suddenly electri@@ fied electrical resi@@ stance .
and this was the result .
now , all of this is more amazing if you imagine that the mag@@ net wei@@ gh@@ s over 20 tons , and it shif@@ ted at about 30 in@@ ches .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
and i had to re@@ move what we were doing .
we re@@ treated them . we re@@ com@@ men@@ ded them .
and they &apos;re all now back on her way .
by the end of mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be func@@ tion@@ able again .
we &apos;re going to turn it down , and we &apos;re going to collect the first data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and let our journey continue to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , these acci@@ dents , the debate , the value of science and engineering is about those limit@@ s . it &apos;s easy to re@@ mind it .
i think the fact that it is so hard , the fact that we hold beyond our limit@@ ations , we form the value of things like l@@ h@@ c .
i &apos;m going to leave my close words to a story@@ scientist . hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , esti@@ ber@@ ing the us@@ eless experiments of his teaching department , his writing was michael far@@ a@@ day , which is why , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the development of the human mind , than to assu@@ me that our scientific ideas are meaning@@ ful , that there is no myster@@ y in nature , that our tri@@ t are u@@ tter@@ ly se@@ arch@@ ed , and that there are no new worl@@ ds to be for@@ dered . &quot;
thanks very much .
i &apos;m a roman@@ cian .
writing text@@ books is my job , but it is , of course , more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , li@@ fel@@ ong love , and fascin@@ ation .
and i &apos;m not expe@@ cting that it will be transforma@@ tive .
but i think a funny little bit of a weird place in my life and my career has come to re@@ think me to completely re@@ think my relationship with this work .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called the henry , pra@@ y , love center -- that , in fact , decided to be different than all my previous books , for some reason , into the world , and a big me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , an international image thing .
the conclu@@ sion is that , no matter where i &apos;m going to be treated as though i am in the field .
seriously -- ex@@ ecu@@ ted !
for example , they get out to me all the way up to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you worry about that success ?
have you not afraid that you write your whole life and you &apos;ve never created a book that &apos;s interested in anybody in the world ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really coura@@ ge .
i mean , it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i first told me that i wanted to be a writer , that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of an@@ gry response , repres@@ ented by the same kind of an@@ gry response .
people said , &quot; you know , aren &apos;t you afraid of having never succe@@ e@@ ded ?
have you ever afraid that you &apos;re going to kill the hu@@ mili@@ ation of a dis@@ scri@@ b ?
have you not afraid that you &apos;re going to go to this game of your life , and you never get something out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a corner of war -- your mouth is filled with the bit@@ ter as@@ hes of the failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : yeah . the next answer to all these
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i &apos;ve always had that .
and i sc@@ ared a lot more things that no one would ever do .
how al@@ ga@@ e -- and other terri@@ fi@@ can@@ ce things .
but , when i &apos;m writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this , and i ask myself , why ?
is that a reas@@ on@@ able ?
is it logi@@ cal that it should be expected to be afraid of doing the work that he feels at the work that he felt ?
and what &apos;s wrong with the creative business that they &apos;re inse@@ cure , that they don &apos;t make us safe about the universal mental condition -- in a way that other professi@@ ons don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years , as a chem@@ ist , he asked if he was afraid to be chemi@@ ber .
with your chemical block@@ print , john -- how are you going to do it with it ?
and it just didn &apos;t matter , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chem@@ ist have not gotten the repu@@ tation of al@@ co@@ hol swe@@ en people over the cent@@ u@@ ries of al@@
we then seem writing this type of repu@@ ters , but not only the wri@@ ters , but the creative of all gen@@ r@@ es , seem to have this repu@@ tation , ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
all you have to do is to look at the wi@@ ter death numbers from really great minds alone from the 20th century , which young and often died from their hands .
and even those who don &apos;t actually ac@@ qui@@ re su@@ i@@ ci@@ d , they seemed to be gu@@ il@@ ted by their tal@@ ents .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er just said before his death in his last interview : bill each of my books has killed me a little bit .
an extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can do about your life work .
but we don &apos;t even slow down when we listen to somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this type of stat@@ ements for such a long time , and in a way , we &apos;ve got the idea that creativity and suffering are naturally com@@ promis@@ ed , that creativity and suffering are kind of wra@@ pped together , and art -- and art -- is always leading to the sou@@ ff -- always lead to the ba@@ tel@@ ar .
now , the question i want to ask you about today is : is this idea for you all right now ?
are you feeling comfortable about this ? because with only one in@@ ch seas@@ on -- i don &apos;t feel comfortable with this notion at all .
i think they &apos;re ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how she &apos;s going to take away into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we live our great creative effort .
and i know , definitely , that it is for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start , to start this dark path of mind -- especially in the context that i &apos;m going to find myself in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 working years in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m writing from now is that everything i &apos;m writing from the world as the work that came out of my last text@@ book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it right now , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s extremely likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jes@@ us , what kind of thought !
those are the kind of thoughts that can get to anybody to start drin@@ in 9 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d rather continue to do this work that i love .
and so the question is : how ?
and after a while of refle@@ ction , i seem to say that , to continue writing , i have to write some kind of pre@@ ce@@ ding psych@@ ological constru@@ ct .
i somehow have to find a way from now to a way of writing a safe distance between me and my very natural twi@@ pe about how the reaction is going to be on the writing .
while i was looking for models in the last year looking for models to do that , i also went to see other societies , and i tried to find other societies to see whether they might have better or more sensi@@ ble ideas than we could , how to help creative creative risks that are associated with creativity .
this is a search that led me to the old gre@@ e@@ ce country , and the old ro@@ me .
please follow me , because the circle is going to end up in the end .
but in the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce land and ro@@ me , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of a di@@ v@@ ine lack of spirit , which comes out of a dist@@ ant , un@@ known source to people -- un@@ intelli@@ gi@@ ble , un@@ known reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these go@@ v@@ ine di@@ als of the creativity of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
from soc@@ cr@@ ops , he was known to believe that he would have a dis@@ m@@ ust who was going away for him from far away .
the roman@@ thei@@ s had the same idea , these kinds of body lo@@ aper minds , a star@@ c@@ us region .
this is great . the roman@@ ler didn &apos;t really think that an geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine cre@@ ature that was believed that it lived in the walls of an artist -- something like do@@ bby , the house -- who came out and the artist at work somehow helped the artist , and he would create the out@@ come of work in some way .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there it is , there is the distance i &apos;ve been talking about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that you protect from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the ages was prote@@ cted by certain things , such as , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ c@@ m , right ?
if your work was brilliant you didn &apos;t want to look at everything for you , everyone knew that you had this body geni@@ us that helped you .
when your work fle@@ w -- not a hand@@ ful of your career , right ?
everybody knew your geni@@ us was a bit laugh@@ ing .
and so people in the west really thought about creativity for a really long time .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance changed and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s track the human individual at the center of the universe -- about all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there is no room for my@@ cal creatures , the comm@@ ings of the di@@ v@@ ine .
it is the beginning of the rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came entirely from its individual .
for the first time in history , people are going to hear a geni@@ us , or some artist , instead of saying he &apos;s got a geni@@ us .
i have to tell you , i think it was a big er@@ ror .
you know ? i think there &apos;s a fir@@ ing person that he thinks , he or she is like the ves@@ sel , like the pen and essen@@ ce and the source of all of the di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ known myster@@ y is a tiny bit too much responsibility to mur@@ der her to a fra@@ sh@@ er , human psy@@ che .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
and it dis@@ per@@ ses and re@@ f@@ use whole e@@ gos , and it creates all those un@@ achie@@ vable expec@@ tations to success .
i think that this success@@ le pressure pressure has dec@@ lin@@ ed our artists of the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s right , and i think it &apos;s true -- it &apos;s the question .
can we modi@@ fy it ?
perhaps a fourth understanding about the relationship between people and the myster@@ y of the crea@@ tives of creativity .
maybe not yet .
maybe we can &apos;t just elimin@@ ate the thought for 500 years of good human@@ ism in a two-@@ minute lec@@ ture .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would say really ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ated scientific dou@@ bt about the notion of -- in principle -- fe@@ males , people who are looking out and apply to their projects , and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question that i want to leave up is : why not ?
why not think this about this ?
because it makes as much sense as anything that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about to explain the absolutely crazy dis@@ ability of the creative process .
a process , which is -- as everyone knows that they &apos;ve ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- they don &apos;t always experience reas@@ on@@ ably .
in fact , sometimes he can feel a par@@ an@@ or@@ -@@ cent@@ ric .
i had one such en@@ counter when i met the extraordinary american po@@ et r@@ ant@@ stone , who was now about 90 , but she was a sl@@ unter in her life , and she told me she was growing up in the field of virg@@ ini@@ a , she said she was growing up in the field , she said she would feel and hear like a po@@ em about the landscape .
she said it would be like a ch@@ ie@@ f train out of air .
she would roll up over the country .
she felt when it came , because it was going to put the earth out under her feet .
she knew she was going to do one such moment just one moment , and that was -- in her words -- land race like the de@@ vil .
she ran like the de@@ vil to the house as she was pur@@ su@@ ed by this po@@ em , and it was only about she had to get a piece of paper and a pen , so she had to get it through a she@@ et of paper and a pen so she could take it through it , and she could regi@@ t it through the paper .
she was not fast enough , she was not fast enough , and she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the po@@ em roll@@ ed through her , and she would keep doing it . she would keep moving over land , and she would say , &quot; look at ground after another po@@ et search . &quot;
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget the part -- she said that there was moments in which they were almost for@@ bi@@ cking it .
so she runs the house , and he &apos;s looking for the paper , and the po@@ em goes through her , and she &apos;s just grab@@ bing a pen when she wal@@ ks through her , and she &apos;s -- she &apos;s like , she &apos;s like she &apos;s attac@@ king her game with her other hand and she &apos;s going to get it to buy it .
and she got the po@@ em on his tail , and she pulled it back into her body , and she took it back to the she@@ et of paper .
and the po@@ em , the po@@ em , came in and on the paper -- went on on paper -- but back@@ wards -- last word for the first word .
and when i heard that , i thought about mir@@ r@@ ors this -- this is exactly how my creative process is emerging , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
this is not my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel !
i &apos;m a mou@@ e . to work up to work at the same time , i have to stand up at the same time and swe@@ at , and i &apos;m really aw@@ k@@ ward , and i &apos;m really
but even in my mou@@ l@@ al art , i sometimes have this thing cr@@ our@@ ched .
and i sus@@ pe@@ ct a lot of you have done it too .
i even had work or ideas coming out of a source that i really couldn &apos;t be able to identify .
what is it for a thing ?
and how are we going to deal with this in relationship without losing our minds , but at the same time holding ourselves in the way that we live ?
and to me , the best number example for me is how to do this , the musi@@ cian tom was@@ its , and i had intervie@@ wed him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this top@@ ic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s em@@ em@@ ma@@ tion of the em@@ bed@@ ded modern artist who was trying to master these un@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that lived in him and interact with them .
but then he became older and quie@@ ter , he told me he was going to take one day on a stable street in los angeles , and that &apos;s where everything changed for him .
he dro@@ ve at a high speed when he suddenly sounds a little frag@@ ment of a mel@@ o@@ dy , which , as he often is , is often heavy for him , and he wants to have her . she &apos;s funny . he li@@ ves it , but he can &apos;t inclu@@ de it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe drawing drawing .
so , he begins to clim@@ b this old ta@@ pe into it , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to end up with this song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of pl@@ ani@@ st , he just stopped up .
he ended up all the time and he did something completely new .
he just looked down into hea@@ ven , and he said , &quot; you know , you can &apos;t see i drive a car ? &quot;
the thing i see like this is as if i just write up a song ?
if you really want to have exi@@ sting , come back to a che@@ ar@@ er moment , once i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , d@@ ing@@ le today , someone else .
go and face leon@@ ard co@@ hen . the axis .
his whole job process has changed .
not the work itself , and it was often as dark as marriage and everybody else .
but the process and the heavy ta@@ pe that surro@@ unded him , was nu@@ ged when he got the geni@@ us out , where he had no sugar and she left it back to where he had come out and left him back where he was going to be a more remote , ag@@ oni@@ zing thing .
it could be a hand@@ ful , mira@@ cul@@ ous , bizar@@ re collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stran@@ gen@@ ous thing , which was not quite tom .
now , when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked , and it also saved me .
i saved this idea when i was in the writing process of the u.k. meeting , pra@@ y , love . i fell into one of those cu@@ ts of the second , which we all fall when we work on something , and it didn &apos;t work . you know , you start thinking it &apos;s a disaster . it &apos;s going to be the worst book that &apos;s ever been written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just finish up the project .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed how tom had talked in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i gradu@@ ated from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt , and i was talking about my comm@@ ent@@ ary towards a blan@@ k corner of the space .
and i said , &quot; look , bill , you know , you and i know both , if this book is not a brilliant book , that it wasn &apos;t completely my fau@@ lt , right ?
because , you know , i &apos;m getting rid of everything i &apos;ve invest@@ ed . i don &apos;t have
so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to cross up here and hold your copy of it .
all right . but , if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then the he@@ ars with it .
i &apos;m still going to write further , because this is my job .
and i &apos;d like to leave you , to finish co@@ l , that i was here today for my personal jobs .
because -- at the end of it , it &apos;s like follo@@ ws . before cent@@ u@@ ries , in the desert of north africa , people gather@@ ed up to mon@@ ly dan@@ cers and music that have been cut for hours -- until the da@@ wn .
and those fun@@ ds were great , because the dan@@ cers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but again and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the per@@ form@@ ers actually became over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that all of you in your life have seen such a version of performance .
it was as if time st@@ ops , and the dan@@ cer went through a kind of a box . he didn &apos;t do anything else when he hadn &apos;t ever done it -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything was lin@@ ked together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to have a human@@ i@@ um .
it was stre@@ t@@ ched away from within and down from the bottom , and everything turned through through a di@@ v@@ ine fire .
when something happened then , people knew what it was . they called it on his name .
they put their hands together , and they started sing@@ ing : web al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god , god .
this is god , do you know ?
in fact , interesting histor@@ ical foot@@ note : when the mo@@ unt sou@@ sp@@ in was re@@ vie@@ wed , they brought that practice . the stat@@ y changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries of street al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h planes to tom@@ ol@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é square , which you &apos;re still hearing with cra@@ cks and fl@@ am@@ -@@ party dan@@ ces .
if a po@@ tor in spa@@ in in spa@@ in is something impossible , some ma@@ gical did : street al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo paint , there it is : an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ny look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tri@@ cky part follo@@ ws the next morning when the dan@@ cers beat up themselves , and reali@@ zing that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;@@ clock at a tu@@ es@@ day -- and he no longer car@@ ries a five-@@ hour of god .
it &apos;s just an aging mortality with pain@@ ing k@@ nee k@@ nee , and maybe it will never get up to those hei@@ ghts .
and maybe someone &apos;s going to call god name again when he &apos;s standing , but what &apos;s he going to start doing with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s heavy .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ rec@@ tions of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite as rich , if you didn &apos;t know at the beginning that the most important aspe@@ cts of your mind would be .
if you may only believe that you &apos;re a ligh@@ t@@ weight -- from an un@@ belie@@ vable resource for your life &apos;s time , which will be passed on to someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about this , all of this changes changes .
so i started thinking , and so sur@@ ely , i think , in the last few months , while i worked at the book , which is soon going to appear -- as the most dangerous , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , profound anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te of my recor@@ ding .
what i have to constantly say , when i &apos;m crazy about it , is not afraid .
it wasn &apos;t dis@@ rup@@ ted .
just just do your job .
it &apos;s still still for your contribu@@ tion , whatever he wants to do .
if your job is dan@@ cing , tan@@ te .
if the stupid di@@ v@@ ine geni@@ us that you put asi@@ de on the site , you decide , for a brief moment , a sound of wonder through your eff@@ or@@ ts , then the phan@@ ol@@ é ! the web
and if you don &apos;t , dance yet , dance .
and jen@@ ol@@ é ! space for yourself , despite all of that .
i think there and i have the feeling we need to teach .
henry ol@@ é ! space for yourself , just for all of this , just for being the m@@ ere human love and spirit to be there .
so thank you .
so thank you .
ol@@ k@@ é !
last year , i &apos;ve shown these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s , which for nearly three million years , had the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has been s@@ hr@@ in@@ k by 40 percent .
but it doesn &apos;t write much enough to explain the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thi@@ ck of the eg@@ gs .
in a sense , the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s , in a sense , is the world &apos;s bedro@@ cking heart of our global climate system .
it gro@@ ws in the winter , and it &apos;s s@@ hr@@ in@@ king in the summer .
i &apos;m going to show you the next slide that i &apos;m showing you about is a ti@@ mel@@ y-@@ lap@@ se view of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the rou@@ te of the ice is covered with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue , this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in the winter , and it &apos;s s@@ hr@@ in@@ king in the summer .
what &apos;s called the ab@@ sen@@ ce of ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here .
this is a problem , because the warming is the fro@@ zen reason of looking at the arc@@ tic ocean , where there are large quanti@@ ties of fro@@ zen carbon , which , if it comes up , is trans@@ mit@@ ted by micro@@ bes to me@@ than@@ e .
and compared to the entire amount of climate modi@@ ties in the atmosphere , this is going to double double when we cross this critical point .
already in some flat la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e , from the self , today , in the water of al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter at the university of al@@ as@@ ka is travel@@ ing with another she@@ ep of labor in the last winter of the winter .
who@@ a !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how is it going to happen to us .
and one reason is , this vast heat system war@@ n@@ ani@@ zing green@@ land from the north .
this is a year of a se@@ al of rain .
but the volu@@ me are signific@@ antly larger than ever before .
this is the swa@@ st@@ l@@ us@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west &apos;s green@@ land .
if you want to know what the ocean level is going through through land ice , you &apos;re going to fli@@ p it into the ocean .
these ri@@ vers take a lot of sight .
on the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest arc@@ tic mass on the planet .
the researchers last month announ@@ ced that the entire continent is now a negative ice print .
and west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which is up above a couple of under@@ water is@@ lands , is very strong in mel@@ d-@@ cutting .
this is equivalent to 20 feet of sea , such as green@@ land .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the thir@@ d-@@ largest ice mass , you can see above new la@@ kes , which were gl@@ aci@@ er a couple of years ago .
for@@ ty percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water out of this mel@@ d-@@ water .
in the event , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the fresh water source for this city .
and the water quanti@@ ties have exp@@ and@@ ed .
but when they collapse , most of the drin@@ king water will fall away .
in california , a 4@@ 0-@@ percent redu@@ ction of the s@@ er@@ ra rou@@ te was seen in the si@@ er@@ ra .
this is the store of the stor@@ m .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve been reading , are serious .
these emerging dri@@ ll@@ ing all over the world creates a dra@@ matic increase to fire .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers all over the world have never taken place in a really extraordinary and susta@@ ined amount of previ@@ ously .
four times so many over the last 30 years , like in the last 30 years .
this is a completely uns@@ ur@@ si@@ ble development pattern .
and if you look at this in the histor@@ ical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve got 70 million tons of co2 produ@@ ces every 24 hours -- 25 million tons per day per day into the ocean .
if you look at the area of eastern pacific , pre@@ cis@@ ely , from the american continent and both of those indian sub-@@ continent , where there is a dra@@ matic dec@@ line of the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , bes@@ i@@ des de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent , is the burning burning of fossil fu@@ els .
oil is a problem , and coal is the equivalent of biggest problem .
the united states is one of those two largest pollu@@ tan@@ ts , combin@@ ed with china .
and the sugge@@ sti@@ on was to build a lot more of carbon fac@@ tor@@ ies .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that have been cut over the last few years , with some of the green alterna@@ tives that have been pro@@ posed .
compassion is a political conc@@ ern in our country .
and the co@@ tat@@ -@@ u@@ ps and the o@@ ins of o@@ ver have spent a quar@@ ter billion dollars last cal@@ an year to measure clean coal , which is already a con@@ tradi@@ ction in itself .
this is a picture remin@@ ded me of something .
and about christ@@ mas in ten@@ mas , at home at home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion tons of co@@ hl@@ es@@ lam@@ m .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news , you know .
this is in our country of the second largest extin@@ ction of america .
this is what happened at christ@@ mas .
one of the pur@@ pos@@ es of co@@ tat@@ -@@ lap@@ se surgery was this .
fro@@ sty of the carbon man is a tou@@ ent , happy go@@ am .
it &apos;s got it in sk@@ ells and len@@ sion in america , and it helps it to grow our economy .
fro@@ sty , the carbon man is cle@@ aner every single day .
he &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and coura@@ ge@@ ous , and wor@@ ker , and workers , stay in love and bread
this is the source of most of the coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the most powerful min@@ er is the la@@ p of mas@@ sey meat .
let me just say one very clear : al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry ri@@ d , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alli@@ ance alli@@ ance for climate protection has come up with two char@@ ges .
this is one , a part of it .
at co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we see climate change as a serious dan@@ ger for our business .
and so we set it up to the top line , we spend a substan@@ tial amount of money to get an investment action on the road to get the truth about char@@ coal .
the fact is that coal is not a dir@@ ty .
we think she &apos;s clean -- and still sm@@ ells well well .
so don &apos;t make a worry about climate change .
let &apos;s get rid of it .
clean char@@ coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! that machine is pretty sound .
but it &apos;s the sound of cle@@ aner co@@ squ@@ ted technology .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main causes for global warming , the remark@@ ably clean co@@ squ@@ ted technology , which you see here , changes everything .
and if you look carefully , this is today , clean co@@ squ@@ ted technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security is .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thre@@ e@@ der that conne@@ cts these together is our depen@@ dence of carbon dio@@ xide as a dir@@ ty coal and out@@ wh@@ el@@ med oil .
but now there is a coura@@ ge@@ ous , new solution to liber@@ ate us out of this ab@@ und@@ ant .
support america with 100 percent clean clean electricity , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years ?
a plan to get america back to work , to make us sa@@ fer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is great enough to solve our problems .
ear@@ n america . find more out .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a new govern@@ ment@@ ation of america .
one of the most fa@@ st@@ est ways , our depen@@ dence of old , dir@@ ty fu@@ els , that thri@@ ves our world to reduce .
the future is here : wind , sun and a new energy system .
new invest@@ ments in order to create well-@@ paying jobs .
support america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african ada@@ ge : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone . &quot;
if you want to get far , go back together . &quot;
we have to get far away , and we have to get far .
thanks very much .
i &apos;d like to start asking you to think back to your childhood when you played with com@@ modi@@ ty games .
while they realized how to dist@@ ingu@@ ish the hands out and move out , they actually learned how to think and solve problems , and actually start to understand and understand problems through understanding and change ways .
the spa@@ tial thinking is ti@@ ghtly related to how we understand most of our surro@@ und@@ ings .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way we interact with real objects -- along with my exper@@ t , pat@@ ti , and my collea@@ gue je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i started to wonder : what if we used computers , instead of a map of a mouse , that moves like a digital finger@@ print on a bottle of a bottle of a hole -- what if we could interven@@ e with two hands and take data physi@@ cally , and how do we want to interven@@ e with two hands and how we might want to do it ?
and that question was so challen@@ ging that we had evolved and evolved the answer , and we &apos;d evolved more clo@@ sely .
in short , an el@@ der@@ ability is an inter@@ active computer in the size of a hum@@ cket .
you can move with your hand , you can percei@@ ve each other , you can pick up your mov@@ ements , and you have a screen and a radio wor@@ ker .
a lot more important , are physi@@ cally , so why you can only move them out like plan@@ t@@ ings of your hands , and move away from the hands .
and the se@@ a@@ ils are an example of a new generation of aid to manipu@@ lation of digital .
and when these devices are becoming more powerful , and they &apos;re developing a responsibility for their mo@@ tions , and recognize each other , and the ene@@ mi@@ ties of our surro@@ unds with them , then we can begin to begin with the study of new and frag@@ ment@@ al-@@ related interaction types .
i &apos;m going to start with a couple of simple examples .
this higher spirit is con@@ forming for the vide@@ o-@@ re@@ pur@@ ment , and if i &apos;m in a direction , the video is going to hit the video forward , and when i p@@ p it into the other direction , it &apos;s going back@@ wards .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its take away each other .
so if i put them next to each other , that &apos;s what she &apos;s going to do .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded in the face , you can notice that , and you can get something nervous .
and they also feel their mo@@ tions and the re@@ co@@ very .
one interesting conclu@@ sion of the inter@@ actions that we &apos;ve discovered is that we could use everyday gest@@ ures on data , such as color , how to wra@@ p things like this , how to do it with flu@@ ids .
in this case , we &apos;ve con@@ calcul@@ ated three degrees as a color garden , and i can use them to cast color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to be mix@@ ed .
if we push it off , we can cut a little back back .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or mus@@ cles , where we have people to give up the possibility of fast learning , and we want to see the results immediately .
this is me -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series , which i created with a simple theory of evolution .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mix@@ ture made of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
basically , any one of the steps that you have on every continu@@ ous random moment , and while you &apos;re trying to form words , these are going to be recor@@ ded over a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
and then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mix@@ ed again , and you have a new letter combin@@ ation and new possibilities .
thanks very much .
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i was able to move them up to try and find a video of it .
they really loved it .
one thing that &apos;s interesting about these kinds of appli@@ cations is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of in@@ struc@@ tions .
everything you &apos;ve got to say is &quot; tv words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
let me show you a couple of people who are testing it .
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest pla@@ te at the bottom right there .
and it turned out that he wanted to st@@ ack the se@@ es .
so for him , they were just dri@@ ll@@ ing .
this is a inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ quar@@ t .
we wanted to develop an edu@@ cational tool for language learning .
so this is fe@@ li@@ x .
he can bring new characters into the scene by hit@@ ting the higher spirit of the table , who shows this figure .
this is him holding the sun up here .
the sun wal@@ ks up .
now he &apos;s pul@@ ling a tra@@ ctor in the scene .
the or@@ an@@ stian tra@@ c@@ ator .
good work ! yes !
by sha@@ king the distance , and you put it asi@@ de , it can be inter@@ acting the characters ...
his own story inv@@ ents his own story .
hell@@ o !
it &apos;s a story with the open end , and it can decide how it &apos;s evol@@ ving .
flying c@@ at .
the last example that i &apos;ve been strug@@ gling to show this is a music sequen@@ cer sequen@@ cer that we &apos;ve developed recently , and we &apos;ve evolved in the lou@@ d@@ der as sound as a sound , like leadership speech , b@@ ass and pul@@ ch@@ y .
each has four different vari@@ ations ; you can sele@@ ct what you want to use .
and you can reduce these notes into the sequence that you can actually ac@@ qui@@ re in certain patterns .
and you store them by just holding a ton@@ gue higher to a sequence of sequen@@ cing .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and fil@@ ters .
you connect it with a particular note , and then you add it up to it .
and then more diver@@ gent effects like p@@ ace and volu@@ it that you use on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s take a look .
we &apos;re going to start by stor@@ ing the management voice in two programs , and put it in a row , and add them a little bit more of the voice .
now i &apos;m going to wra@@ p a b@@ ass .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit more of it .
and i &apos;m now going to wra@@ p the fil@@ ters with the fis@@ her@@ y , so i can sum@@ mit the effect of life .
i can acceler@@ ate the entire sequence by swi@@ mming the p@@ ace into one another or another .
and now i &apos;m going to wra@@ p the fil@@ ch@@ ass nor with the b@@ ass , for a little more expression .
i can change the sequence as it moves away .
and i don &apos;t have to plan them in front of me , but i can impro@@ v@@ ise , you can down@@ date or s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed it .
and finally , i can pin@@ ch the entire sequence by going to the left of the cra@@ p@@ -@@ scale distance to the left .
thanks very much .
so as you can see , my exc@@ it@@ ement is to develop new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are better to fit out how our brains and bodies work .
and i &apos;ve had time today to show you some part of this new design world and some of the possibility of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
so the idea that i want to leave you with is that we are at the th@@ res@@ hold to these new generation of volunte@@ ers to interact with digital media , to bring information into our world in our world , that inclu@@ des our dem@@ um@@ ges .
thanks very much .
i &apos;m pleas@@ ed to talk to you all about the conversation
yeah , good after@@ noon .
i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to be there .
yeah , so what &apos;s going to be bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
i just have to pull out a little bit , and bio@@ ha@@ cking is a little bit more of the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve only been working on the bio@@ ha@@ cking for a couple of years , and i &apos;ve started to realize that because i just wanted to know more , and it also wanted to do what i &apos;ve learned in studying theore@@ tical .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so , it was a curi@@ osity , and i wanted to sort of just sort of closer on the matter of matter , like this
i think that the molecular biology in general is generally present , so generally speaking , biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything you count , you know , syn@@ thetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , is extremely important , and much , much more important will be in the future .
there are such con@@ temporary things like these whole gene@@ tically engine@@ ered plants on the ver@@ ges .
there &apos;s now cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the u.@@ s@@ .@@ n. , trying to make bio@@ cape , so gas@@ ol@@ ine from al@@ ga@@ e .
there are also things that are completely in everyday life , which most people are not aware of , including was@@ hing enzy@@ mes , which allow us to was@@ h at 4@@ 4 degrees , are also gene@@ tically optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes .
and the list is increasingly continu@@ ed to continue .
and so , from the interest of this technology , i &apos;ve come up with this technology , i &apos;ve come up there .
now , why is it ha@@ ck@@ le ?
most people know that out of the software zone .
computer ha@@ cks , and then in the media , it always gets like this , is that the ha@@ ck@@ ers break in there and cla@@ ws data , and so on .
and that &apos;s kind of a sad thing to do for ha@@ ck@@ scene , because it doesn &apos;t matter what it actually was like , and what &apos;s going on .
and that is the software ha@@ cker , in the 197@@ 0s , in the &apos; 7@@ 0s , in the &apos; 7@@ 0s , and that &apos;s what the internet was doing as well .
and it &apos;s about working with a play@@ ful , creative , original way , to solve a problem .
and the problem , this is not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can just be a social problem , which is just a problem , so a random problem to throw up a question , and how do you do that , or how do you do it better .
and it turned out to be em@@ bed@@ ded with software , but there are also in electr@@ on@@ ics , there &apos;s a whole ba@@ te scene that &apos;s going on with electr@@ on@@ ics of electr@@ on@@ ics , and they &apos;re doing all kinds of things .
and now , just towards biology , and this is where biology comes from syn@@ thetic biology , is that biology is really a bit of information science , because , the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a code is an abstra@@ ct code , which is , yes , it &apos;s not exactly the same as computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just cy@@ ber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can tell you , you can also ha@@ ck it , like this , and i find that i find incredibly fascinating , and i wanted to go a lot deeper with it .
in fact , there was only two thousand eight really form , these are networks .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe , and with a co@@ operation in india , which is now members or active people all over the world .
this is a more more arti@@ stic ex@@ ecu@@ tion , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosop@@ her@@ s and philosop@@ her@@ s and working with scientists to exp@@ and with these technologies and ask questions and make it crea@@ tively , and there are museum exhi@@ bi@@ tions , and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s always about trying to find such a se@@ er access to this , to have a play@@ ful approach to it .
and then there are do@@ -@@ it@@ able bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g , d.@@ -@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o bi@@ o .
this is a network , which is a network , which is really more kind of for@@ um where you &apos;re talking about and you disc@@ uss online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and there &apos;s a little bit of business on the way , and there &apos;s a bit of a question as well as being used .
and from these networks that have the entire popular , which has the entire popular , it &apos;s kind of evolved , i &apos;d like to wra@@ p out .
what you see here in the front on the upp@@ er left , which is a ha@@ ck space , which is basically a kind of school , a private school , a non@@ profit community , where everybody can get there .
kids , old , all kinds of people go there to just get out of it , they &apos;ve set up a lab , and look at what you can do when these lab proto@@ col@@ s .
on the left left there is a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , home@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ art fi@@ sts , those , but they have quite a long time ago .
there are more than these other two networks .
and they also work in such an arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct with biological materials and , yes , electr@@ on@@ ics of electr@@ on@@ es , and combin@@ ing it in a rather dis@@ pu@@ te way .
a group of pun@@ ar@@ a that i learned earlier about a while ago , which is a student group that would pre@@ fer to con@@ front the public , what they &apos;re learning in school , and they &apos;ve come up with some kind of wheel@@ ful actions , and people are trying to explain what &apos;s going on .
and i have a lec@@ ture in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen on the local museum in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in the medical museum , using an exhi@@ bi@@ tion to the top@@ ic .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s a very young people , but the only thing that &apos;s really united ated is this fascin@@ ation in technology .
and what you can do with it , and also ask yourself to go to society and ask , like , ok , what do you want to participa@@ te , what do you want to participa@@ te in doing this with you ?
so , ok enough to ha@@ ck biology now , you have to kind of need material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you also need tools , and this is what a lab is then .
or , typically , what you &apos;re looking at in a lab , which is sort of ru@@ pped machines , extremely expensive machines , extremely diver@@ se , just for profession@@ al , trained acade@@ mi@@ sts with ph@@ ania , and so on .
and our approach was to say , ok , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because each coffee pan@@ ple has a lot of time , actually , a lot of lab technology than most lab devices , and it &apos;s like this .
and s with this pre@@ mis@@ e with this pre@@ mis@@ e , for example , has tried for example brian de@@ g@@ ger in england , trying to assem@@ ble a hyper@@ -@@ print ca@@ per , a he@@ ath , and , yes , that cycle of ta@@ pe , a he@@ ath and , yes , that cycle of ta@@ pe , and then it &apos;s growing bacteria .
so anybody who &apos;s been ch@@ ased once a sou@@ p that he left too long had already been done before .
and i tried this in my lab , and i tried to ex@@ tend a little bit like this , and then i bought such a close piece of hands on e@@ bay and a little bit of a bit of a analysis , trying to make a jo@@ int test , so that / d.@@ n@@ .@@ a finger prin@@ ting , it was kind of going to work home .
actually , that shouldn &apos;t be a jo@@ ke , but it shouldn &apos;t be .
on the bottom of this picture , you see the lab , in per@@ se@@ min@@ ation , so it &apos;s such an al@@ ig@@ ned garage , so it &apos;s such an al@@ ig@@ ned sound as well as anything that &apos;s been present , a group in paris , which gives me what it is , and it &apos;s pretty successful stuff , so i want to cut a project a little bit .
and this is bio@@ the@@ tics , which is also mentioned in ha@@ cker@@ space , which is this thing , kind of , sort of , sort of , molecular biology , basically for molecular biology .
and so , yes , you can see it &apos;s relatively , very well , so that &apos;s where it &apos;s all about people who are going to go to houses , up to big organizations , who are holding more form@@ ation already in institu@@ tion@@ alized form .
but it always always happens to be the approach that it should be easy and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , ok , there &apos;s real scen@@ es as well , and we &apos;re online , and we know so the people that always ch@@ ame and stuff .
and then from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ your@@ -@@ of-@@ date , we &apos;ve got to make real meetings , and then we organized two events , one in london , a two-@@ thousand , and shor@@ tly after@@ wards in the u.@@ s , in san francisco .
and , you know , it was kind of like , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to share , what do we want to share with ?
and what are our values , and what are our minds , our foundation ?
and what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve worked up with a co@@ st-@@ func@@ tion@@ -@@ wea@@ ving ct .
and it was quite intui@@ tive , so everyone has just kind of gotten his wi@@ sh@@ es , his and what &apos;s going on , and then they &apos;re sending it up , and then .
and there , in my opini@@ on , i think there was a very good code .
and we have this one , but this is , you know , i think this is a pretty good thing , and this is , i think , quite well , people are very conscious of this .
and we even tried to bring it back into the acade@@ mic world , but there &apos;s kind of no way it &apos;s done .
so , i think we &apos;re in the bio@@ ha@@ cker scene , in terms of it even a step further than the acade@@ mi@@ cal world .
now , what do we actually do for projects ?
one project that i did with the ha@@ ck@@ ben@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted to tin@@ k a so-@@ called op@@ tic tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory or op@@ tic p@@ is@@ ette .
this is , if you focus on a las@@ er be@@ am , on one in the room , you can catch little particles into the air or in the liquid of the liquid , and then you move in that focus , so it &apos;s kind of a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory , so it &apos;s kind of a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory of it , so it &apos;s basically like a tra@@ ctor be@@ am .
this really works , this is going to be in the acade@@ mic square , and we thought , well , k , we &apos;re going to get away , then we &apos;ve taken a web@@ c@@ am that wra@@ ps up the l@@ ens , turn the l@@ ens , then you have a microscop@@ e that &apos;s going to increase about four hundred times .
this is what you see down there .
and then we li@@ pped up a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d stran@@ ner , and we pulled the po@@ ll up the las@@ er , and then we tried to focus on this camera
and unfortunately , we &apos;ve learned that , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
so another project , which is out of the french group in paris , which has been done , which is pretty cool .
so , he &apos;s kind of like a brain wave device , so e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g or something like this , so he &apos;s working with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
and he tra@@ pped up this hel@@ m there , and in the co@@ operation with the museum , that &apos;s going on .
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors went in into the room , put it on this chair , put it up , put this hel@@ m .
and then their brain waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought they were thinking , and how they thought they were different lights in the room .
it was a pretty a@@ vid project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this sort of chair ste@@ t@@ ure story , is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , which is the poly@@ mer chain response , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about cop@@ ying genes , to repli@@ cate , to repli@@ cate , to stimu@@ late , to frag@@ ments , so that you can see it .
so , when i do this , the pro@@ fil@@ er in the field , then go , collect some hair sam@@ ples , and then they &apos;re doing some hair sam@@ ples , and then they &apos;re doing this method , and then they can say , o@@ .@@ k. , that hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this human being , like this .
and the machines that are doing this , they &apos;re pretty expensive so that you buy commer@@ cially , the che@@ ap@@ est ones go out at about four thousand euro@@ s .
and this is not at the ho@@ b@@ by@@ al area , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that &apos;s also able to do a lot .
so this is just one app@@ lic@@ ation of a lot of people you can do with it .
and they ran out there , and they said , o@@ .@@ k , we do it easier and che@@ aper , and then we have a source of open source , so open hard@@ ware , electr@@ on@@ ics , put these this device together , and now they &apos;ve brought it into the market , and now they &apos;ve got the most che@@ ap@@ est supply of these devices all over the world .
i think kind of like six dollars or something like this .
but in fact , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s certainly in a frame@@ work where it &apos;s really more vulnerable to it .
so , i think it &apos;s a very bro@@ a@@ der ha@@ ck , i think .
a project that i started doing was to build a gene class .
gene &apos;s elec@@ tor is , yes , like some kind of air prin@@ ting , which is about so far , two centi@@ meters or something .
you invi@@ te the n@@ .@@ a on gold@@ particles , and the gold@@ particles then put it into these air cap@@ su@@ les , and then i shot them up on the hall , and then i got the ligh@@ t@@ ings to light up with
so , the device you see there , it doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s kind of like my prototyp@@ e , but it &apos;s kind of po@@ pped up like this , the thing that goes on , electr@@ on@@ ics came up and pressure , and it was too high , and it was too high , the thing went up .
and then i took a be@@ a@@ ther and i jo@@ ined it on it .
a da@@ ir@@ er , if you make the full power with water , you have enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s about four to six times a time .
and then you can acceler@@ ate the particles down enough enough , and then they go in the hall .
and the commercial device costs about $ 1.@@ a thousand thousand euro@@ s or something called the fif@@ ths of the 50 .
so , it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically accep@@ table .
so that &apos;s the moment , right now , is the symbol of the scene of the scene to increase this avail@@ ability of technology , and also increase the information and wisdom that more people can be enga@@ ged with .
because , as it said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have very little sense of it , nei@@ ther of them , also , to form very well .
because , if you &apos;re just reading about it from se@@ er-@@ day liter@@ ature , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve done it or you &apos;ve seen it yourself .
and i think technology is going to be more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to present as an in@@ formed citi@@ zen@@ ent in society , and you want to talk to you , you need access to knowledge and technology , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it , and understand it .
and that &apos;s what makes it open under the ta@@ x of open space and citi@@ zen science .
so , as you get into the situation as a citi@@ zen , you &apos;re going to be able to ex@@ clu@@ de with these scientific technologies .
and this is the nu@@ cle@@ us of the nu@@ ts of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
these are the people who are off@@ ering offi@@ cially on the website , like the i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bio@@ -@@ bio@@ -@@ -@@ or@@ g tree .
now , this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting about it is that they &apos;re also introduced in sou@@ the@@ ast asia as well .
i think that &apos;s there , i think , there are fewer people in there than actually exi@@ sting .
so i know some people who didn &apos;t kill themselves .
and these are just now the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , the individual people .
so in part , with these ha@@ ck@@ ers , they &apos;ve come together with these places .
and this is all in the beginning .
as i said , two-@@ 0@@ 0s has only started it .
and ha@@ ck@@ wise , the computer ha@@ ck@@ ness , because the c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , nin@@ e-@@ 100,000 , tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ four thousand .
and this is now a gigan@@ tic network of very good network , yes , infrastructure centers that have become around the world all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we hold ourselves in a more similar way , and then it &apos;s similar to the same , so that there are more people who can be involved in people else .
and i would invi@@ te everyone to take care of it , and also even trying to figure out what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s not that easy now , but it &apos;s not impossible to do unless you have enough curi@@ osity , and you &apos;re in enough energy , you &apos;ll get far away .
thank you so much for listening .
that &apos;s what it is .
yeah , hell@@ o .
how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that i &apos;m deeply moving as a designer , but also in the course of the research , and also in the field of fin@@ ance , and about all of the things in
and this is about how to track people in inter@@ active media so they can use these inter@@ active media , and so they create a pro@@ gr@@ ession of pro@@ gr@@ ession experience .
i think that the inter@@ active media in us indi@@ rec@@ ti@@ cal , cognitive models , is so predic@@ ted patterns that have been progra@@ mm@@ ed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we &apos;re able to bring it back through inter@@ active media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this tremendous technology that you find that actually gets into the future , but in fact , the future is right to us , but in fact , the future is right to us with our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
now , what are arch@@ a@@ gi@@ an model really ?
i wrote four vie@@ ws , and i &apos;d like to explain to you brie@@ fly .
now , arch@@ a@@ gic cognitive models , which are the models that we &apos;ve ac@@ qui@@ red in the pre-@@ industrial times .
to explain this arch@@ a@@ ic model , we have a principle of essentially natural propor@@ tion to virtu@@ ality .
now this sounds like this , in fact , un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that same time , and i &apos;m going to prove to you about trial that you have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
the second aspe@@ ct is that we &apos;ve been able to speak from this arch@@ a@@ mic model since this arch@@ a@@ mic model , even though we use a co@@ di@@ fied language today .
and the third area , which is really expla@@ ined by itself .
we all know that inter@@ active media is by definition non@@ lin@@ ear , which inclu@@ des the san@@ ity of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and what &apos;s natural to us , of course , is that we feel the lin@@ ear@@ ity today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information on the face of information .
now , how is this with the virtu@@ ality that &apos;s really the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove to you that .
how many do@@ ors have the house in which you live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer that to me immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen at the moment .
they go through this house in the spirit , in which they live , and look at how many do@@ ors there are .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
it virtu@@ ali@@ zes reality , and it doesn &apos;t matter .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
and this is where we &apos;re working on the media cam@@ pus , for example , the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ -@@ lab , and we can actually actually do this all the time .
and this condition , the virtual reality reality to influ@@ enti@@ alize , which had to have the people in the pre-@@ industrial days , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have a books .
or they didn &apos;t have photo@@ cell@@ gra@@ graph@@ y .
they didn &apos;t have any mass media .
the only thing that they had was their head .
and in that spirit , the memory was played .
in this head , knowledge was re@@ vie@@ wed , and with these virtual images , the imagination , the imagination had been passed on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with the virtu@@ ality so well .
and the interesting thing about this is , if i &apos;m going to run out a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s what it is .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that at that time , the human organization was media produ@@ cers and medium itself .
now , if you want to think about a piece of time .
now , what are media today ?
and then you &apos;ll notice that it has a change .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;ll be going to talk about .
the fundamental tools of information appli@@ cations have been since you &apos;ve had stories .
sha@@ man , p@@ rie@@ cher , meaning &quot; knowledge wat@@ chers , &quot; were rele@@ ased for this to keep knowledge in stories .
and even today , we &apos;re approach@@ ing very , very strong about stories .
the auth@@ or of the book of the book , jon@@ a@@ than go@@ bo@@ all go@@ m@@ all , is still han@@ ging a year ago with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories in a year with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories .
it means for a child that has spent it up until reach@@ ing the history of the number of ages of his life with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories .
now we think our love for stories depen@@ ded on us as a child &apos;s la@@ p on the la@@ p of our parents .
no , no , no , very much .
and this goes back much further into the modern times of the pre-@@ industrial times .
but to me , in the area of inter@@ active media , as i think , is that we &apos;ve ad@@ ded to death in our biological memory , the ability to think about non-@@ lin@@ ear , the ability to think about non@@ lin@@ ear .
i brought an example with you from the north american tri@@ be of no@@ ot@@ es@@ -@@ indi@@ ans .
and the lives lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
and as you can see , this is a very in@@ her@@ r@@ onal area , and you had to navi@@ gate somehow , to come from island to island , to get food .
and they did it with what &apos;s called the le@@ dge stam@@ r@@ on .
you may also know that , if you &apos;re interested in this , from the austr@@ ali@@ an agen@@ cies .
they &apos;ve got similar principles .
they don &apos;t have any le@@ gab@@ cards , they &apos;ve got these kinds of gene@@ gl@@ ine son@@ gl@@ ines , or they &apos;ve also got g@@ uns@@ fu@@ cks .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of regi@@ ons could be em@@ bed@@ ded with chimpanze@@ es .
where the language was standar@@ ged by the language of under@@ being .
that is , you encoura@@ ged sound about sound and rhyth@@ m .
and these sounds and this rhyth@@ m have the ge@@ ology that cor@@ respon@@ ded to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region , and it also en@@ ab@@ led that you could re@@ frag@@ ment these songs and put it together and put it back to the left , and then move back to the left , and then move back to the corner of the region .
why aren &apos;t we not sing@@ ing to get from a to b from a to b ?
there &apos;s no way to navi@@ gate .
what &apos;s going to happen out there ?
what happened is that this is such her@@ n machine age .
we &apos;ve moved back into what &apos;s called the a@@ y age .
what happened is the machine age , and it happened to be the book , and it happens , and it happens to be photo@@ cell@@ gra@@ graph@@
and this is exactly what happens is that we &apos;ve shif@@ ted the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and the control of our individual memor@@ ies based on ex@@ ternal media .
on the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god in a way that we have a piece of time .
but virtu@@ ality has become stran@@ ked for us suddenly , and has nothing to do with reality , and has nothing to
bru@@ ce brown , a famous designer resear@@ cher at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , is so far away to say that these mass media , he &apos;s talking about the book and the image , so not television , the internet , etc . , and so on , what we &apos;re saying as a mass media today , that these mass media is fossi@@ li@@ zed , and our ability to virtu@@ alize .
let &apos;s make a small inter@@ print .
from the vo@@ ck age to the machine age .
what is it based on our thinking and on our memory ?
and then there are wi@@ sh@@ ed influ@@ ences of the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
and they &apos;ve been told over cent@@ u@@ ries over the cent@@ u@@ ries of the machine age by the effects of the machine age .
that is , rather than remem@@ ber@@ ing us individu@@ ally , we used to be standar@@ di@@ zed , exten@@ ded , in mas@@ ses of different patterns of memory , to which we can hold our personal memory .
we no longer make any more ourselves .
we have abstra@@ ct language . we have abstra@@ ct language .
we don &apos;t think about it anymore in images that we don &apos;t do anymore in images , but we co@@ di@@ fy them to our language .
we &apos;ve been used to things that are happening lin@@ ear .
and we have accep@@ ted the lin@@ ear@@ ity as the law , and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , like , the non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity .
the thing that rema@@ ins us is the great thing .
still , we are very , very strong than information process@@ ing , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going to happen now ?
we had the bird age , we had the machine age , and we now described what was called cyber@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
it sounds very spac@@ e@@ ful , and it sounds very , very well for science fi@@ ction , i know .
but these concep@@ ts of cyber@@ age , they bring us these op@@ tions back together again to discover our skills .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality ; it &apos;s about non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity ; it &apos;s about a nu@@ st .
i want to explain brie@@ fly a little bit about this .
there are technologi@@ cal concep@@ ts such as the aug@@ mented reality , which is what &apos;s called the exp@@ and@@ ed reality .
so if you look at google glas@@ ses , it &apos;s kind of a concept that &apos;s going to re@@ com@@ bine the virtual world with the real world , which means that our mon@@ in@@ ity to the virtual world , which is virtual than something normal to percei@@ ve natural than something that is normal to percei@@ ve .
another example is what &apos;s called virtual reality .
now , as crazy as i &apos;m talking about , of course , in the context of my talk , we &apos;re moving physi@@ cally in un@@ exi@@ sting , virtual worl@@ ds , right after the image of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ cks .
and other examples are the ambi@@ ents , intelligent systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a person who &apos;s able to re@@ act to
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real life space .
i gradu@@ ated into the video , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project with michael bur@@ k , an@@ ry ka@@ thr@@ in cr@@ ence , j@@ or@@ is mus@@ b and christ@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ -@@ shar@@ ll@@ er .
and then the two last last people are here today .
maybe you &apos;re going to get up for a second , so that she can take care of the project with the two things .
and i brought this project as an example of how again it is to be add@@ res@@ sed by this arch@@ a@@ mic , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say that .
which of course is , of course , extremely obje@@ ctive , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer game , you may have been very likely to find out that some people are looking at some con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on around , or that they play with some con@@ so@@ le in the hand with some con@@ cre@@ te .
so anyway , you do it in .
so this is a game for outside .
and i thought this was thought that i was going to discover the outside world , so i went back to the real world .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data is the data space that we produce , with the real world .
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i have to cut up so much .
now , you can explain it a lot better , there &apos;s more more than it is beyond .
and it &apos;s about being a city , by looking at a city by watching where places were positive or a negative .
and so i get a very different view of the city , which is a very different impres@@ sion , which i see deep and positive z@@ ones of a city , and so on , in this way , a very different micro@@ map of a very real map of a very real city .
and this is what we &apos;re looking at now .
ah , you can see here , sorry , another explan@@ ation of what you see is the same .
of course , this virtual world is living in the walls of our cities , which is clear .
and with a kind of flas@@ h@@ light , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to wra@@ p this together to wra@@ p my talk , in the sense that the tra@@ je@@ c@@ tors and the skills that we &apos;ve made out of the battle period , which is a little bit of m@@ ess in the machine age , that with the help of what &apos;s called the cy@@ ber age age , that , in this way , we can &apos;t get activ@@ ated with complex , technologi@@ cal , new products , in fact , not in the future , but actually to us , to our roots .
thanks very much .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleas@@ ed to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been wondering whether this s@@ ack is a guy &apos;s bag bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you about this .
this is not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to resol@@ ve out what &apos;s inside there .
but i &apos;m not going to do it very well .
yes , kids are naturally curious , or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a par@@ ent@@ y of house , so , of course , i &apos;m involved in the top@@ ic of curi@@ osity , and how the curi@@ osity changes our thinking again , and why the curi@@ osity are still going to be thinking about curi@@ osity , and so on again , we have to re@@ ference and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you have to deal with , and you &apos;re working on your mind as a designer .
if you get a little curious , you &apos;re often going down in such a research se@@ mi@@ ster .
and this is also what i had in the last half of the year .
a research se@@ mi@@ ster at the point of natural healthcare interface .
now , you &apos;re going to ask you , why are the kinds of designers starting to deal with such natural , arch@@ a@@ mic ur@@ ges of communication , inter@@ acting etc and so forth .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices , because things are going to always be more intui@@ tive , always more natural , more energ@@ able , and you &apos;ve got to look at , which is actually for us human beings , which is consum@@ ing friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively .
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve got a design in natural health interface , so the next generation in the network of human computer in which in the relationship of the human computer , we &apos;re talking about how our tools or how the computer is changing from the compu@@ te system to digital assi@@ stan@@ ces .
so i &apos;m going to work with what i &apos;m doing , of course , or intuition .
it may also have to look at it .
why is this happening at all ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s a moment ago , we &apos;re moving away from the third public generation , or the company form .
so from the modern society , we &apos;ve got computer society .
every society is em@@ bed@@ ded by a primary medium .
ini@@ tially , the tri@@ b@@ al society is through the language .
that is , you found that you &apos;ve talked to a collective language , you could communicate with each other , you &apos;ve been dra@@ wn into the same ca@@ ve , or you &apos;re in other areas , you &apos;ve got cities or villa@@ ges , and you &apos;ve created that kind of tri@@ b@@ al society in the same place .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very vi@@ vid .
so , you had to learn too , so no small child can talk about nature , but we learn it , of course , to be su@@ ge@@ ful and power@@ ful .
that was then em@@ powered by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
and this was a big po@@ ck at the time , because you had , of course , to mani@@ fest the living language in the form of writing , which is what flu@@ id and alive is , i &apos;m going to go up and manipu@@ it , and i &apos;m mani@@ pul@@ ating it
depen@@ ding for me , and when i &apos;m be@@ aten , obviously , it &apos;s a very different phr@@ ase , as if there is a lifest@@ yle , of course , as if there is a life of yourself .
but re@@ ck@@ onal , then the scri@@ p@@ t@@ ment of the writing as a primary medium , had decided to take over .
then came the next generation in which we still live today .
this is the pressure of pressure and prin@@ ting scri@@ p@@ ts with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
at the time , it was always a mon@@ r@@ on@@ t where you have a@@ bri@@ d and sing@@ er and others saying , well , you &apos;re really crazy when the people are starting to read , and that &apos;s obviously completely f@@ at@@ al .
and now we get to the next generation , and this is an exciting shift , an alternative shift is just every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really at the moment in this phenomen@@ al phase that we &apos;re doing something about this .
and , of course , that conf@@ uses us , of course , because we &apos;re seeing on the one hand of the new media , and we &apos;re developing social media , and we &apos;re facebook , and so on .
with total transpar@@ ency , which is the new thinking , which is the new thinking , don &apos;t say that in the las@@ ag@@ ames of your mouth , don &apos;t tell me that in the las@@ ag@@ ames of the mouth , and no bee@@ f is more or other phenomen@@ a , which i want to do it , and i want to do it all .
and those two worl@@ ds just wra@@ pped up together , new and old thinking .
now , what &apos;s exciting about this is , if you look at this new society , this new society , this computer society , is under@@ lo@@ cated very many mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ ic paradig@@ es out of the tri@@ b@@ al society .
but now it &apos;s no longer at the local level , but it &apos;s on global level
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that the subject of ec@@ ology is a global world .
i don &apos;t know if i think about local e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , and the neighb@@ or feels less e@@ col@@ o@@ gical , and it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that is , from the local village , actually has become a global village with the same principles , hopefully , of course , intui@@ tively , but the total transpar@@ ency is also more .
as soon as you knew in the village , who has to have what happens to us and when , this expan@@ sion of our self today , this is a global scale on the global level .
be that we know that we &apos;re going to exp@@ and glob@@ ally and more and better .
just as it used to be on the village , it used to be on the village .
so , in front of the background , i &apos;m looking at this , which is , i think , for us , what is still natural for us , maybe what we &apos;re doing , what we &apos;re doing , what is instin@@ ctive for us , what makes the difference ?
because often people are going to be , they can &apos;t use it , so that everybody can hand@@ le it .
so , you &apos;ve got to engage with it , which is , and not only do it change it , it &apos;s going to become better .
and when , of course , when i take something intui@@ tively , and how can i take a character to influence things like this , it makes things so that they &apos;re consum@@ ing , so they &apos;re intui@@ tive , so they &apos;re going to be very intui@@ tive , and they &apos;re easy to use .
and also , in the study of the study , you &apos;ve been talking about perception and per@@ cep@@ tual enti@@ ty .
and that , of course , is also what you &apos;re starting to catch and look at and say , okay , i &apos;m going to just watch myself in the inner self .
and what does it look like in there ?
so , how do we work when we look down in there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intui@@ tively , and how do our chan@@ n@@ els of perception work , and how does the cognitive process@@ ing ?
because steve jobs used to say , you know , you don &apos;t think about the web to look at the web like it .
so you really have to look at this in detail , if i want to make something finan@@ cially sex@@ able or intui@@ tive , which is what it means in the nu@@ cle@@ us .
and you can see that a half of our senses , most of us think we &apos;ve only thought about five , anywhere are even seven , we &apos;re actually going to see the next , ni@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed sense , and as exten@@ sion as we go back to our self , certainly , and as exten@@ sion as an exten@@ sion , again .
and how do we process information , how do we take information on how do we take information ?
every single thing to say , well , what is information ?
information is every distin@@ ction that is a distin@@ ction .
a lot of people use the word , but at least not what it means to be detail .
but i have to understand in the heart , in the mind , when it &apos;s going to be information to information , when it comes from information to information and from information again , so i know how to make things suddenly intui@@ tively , or , of course , to make things happen .
and of course , how do design affect the perception of perception .
we see this , if i paint things , i can make them conf@@ used like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what s@@ alt and pe@@ er , or i can sort of make them intui@@ tively , by showing things .
so much more natural , it &apos;s in a ves@@ sel , but i sort of look directly directly , where is s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er in it .
and if i tell you , give me s@@ alt or pe@@ d@@ gles , it will be the right thing to think about , where is it in it .
and it just intui@@ tive to the left at the left , and then hopefully hopefully that there is no sugar in there , the s@@ alt is going to sin@@ k out .
but our perception as well as our perception of it is as well as well .
so , for example , this perception in context .
the right rou@@ te looks bigger than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s quite the same size , and yet our perception depen@@ ds upon depen@@ ding on what context we &apos;re going to put things out .
does anybody know what this is ?
come on here .
the net action should still work .
there &apos;s a little bit closer to my glas@@ ses .
so it &apos;s all the circle .
so a second circle already begins to cor@@ rect or associ@@ ate certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
and if i still have one hal@@ bo@@ val in one , what we see is not just another unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we see a unit , we don &apos;t see more bits , a circle , a circle , a circle , a different circle .
this is called cra@@ gue gore or secre@@ t@@ ary psychology that &apos;s also affec@@ ting us in perception .
important for the designer , they have most of the first se@@ me@@ ster , the great sc@@ al@@ u@@ ous laws .
small law of short , bra@@ x law of continu@@ ity and so on .
often in the third mind , they &apos;ve for@@ gotten .
but this is a vi@@ vi@@ cally important compon@@ ent , if you just want to make things closer to things , you want to shape things .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the vision .
sounds like ban@@ al , but exc@@ ell@@ ently , when you &apos;re working on this .
so , we have the eyes at the end , and now you think we &apos;re going to see it from the back to the back .
that &apos;s fal@@ se .
you &apos;re going to see it from the back end .
and what they pro@@ ved is an assu@@ mption for the front that they see something that they can recognize , main@@ ly , in a way , of course .
that is , we pro@@ ver@@ tely see our vision before we see it , leaving it back back to back in our sou@@ ner@@ -@@ machine , to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got cognitive feedback ta@@ pe , you &apos;ve got what pro@@ j@@ ings , what you want to see .
and then that &apos;s where there is , then this is going back .
and then it goes back to the front , because that &apos;s not the end of the end , and saying , well , you know , there &apos;s no way to say whether what you &apos;re seeing is also what you &apos;re going to see .
and then it goes back back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
so a very , very exciting process of how certain things are going on and what &apos;s going on for a milli@@ -@@ second set of these things .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to know about you .
there is exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to see something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to recognize what &apos;s happening .
does anybody see a particular thing ?
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , exactly .
once i &apos;ve seen that once , that &apos;s where a d@@ al@@ mati@@ er is inside , then you know this .
you &apos;re never going to forget about it , because i &apos;ll show you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is .
now you can see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
and they &apos;re going on , and now they &apos;re always going to watch it .
that is , i actually haven &apos;t ad@@ ded you to look at them now , that they don &apos;t see more patterns in that , but i &apos;ve been using them in a short period of time , and i &apos;ve got them gene@@ tically modi@@ fied to see this dog in this gl@@ ori@@ ous picture .
and this is this proje@@ ction of vision , feedback , seeing .
now i know that , and i pro@@ ore at the end of this , i think i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ x .
i look at the d@@ al@@ ma@@ el .
so very , very exciting processes , which in this , yes , gra@@ y is really not , but this ro@@ ster mass is happening in this ro@@ tty mass .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
so long , yeah .
so this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something about three seconds , until i look at the present in the last time , i can also pin@@ point very well a very good attention time , where i &apos;m always going to bridge it by three seconds or so .
this is what he needs to work as a present .
and then it moves into the past , and so i can over@@ date very elegan@@ t moments for example on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what is it about $ 25 milli@@ seconds ?
yeah , milli@@ seconds .
a very interesting phenomenon as well .
that &apos;s the time when you fall in love .
that means , a@@ im , if you know this now , you pay attention to which you look like a long time , because i &apos;m not going to go out there , which is what you can see .
and six milli@@ seconds , a very interesting phenomenon , also .
that &apos;s the period of most per@@ cep@@ tions that we have .
that is , the first impres@@ sion is happening in a continu@@ ous p@@ ace of how we percei@@ ve things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re learning about , how we &apos;re going to ex@@ tend ourselves to our environment , so that we can think about it as well .
of course , the computer is not only about cogni@@ tion and neu@@ ral process@@ ing or cognitive process@@ ing or cognitive equipment , but , of course , pri@@ mar@@ ily , with the issue of human@@ -@@ object relationships .
so , how does a human deal with certain things .
there &apos;s some produ@@ c@@ ely practical fun@@ ctions , such for@@ mal aspe@@ cts , or for@@ mal@@ a@@ es@@ thetic aspe@@ cts of aspe@@ cts .
there are pun@@ ques fun@@ ctions where i know exactly where to stop , where i really need to stop .
there are also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , so why does somebody give up a little deal , where there &apos;s no such thing what &apos;s going on , so hor@@ ging a lot of money for money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
and there we are , more of the sym@@ br@@ ens , the kind of skills that we &apos;re dealing with as a par@@ ent , of course .
so back to my point of natural health interface and the subject , of course , which is back@@ wards , is us@@ ability .
us@@ ability always means , how can i achieve a certain amount of goal , or how can a user in a certain use of regu@@ lation are actually effective , efficient and satis@@ fac@@ tly a goal .
this is what &apos;s more like the nor@@ m .
how can i do something that is used to be us@@ eless ?
can i control it right , or i need a hand@@ book , or i need a hand@@ ful of training for that .
and less us@@ able or consu@@ mer@@ ous friend@@ ly .
that i do this just different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s more hand@@ able .
you also have to understand it .
and then , in part , if you par@@ enti@@ ously look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , you &apos;re going to understand why nin@@ e-@@ nine percent of our software today or not is us@@ able on whether nin@@ e-@@ hall is us@@ able , the iphone pad in lots of areas or i@@ -@@ cell phones , even though it &apos;s a lot more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
now , more intui@@ tive us@@ ability is not only ever since apple ever since , a basic economic factor , if i really want to use the technologi@@ cal devices to use people &apos;s technologi@@ cal devices .
why ? &quot;
because , of course , we &apos;re used to this new kind of us@@ ability , which is the natural user fle@@ ature , for example , five times faster to our goal .
you have to imagine this so that if you make something of the classi@@ c sugar , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just one hour of natural software .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re probably able to go home four hours , but your emplo@@ yers or your emplo@@ yers , you &apos;ll notice how he &apos;s going to work with the four hours in accor@@ ding with four hours
but i want to say that it is , of course , an equ@@ ation to us as well as being able to ac@@ qui@@ re certain things .
and so , if we put together again in the software of software , here &apos;s the first vo@@ und line inter@@ faces that were very abstra@@ ct where you took months to deal with these systems .
then , the next thing that happens to you now with the ne@@ y neu@@ ral model or mental model like the software e@@ er@@ gon@@ ere , is that you have a notion of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer us@@ able .
so , no longer zer@@ os and ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but just a metaphor .
and it also made all of a more us@@ eless , but there is a lot better , of course .
the next generation of graphic resources work a lot more with behavior , there &apos;s a lot more
so , as a designer , i sk@@ ank a lot more often the behavior than what you &apos;re looking at .
this is also a paradig@@ m shift as well .
that i suddenly think that the appe@@ ars of the success of success , the us@@ ability is going to become a app@@ lic@@ ation .
and if i go one step further into these natural rural inter@@ faces , where i , by the voice , of language , of touch , of touch and no more of the mouse and the cur@@ sor that needs to control things , i &apos;m still quick@@ er and even immedi@@ ate .
but that brings me back to the point where things are going to be more intui@@ tive ?
if you get more intui@@ tive , and then i have to ho@@ ok my little friend here , and i look at my little friend here , and what does that mean from the point of cogni@@ tion@@ y , when it &apos;s really something intui@@ tively motiv@@ ated ?
and this is always something that is intui@@ tive for us , if i have to think about it as a little bit about it .
so , appar@@ ently he doesn &apos;t want to think about it , but it &apos;s very easy to do it .
the less i think about it , the more more intui@@ tive it is .
and what does that mean to the designers ?
that is , when we look at the fact that we can trans@@ late exi@@ sting models from you on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can make it better than a designer .
that is , i can take a special , kind of an intui@@ tive , inter@@ acting model on a software , and therefore make the software a lot more user friend@@ ly .
and , of course , the question is , what is really the most intui@@ tive pur@@ pi@@ ration of us , and now i &apos;m announ@@ dent to tell you .
this is what we call the o@@ s@@ sal model .
it uses each of us and o@@ gen@@ ity is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m , and it stands to be more ori@@ ent , sel@@ ec@@ ted , trans@@ formed , trans@@ formed .
it makes all of you all the time , but it makes it un@@ consci@@ ously , and it &apos;s basically intui@@ tive or it &apos;s kind of intui@@ tive or par@@ tly instin@@ ctive .
the model is already lo@@ cated in the wom@@ b , and is inter@@ cul@@ tur@@ ally , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by all of us , without most of the time that this model is already present .
o@@ gen@@ o@@ gen about 50 to seven times of us depen@@ ded on activity , so on sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s going to be more often acc@@ ag@@ ul@@ ating than a day .
now i can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te this mental action model , sele@@ ction , transl@@ ating trans@@ faces on an interaction system .
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , simil@@ arly like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top metaphor , but not yet a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a mission pattern , an action of action .
and this is on a higher gra@@ il of the consumer kin@@ dness than the pres@@ cri@@ ption of a classi@@ cal metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top .
and when i go through this now , for example , in which i anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te , i can sele@@ ct , sele@@ c@@ tion@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ box , sele@@ ction as an ele@@ ction , it comes to me , it comes to me , i can look at it in detail , i can look at it in detail , and yes , i &apos;m going to throw that out somewhere , or i can send somebody out and buy somebody and what@@ so@@ ever and so on .
and then i can trans@@ mit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to share this through one last thing .
everyone &apos;s ever e@@ aten a p@@ ie .
over@@ view : now i &apos;m going to interact with the object , and then i can zo@@ om out , zo@@ om out .
i &apos;m going to change the entire over@@ look , and i can now tell you , i &apos;m just going to show you all about cho@@ col@@ ate .
and at once one interface , which is much more intui@@ tive , and much more natural .
because i can control things like the pieces , spon@@ sing them , and they come up to me , is far more natural than if it comes to hier@@ arch@@ ical web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms , and other kinds of mechanis@@ ms can be acc@@ essi@@ ble .
imagination is more like this phr@@ ase , and with that sentence , i want to end up also trying to give you a clu@@ b , and again , designers need to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in that spirit , thank you very much for your attention and for me .
i &apos;d like to take you to a very particular aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
the first , if you get big as a child , is that you have to take care of what const@@ it@@ utes you , right ? and depen@@ ding on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the po@@ ll@@ s , the more , for whether parents have allowed them to play more or less in the po@@ ll@@ s , the more , in some sense , your curi@@ osity will be su@@ cked .
and the curi@@ osity doesn &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why all of them are and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to talk to you now about this whole environmental debate , global break@@ through@@ s , 40 years of clu@@ bs to be able to imple@@ ment in quality
and there &apos;s a central point on it .
and it &apos;s depen@@ dent on phosp@@ hor@@ us .
so , pe@@ e a &apos;s chance .
and every single day , they give steps to about two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and every day they have to take two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us up every single day .
you can &apos;t have teeth otherwise .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have b@@ ones .
we could just jump across the world as am@@ or@@ a &apos;s sa@@ ol@@ ings across the world .
in fact , in fact , we don &apos;t have a phosp@@ hor@@ us , actually , and put it up .
what &apos;s fascinating is that we &apos;re working with something that is , in fact , self-@@ sense , but it &apos;s not that we &apos;re dealing with something that is
because everyone talks about energy , but no one talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
the phosp@@ hor@@ h problem is a lot of cri@@ tic .
we dep@@ end away from two countries .
we only have for two years of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and now we &apos;re now going to be able to put a much more ur@@ ani@@ um in the environment , than in all nuclear environments , as in all nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years alone , five thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ ans have been distribu@@ ted on our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re taking on it .
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a at kids .
and we think we &apos;d protect the environment if we &apos;re a little bit less har@@ m@@ ful .
so , for example , sh@@ ass the environment , the lower car .
sh@@ ass the environment , take less waste .
sh@@ y the environment , power@@ s less energy .
but that &apos;s not an protection .
that &apos;s what , as if i say , sh@@ ass your child , it &apos;s three times as if it &apos;s five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit less de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing .
if we think about the dig@@ su@@ es to the ba@@ pe , our entire earth is going to end up , or later , a ce@@ at@@ us .
it &apos;s about thinking about how it &apos;s about thinking about it .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground as the very first thing .
in the soil , over 6@@ 0s , over 6@@ 0s , it &apos;s stor@@ ed .
at the moment , we &apos;re building cor@@ n , and losing 11 and 30 kil@@ ogra@@ ms per he@@ ct@@ are per he@@ ct@@ are per he@@ ct@@ are per he@@ ct@@ are , or in the square meter , as well as compu@@ ting it .
that is , we &apos;re losing the ground about five times more than new@@ -@@ fold .
of course , we can start looking at the problem problem , of course .
and it &apos;s all pac@@ ka@@ ge or content .
for example , in terms of the age of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , there are 20 percent of the tri@@ ck@@ age in the world .
and because we &apos;re older , the wind is going to grow up .
it &apos;s kind of everybody in the pre@@ val@@ ence of the mountain .
yes ?
a baby needs about six degrees of wind@@ wood .
and of course , we could reduce this by 10 percent , but what is it doing ?
this will be divi@@ ded in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely extin@@ ctive .
so the question is , how are we going to go with these win@@ ds around ?
this is one of the pro@@ of that men are not a pig@@ s .
here &apos;s what i want to tell you .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is provi@@ ded on the lo@@ ad@@ ful compon@@ ent of the com@@ modi@@ ty of ingre@@ di@@ ents .
people are about the ur@@ ine .
yeah .
so men are not able to be a pig@@ s .
because that &apos;s what it looks like , right ?
tradition@@ ally , we think about the environmental debate , we are too many in the world .
and if you tell the people who , if you tell people , if you say it &apos;s better , you don &apos;t know it , you &apos;re going to know it , you &apos;re going to be rob@@ ber and ho@@ sti@@ le
and so someone like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , there is nothing more important than stabili@@ zing human popu@@ lations .
you &apos;re telling you in israel , if you save a human life , you go to the earth .
this is what it says , the more you transform , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too crow@@ ded ?
if you look at the ants , the high@@ th of ants on earth , then the ants are about four times more than we are .
i could also do ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the united states in the united states , no one may be ter@@ mit@@ ed , even though they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans .
that is , the ants wei@@ gh a lot more than we do .
and because they &apos;re physi@@ cally working a lot harder than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in energy consumption , a little bit of billions of people .
that is , we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re sil@@ ent , right ?
and as you see how far we are away , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we are at all on the earth , you can see that , for example , there &apos;s a program , for example , so that it has a program , until 20 years , you want to be a motor eu@@ tra@@ l , right ?
you can only be cli@@ man@@ l if you &apos;re not exi@@ sting , right ?
the only opportunity .
have you ever seen a cli@@ man eu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
yes ?
a single one ?
that is , our whole intelligence means that we want to be bri@@ ber as the trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is a carb@@ on-@@ neu@@ tra@@ l .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , yes .
there is no trans@@ national problem of trees .
there are still six billion trees in the ama@@ zon region , still six billion
you &apos;ve heard about trees before , you know , about trees from trees ?
that is , all of our intelligence means that we want to be wo@@ unded as the trees .
and where you see , even in something like de@@ meter , the wis@@ est bio@@ - , the agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow us to go back out of our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c products .
every year , we &apos;re losing three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us that really wants to go back to res@@ cu@@ e .
and we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s about it .
that means we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio@@ land , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no bi@@ ol@@ el pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s , and as they say all of them , which allow us to go back to our own ex@@ cre@@ ti@@ tions .
isn &apos;t that a sad thing ?
that &apos;s too much of that .
it &apos;s certainly useful to be less mis@@ er@@ able , which is caus@@ ing oil consumption .
now , where are we useful ?
and we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a big foot@@ print that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate , not to be there
so , gra@@ g mis@@ sions , yes ?
you can only have any nuclear pollu@@ ted if you &apos;re not there .
even if they were sho@@ ot@@ ing now , they would have emis@@ sions .
so , you can &apos;t solve it at all .
we can do it different .
we can get rid of our own nutri@@ ents .
we &apos;re doing in brazil agriculture in which we extra@@ ct nutri@@ ents .
in fact , we can get nutri@@ ents back in agriculture in this way .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re directly taking the dis@@ hes of it .
in china , a langu@@ h@@ board today is a s@@ mile ton@@ ight , so , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to get rid of our own nutri@@ ents .
that is , the whole western civilization story refle@@ cts that the city has always taken out , but the farmers never passed back .
it had to grow more and more , because farmers go into cities , and the cities had to go away , and the cities continu@@ ed to get away .
that &apos;s why all of the world &apos;s rich is always exp@@ and@@ ing until they haven &apos;t gotten the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ cked .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve got no@@ st-@@ term civilization over five years , because you &apos;re always able to get back to the nutri@@ ents .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to lunch in china , you expect for lunch that you &apos;re going to stay up until you &apos;re looking at the toi@@ let .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and to take the nutri@@ ents to take it .
they &apos;ve invited them to dinner , not to the nutri@@ tional the@@ ft .
that is , you can see on the internet , how to get rid of the nutri@@ ents .
this really is nice about this , if you do it , agriculture power , it creates bi@@ og@@ as , which is on an ac@@ r@@ ar country in fa@@ vel@@ as , can give you a farmer about a thousand and a half dollars of dollars , and the plant will wait to produce chi@@ ck@@ ens and pi@@ g and sal@@ tables and vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and fish and fish and fish and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate in the fa@@ vel@@ as is about nin@@ e-@@ 20 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be a little bad about this .
we can support them to be a good job .
and of course , this is high-@@ tech agriculture , but the plants themselves carry themselves .
the le@@ ft@@ -@@ product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just rel@@ ate to them .
that is to say , the crime rates are going back .
and none of these things , we &apos;ve built over 100,000 square years now in the last 20 years , none of those things have ever been s@@ ab@@ ated .
they could just throw up a li@@ tter al@@ le@@ l , and then the rain would be ru@@ in@@ ed over years .
don &apos;t find it .
that is , we don &apos;t have to control people to be a little bad about it .
we can support them to be a good job .
that is , we &apos;ve got to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and by the way , if you want to do that , they &apos;re going to write up , in germany , the best part of all the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed facili@@ ties that are in fr@@ her@@ t .
unfortunately , they don &apos;t in the same way , but maybe they can help the lu@@ yers a little bit .
because the fr@@ est plant could get back to the phosp@@ hor@@ us &apos;s system .
and it has to go back .
we can see this that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
and we can see that it &apos;s going to happen .
we &apos;ve been using ourselves now in h@@ oll@@ and now over three years .
the du@@ tch government has expla@@ ined , they &apos;re going to be the first country worldwide , what phosp@@ hor@@ us re@@ f@@ used .
but we need it all up .
you know , there are two countries that control nearly 7@@ 7 percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us population worldwide .
there is op@@ e@@ c pil@@ es a bunch of or@@ phan@@ a bush .
that &apos;s six countries that control 40 percent of the oil supply ves@@ sel@@ s .
and the oil , we &apos;re going to replace it through other energy g@@ uns .
but the phosp@@ hor@@ us is not going to replace .
and that &apos;s not about making the exi@@ sting a bit less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and it &apos;s mostly what &apos;s the right thing to do .
that is , it &apos;s about effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , not efficiency .
in h@@ oll@@ and , of course , it &apos;s easier , of course , because in h@@ oll@@ and the land is constru@@ cted on flo@@ wers .
yes ?
imagine if , for example , if your wife is sa@@ g , if you get married , and you come with 50 of ro@@ ses .
completely in@@ efficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
or take a li@@ p@@ pet pen .
a woman in germany e@@ ars about six pounds three kil@@ ogra@@ ms during her life .
that &apos;s what it is .
this is not an act of science , because we don &apos;t know how much away is going to be k@@ is@@ sing .
but a li@@ p pen , even in that ligh@@ ting , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
a thing that is beautiful in life is no longer efficient .
that &apos;s not a resource efficiency , but it &apos;s effective .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
now , not to burn a little bit better , burning it up , and drop it into the cont@@ amin@@ ation plant and lose all of the materials for cir@@ cles , but first of all , ask , how are you going to re@@ mind flu@@ tab@@ fu@@ es ?
so , imagine mo@@ z@@ art more efficient .
yes ?
if i invi@@ te you to the dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a p@@ ill with simul@@ ated fla@@ vor and a glass of water on it .
wonderful , is it ?
this is more efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , effici@@ ently ?
yes ?
that is , everything that coun@@ ts in life is not going to save up , to avoid .
it &apos;s the whole public discussion .
we tell people , oh , you know , you don &apos;t have a state of the south .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing to throw away , right ?
at any point where you pull away , you go from , you know , you &apos;re going to build opportunities again .
but the fal@@ se things .
if you pull away the wrong things , you have a tr@@ ash problem .
in the way we think about the north .
that &apos;s where every foot@@ print is made up .
when you walk , yes , every foot@@ print destro@@ ys the ground .
because the soil is going to die the mo@@ s@@ ses and the wind , and the water was@@ hes the floor away .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print is that the water rema@@ ins longer in the me@@ es@@ a@@ ws .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large foot@@ print that will be a we@@ t@@ land .
not a scho@@ ol@@ -@@ management .
we say that in germany , we &apos;re sustain@@ ability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how are you going to do something like this with your wife ?
so what do you say ?
aff@@ ord@@ able .
so i say , &quot; heart , sorry , yes ? &quot;
this is just the minim@@ um of coal .
so , don &apos;t save , cle@@ an@@ ing , avoid .
each one of waste is nutri@@ ent .
and it &apos;s a l@@ ust , if you see it@@ al@@ y , people just throw out on the car like this , and they throw it out of the car .
because , you know , it &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s a form of re@@ al-@@ behavior , right ?
you can show me , i &apos;ve been there .
but with the right design , here you go .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a protein me@@ m@@ bra@@ ge , which is at room temperature .
they can throw them away where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants so that it can take them through the way that they &apos;re going through the bio@@ diversity diversity .
that is , we &apos;re useful , not che@@ ap@@ ly on it .
so it forms two cir@@ cles of cir@@ cles .
not all of it should be com@@ pos@@ able .
a television or a was@@ hing machine , they &apos;re just using it , they don &apos;t consu@@ me them .
just the things that disappe@@ ar , like sho@@ h@@ ot@@ es , like bra@@ ck@@ oms , like police , they have to be so that they go into biological systems .
the things that are only being used are going to be in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yes ?
at direct adverti@@ sing , not for the company &apos;s company , pu@@ ma per way , but for example , now they &apos;re helping this business to make these products succe@@ e@@ ded .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore . we don &apos;t do things anymore .
yes ?
so , if i invi@@ te you to the food and say , this is free from cro@@ ps , and it doesn &apos;t really help you .
no , we put what &apos;s inside there .
non@@ eth@@ eless .
so it &apos;s not like de@@ to@@ x .
it &apos;s not tox@@ ic in it .
it &apos;s anything that is in there is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put out the ca@@ val@@ ine of pe@@ de@@ oms , and you can go to the ru@@ b@@ ber in biological cycle , right ?
it &apos;s all com@@ pa@@ thetic about it .
and when we succe@@ ed , of course , we find ourselves , of course , for the ni@@ ke , for ni@@ ke and mag@@ ri@@ tz and all of the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
and this is half of the ab@@ und@@ ance problems worldwide , which are caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
and that &apos;s how they help them with , ask them to ask people .
hey , pu@@ ma , are you really going to be serious ?
because they &apos;ve come up with twice the pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ary of the day .
and i &apos;m not so sure they &apos;re really dis@@ rup@@ tive .
so , let me just help you a little bit about it .
but this is what it is .
yeah .
which is just what &apos;s been recor@@ ded .
that &apos;s what it is .
now , we can do things like this , if you s@@ mile , when you s@@ mile , you can be in biological cy@@ cles .
technical cir@@ cles are the same .
there is something called a direct re@@ nam@@ ge system .
this is the first e@@ col@@ o@@ g back@@ pack , in fact , which is to go back into the cycle .
again , so in every store , you can get things back .
when you get to that , right ?
do you remember the win@@ d@@ le ?
if at the moment , the tr@@ ash is .
and everywhere , these are fl@@ ells all over the place , except .
in the countries where people come to money .
on the edge of the de@@ po@@ bs , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plasti@@ cs so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water ves@@ sel@@ s , they can go back to cell temper@@ atures , then they can plant with a baby in israel or in tun@@ isi@@ a hundreds and hundreds of trees .
yes ?
and just when they take these fla@@ ils , they frag@@ le , ster@@ ili@@ ze , ster@@ ili@@ ze and the po@@ w@@ der , to plant the trees .
that &apos;s where the baby is co@@ her@@ ent for all life , even from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be a motor eu@@ tra@@ l , we can be a climate positive .
it &apos;s kind of an act of a matter of a po@@ at .
yeah , that &apos;s a thing .
yes ?
that &apos;s what we can do .
we can re-@@ inv@@ ent anything again .
i started a institute of this .
mean@@ while , a lot of people work there , and they can all be enga@@ ged .
there &apos;s extra ingre@@ dient to cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le , where everybody can join with it .
so no longer save , cle@@ an@@ ing , avoid , price , no scho@@ ol@@ -@@ management , but smart waste .
does she explain that curious ?
thank you very much .
the work of the interpre@@ t .
music as a language .
in the descri@@ ption of my talk , i wrote that i was a reaction , i was a transl@@ ator , as a transl@@ ator , so in english , understanding .
interpre@@ ts are the transl@@ ator of the written notes in the clin@@ e music .
that you &apos;re not just talking about words for word in another language , but also to understand the deep sense of words and the word edge of words , so there &apos;s no good trans@@ lation , no matter anybody who has to do it with stran@@ g@@ ant .
now transl@@ ating the ger@@ man into english , you can disc@@ uss more knowledge , even if it comes to terms of poetry , when you &apos;re about poetry , or
now stran@@ tly , it is for la@@ kes , what we &apos;re doing with the music language .
as a result of music , i first have only the cele@@ br@@ ated notes .
they think the piece is in the case exactly everything in the case of what he thought there was .
in fact , the notes are very va@@ gue , and it &apos;s un@@ pre@@ cise .
these notes are about equ@@ ally cor@@ rect or un@@ pre@@ cise , as well as a verb@@ al cor@@ d , descri@@ ption of a landscape .
because in this mas@@ s-@@ landscape descri@@ ption , the smell of flo@@ wers is not too cra@@ ck , the degree of the organis@@ m only to be heard , not to feel the colum@@ ns of the wind , not to feel .
that is , the goal needs to trans@@ late these un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented anima@@ tions into another , which is audi@@ ble , con@@ cre@@ te , non-@@ verb@@ al music language .
today i want to share with you what i &apos;m going to do with musical music , so i &apos;m going to trans@@ late in a verb@@ al language again .
so effectively , a trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
that &apos;s why i pre@@ fer to do this as much as i should , because if i had to trans@@ late it into english again , it would be equ@@ ally trans@@ lation to trans@@ lation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spo@@ ken language .
the familiar notes have the function of the letter of a scri@@ p@@ ture .
so it doesn &apos;t really allow me to learn to read just notes , and to press the keys on the piano or the right location on the piano or the right location .
and that would be just the letters that you learned to paint .
the point of the letter is that you can only recognize the language .
so the learning process of music music needs at least as long as the spo@@ ken language of music .
there is also some sur@@ ve@@ ys , whether you learn it for dogs , just understanding passi@@ ve , or you can talk to the musical voice language , until the musical mother gre@@ ator .
the work of the interpre@@ t starts to be kind of like the cur@@ tain of a theater .
once you start to play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re starting to study the forma@@ tion of com@@ position , first of all .
and you collect information about the play in the post-@@ school liter@@ ature .
you get reading in letters , you read ta@@ x , notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of com@@ pos@@ ers .
and you study the works that he had com@@ posed before and after .
you &apos;re compar@@ ing compar@@ es .
the conditions ada@@ tribu@@ te it .
how , what did he feel like ?
how were his species , what are its communities and politics ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
you think about it in this period , for example , to look at con@@ temporary images or liter@@ ature .
but over time , you &apos;ve also noticed a rich knowledge around the com@@ po@@ wer that you play , and it falls as easy to think about it , and it falls to feel like you &apos;re feeling in it .
and the choice is going to be more and more to music that you live with .
his concern@@ s to write the play is going to be more and more to my personal concern@@ s to play it .
so as the notes , everything else is a pre@@ cise repres@@ entation of the event of com@@ pos@@ ers , but just a frame@@ work , i now throw this frame@@ work to fill it back to mind and meaning .
i &apos;m going to tell you about my own words , what could be written between this frame@@ work .
i play expla@@ ining what that sounds might have to mean .
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ er at the time , and what you might mean for him today .
every sound , every phr@@ ase , gets a sense , because i feel it myself , because i get a lot of it myself , because it &apos;s very good from my current current .
it has to be influ@@ enced to me now , and now controll@@ ing my audience , otherwise , i don &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very fortun@@ ate conc@@ ert , if i can have the experience , the play that i &apos;ve been working on as long as i &apos;ve been working on as long as i &apos;ve been trying to experience how to
how you &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing a happy new day , even though you &apos;re always with the same ritu@@ als of life , up , break@@ fast , break@@ fast , to work , i &apos;m going to do the same thing over and over again , so i &apos;ve done the same thing over and over again
i &apos;ve become older again , continu@@ ing for seas@@ ons , my pul@@ ge is slo@@ wed down at night than the morning , in a conc@@ ert theater , there &apos;s more to get the sound back back than at home .
i choose the audience to be aware , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
all of this is affec@@ ting me , and all of it also affec@@ ts my experience with com@@ position .
and it &apos;s wonderful , too , when i &apos;m standing with a du@@ o partner on stage , and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
and then the same thing happens as in a good , serious conversation .
you bring a new idea in , and as a result , this is what &apos;s going to answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because what happens is that things that we didn &apos;t really inv@@ ent and what you can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience have experience how the music communic@@ ates .
so each conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this , like that moment .
i can &apos;t play that much today as in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and i &apos;m going to hear about my pal@@ ette of music , even more mobile nu@@ an@@ ces , emotions and sen@@ sation than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to sna@@ p some color bag@@ s too , but i &apos;m going to have to get a new phone .
have a nice con@@ cre@@ te example of it .
it was on a piano cur@@ re@@ l for music students at my belo@@ ved old teacher , professor j@@ ack@@ y u@@ ds , a well-@@ known ca@@ tho@@ val speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist and long years of music scho@@ ol@@ -@@ school professor here in high school .
unfortunately , i was much too young , so he had already been mir@@ r@@ ated when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortun@@ e to meet him very early , at three years , and so i &apos;d been on his clas@@ ses at my school .
i was 17 when i was on one of his clas@@ ses and played back on one of his cour@@ ses of ch@@ op@@ in , a period of time .
he wonder@@ ed what the pur@@ pos@@ ation of this bal@@ let was for me .
this is kind of a tra@@ wn .
and in my you@@ li@@ gh@@ ty , i said , expec@@ tation .
and he was sha@@ king and said , &quot; so ?
that has to be the age of aging .
because to me , she re@@ minds me .
he &apos;s been over six .
well , at 17 , you &apos;ve got dreams still , but you don &apos;t have a major memor@@ ies .
i play the piece of every couple of years today , and it always has trans@@ formed for me , although there is no one in the world changing .
every time it &apos;s exciting , it &apos;s exciting , because every time i read something new .
an example of this is a very different area . mon@@ et pain@@ ted the se@@ cular x .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in a variety of days , there &apos;s different light .
and he transl@@ ated the se@@ cular diver@@ ses , as he saw it , as she saw it , as she was doing it on the course of it
his personal speci@@ ali@@ tions of the se@@ str@@ ands .
the x-@@ son@@ t interpretation of a piece of it is that compar@@ able .
mean@@ while , i &apos;ve been more than a ch@@ op@@ in at the age of 21 , when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s only lived nin@@ e-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years .
and i &apos;m really important to look at the notes again , even if i mean , you can memor@@ ize it .
so holding mathema@@ uses , right with com@@ pos@@ ers .
because the notes are the only link directly to him .
most of all , if he &apos;s died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you need to have about the same time as long as the spo@@ ken language .
a lot of times music is so that you learn the notes to read the notes .
and you can tell prac@@ tically before you &apos;re talking about just one word .
you learn how to find the sound to the sounds on the instrument .
and when all the money is going on and right , like it &apos;s in the notes , they come out and they look at sound that sounds like this , which sounds like music .
when the lack of failure happens , the student gets the next , difficult piece .
it &apos;s har@@ dly speaking at the very beginning of the trial .
all right , so there &apos;s pre@@ st@@ o at the end of the day , which is a quick piece .
len@@ to , slowly .
l@@ oud and bra@@ x , f and b , etc , etc .
most of us know this .
but even when you put those attac@@ ks , there &apos;s still a little bit technical .
and yet , it &apos;s always not interpretation .
i &apos;m w@@ ying myself .
and i &apos;m wondering you &apos;re often enjo@@ ying something as essential .
nam@@ ely , to make music on the instrument that should be your musical , and feel like there &apos;s supposed to be there before
that &apos;s what sing@@ ers are .
a kid who hasn &apos;t learned to sing , because the parents didn &apos;t do it , it will not do it .
it &apos;s like talking about speech .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experience and idea of music , then another possibility , about an instrument , is about bringing it to sound .
people who never pay attention to each other have never felt an out@@ come with their own body , as it is to form a note .
to shape a phr@@ ase with his own breath .
the music comm@@ ange@@ ment is that the expan@@ sion of our body .
and we have our vo@@ cab@@ ines to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so , the ham@@ man heads in the piano are the sequ@@ el of my fing@@ ers .
the mel@@ o@@ dy comes out from the patient and the rhyth@@ m out of the dance .
the continu@@ ous narra@@ tion today , with music , is not free .
you don &apos;t have to do music anymore when it gets bor@@ ed .
no longer nee@@ ds to whi@@ st@@ le or to sing a hat@@ ch .
every single music is going to be gener@@ ated by the outside of music all the time .
sur@@ ely , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing it ?
can you ask me , can you sing , a , because you don &apos;t think they can sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned how to sing@@ e ?
and in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to find out whether you can &apos;t yet find it , or learn how to put these little mus@@ cles that affect the mo@@ od of the text proper@@ ly .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re training .
or c , because you &apos;ve given it to you that they &apos;re un@@ fol@@ ding .
so , i ask , how do you make a diagno@@ stic conc@@ ern ?
have you taken a second point or a third opini@@ on , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful today ?
or , yes , you don &apos;t like music and you want to have ni@@ x to do so .
now , what i &apos;d like to re@@ gre@@ t is because music is a beautiful , communication thing .
but maybe you also can hand@@ le it .
well , you can see , all of the cases , no one needs to be a spo@@ ck@@ ing-@@ looking can@@ di@@ date .
but don &apos;t tell me , i don &apos;t know about classi@@ cal music .
i can &apos;t tell you whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and i &apos;m going to answer , but i &apos;m sure you can tell whether it &apos;s like or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it ta@@ stes me , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok it .
so , don &apos;t get stuck to eat , just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so they don &apos;t have to hold up on classi@@ cal music , because they don &apos;t have an instrument .
listen to consci@@ ously and say whether it ta@@ stes you or you don &apos;t tell them .
whether the music is blo@@ cked you or too c@@ ute .
tell what it feels you feel .
and over time , they get acc@@ essi@@ ble and they want to have a little bit more po@@ ll@@ s there , or they even want to have a dam@@ n distin@@ ction .
now , why am i appl@@ ying from my audience that it &apos;s also going to sound active ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of art that you never look at has no force to act .
the food that was coo@@ ked by a che@@ ck or a co@@ at of love , has to be f@@ ought and not just mel@@ ted or re@@ co@@ ved or reci@@ pes .
so listen to me when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice hor@@ n ta@@ pe@@ pe@@ t .
if in a context where the adults are active music , or at least active music , a child gro@@ ws up , it &apos;s easy for a music teacher to ask , what color does your flo@@ wer have ?
now , can you play me in the blue also ?
and the child plays , after a memor@@ er , instead of a red flo@@ wer , rather than a red flo@@ wer .
and this sounds very different than ever before .
and then this was the very first end of a musical expression .
so the first step to do is to make a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , which is ini@@ tially a hundred or a half thousand years ago , so that &apos;s been written before a hundred thousand years ago ?
mean@@ while , the instru@@ ments have been evol@@ ving .
there was no news at the time as an instrument as a public .
it was just not exi@@ sting yet .
i think the b@@ ach would have been thri@@ ll@@ ed if he had had the mobile opportunity of today &apos;s modern spe@@ al@@ ers .
i can today , today , have the sound cap@@ abilities that the b@@ ach had to hear on the modern wing , which a b@@ aro@@ ck@@ y c@@ em@@ bal@@ o can &apos;t .
you know , bee@@ tho@@ ven also knows that he heard more when he had gotten dea@@ f .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything , which is an orche@@ str@@ a from that time as an orche@@ str@@ ous orche@@ str@@ a .
that &apos;s why the com@@ pos@@ ers rely on telling us interpre@@ tations that re@@ inv@@ ents the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be listen@@ ing , which they &apos;ve only thought of themselves in the spirit .
and also , what they would think about in the spirit today .
or the one thing that i pre@@ tend to do today , because what you might have thought about today .
thank you very much .
do you know what od@@ d is ?
have you ever been a p@@ un@@ k ?
and how did that feel ?
su@@ ck out .
i have a friend , a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i , a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
and when i come up with my little piece of work pi@@ es@@ el and myself , i &apos;m going to hear this feeling up .
i &apos;m going to sho@@ ck something through my head .
i say , &quot; ul@@ el , what are you going to do with a big car ?
now , this is the first year half of his prof@@ ern .
and all of you , you &apos;re working less than i did .
why am i going to afford a little car like this ?
and then immediately , that &apos;s un@@ fair to me , that &apos;s un@@ fair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice , this un@@ pleas@@ ant sen@@ sation is gone .
and our organis@@ m has invented a great way to get those un@@ comfortable emotions just like just to get away to disappe@@ ar .
you can also try to do it with words like ra@@ ge or w@@ ash or something like that .
i &apos;d like to explain to you with this mechan@@ ism today , or to take something out of what &apos;s un@@ conscious about you .
the mechan@@ ism is made out of the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard it , when people say , no one has the inten@@ tion to build a wall .
and then st@@ ones went up , so he &apos;s going to pick up the view .
at one point , you can see that the li@@ ars itself doesn &apos;t believe what he &apos;s saying .
and it &apos;s easy to check that it has a very different sense of meaning .
he &apos;s just cr@@ ying her and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , it has to do with itself .
they need this lie to be a li@@ f@@ ten@@ ed gap , to get a self-@@ de@@ ception .
they can get them less easy , yes , se@@ arch@@ ing , or they &apos;re going to kill you .
they &apos;ve got time .
there is an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you may know from this period .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ as@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once ow@@ ned a woman portra@@ him .
and this woman , once op@@ posed to the portra@@ it , would tell you the portra@@ it you didn &apos;t even see
pic@@ as@@ so ans@@ wer@@ ed , wait only out .
it &apos;s going to be more like you .
and at this point , and you lau@@ gh , you realize how important this lies is and how much time you need to experience something , which artists can share very well .
because artists have a dis@@ rup@@ tive relationship to lying .
the artist is giving you something about it , and above all of this lady , what you don &apos;t see if you just look in the mirror .
the artist is giving you something like this , which is something that you &apos;ll be familiar with when you look at this art work over and over again .
and then this un@@ pleas@@ ant sen@@ sation , it can &apos;t even see you , and it will always be more like it .
and here you have this mechan@@ ism that we can use the lie as a great invention to stabili@@ ze our lifest@@ y@@ ings .
and not only in art , even in the tren@@ k@@ ness , in the my@@ th@@ ology , in stories , it &apos;s back again .
you may know this idea from the lady who looked at the mirror every morning and asked him who is the most beautiful thing all over the country ?
one day this mir@@ r@@ ors is saying , yes , there &apos;s a nice one .
and behind the seven mountains and so forth .
and they also know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty from this matter , the mirror cannot lie , cannot lie out of that true .
but we should just make sure that you can &apos;t tell one woman , that there is a nice somewhere somewhere else .
here &apos;s what we need to understand the poli@@ tic cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness , to bring over and over again .
we need this kind of lie that &apos;s going to keep us out of de@@ ception without which we can &apos;t live at all .
we have not only in art , in jen@@ k@@ ism , but in science as well as a great lie .
and there is this story from the wife of the bis@@ cho@@ che of no@@ che@@ ster .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of the species and the ab@@ und@@ ance of the man .
that the man should come from the mon@@ keys and , yes , it would have a common ance@@ st@@ or at least between people and mon@@ keys .
and then she ran her man to her husband , and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s probably not true what charles &apos;s writing out there . &quot;
you should have a common ance@@ st@@ or out of the mon@@ keys or a common ance@@ st@@ or .
no , no , that &apos;s not what it is .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to stop that people know about it .
why do we prevent people knowing what &apos;s true about something when it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live these li@@ ts without any other life .
because we have this self-@@ de@@ ception , that feeling of being great , from the highest being of the highest being , not from such a distin@@ ct , from something like this , of something un@@ predic@@ table like a organis@@ m , which is still there , a stone compar@@ able , and other things , it &apos;s inevi@@ table to us .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
we have to stop that people are strug@@ gling from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so , in order to see how slowly this mechan@@ ism does , and how the tra@@ cks look at it , it &apos;s going to look at something that leads to something else than on this great image of ourselves , so i want to introdu@@ ce you another story .
it &apos;s a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told her to tell me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she was telling him about a student .
this is an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
she &apos;s particularly like him , because he has a tenden@@ cy to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze .
and she asked him , &quot; what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ? &quot;
and he says , &quot; well , i &apos;m at the fire@@ men . &quot;
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ gen@@ gic things .
yes , you feel it , if you &apos;re sa@@ ther@@ er at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said to my wife , always when a human repres@@ entation is using the argument because using it , we should try to replace it through the words even though it &apos;s
do that once , and then you learn the sentence .
even though i &apos;m in the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ engineering things .
they feel , this is the actual truth behind the out@@ come .
this is a little bu@@ b that doesn &apos;t care about the fire .
it &apos;s more interested in the fire .
but there are no ver@@ sions where we can look around where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best thing , the fire men .
that &apos;s where he sig@@ ned up .
and this , you don &apos;t say , your teacher doesn &apos;t tell you that you like to get a be@@ a@@ ff somewhere , and you look forward when the fire was lo@@ cking off .
no , it just looks a lot better when we show that we &apos;re constantly constantly trying to pen@@ et@@ rate the dan@@ gers , the other one , when they replace the fire .
and here you have these little mechan@@ ism .
and these ver@@ g@@ esses that in the front of the bu@@ b , they knew that he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say he &apos;s saying that .
here you have this head@@ bridge between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , which is inst@@ ant , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know very differently you look very different on , you know , you can hear a lot better for you and others .
and so simply those words that we &apos;re going to use in the language of poli@@ tically accu@@ rate speech and again .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know when we present that out , social propor@@ tions are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t quite do that .
it &apos;s impossible to present these things in a society that is supposed to work .
i &apos;d like to argue to you now what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
so what lo@@ gic is that de@@ ception , that self-@@ de@@ ception , the will@@ ing@@ ness , another reality than the one that we actually know in the un@@ conscious familiar understanding that it &apos;s mobile to spread outside .
i &apos;m going to present to you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is that many of you know what many of you and some of you esti@@ mate , a few of them just don &apos;t need to need .
i &apos;m talking about the sou@@ l .
so what is the sou@@ l ?
and the sou@@ l is such a sort of spi@@ cial thing , about lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
it &apos;s something that is not a stop@@ -@@ gener@@ ated , materi@@ al-@@ of-@@ materi@@ ist nature .
and if you have people who are the most comfortable belief that you have a sou@@ l , or you can also say that it has been brought from the sou@@ l to life , then that &apos;s kind of like the sou@@ l as if the sou@@ l is such a spi@@ ritual frame@@ work about them , not from matter , they &apos;re just from meat and blood , something ste@@ ep@@ ly , un@@ belie@@ vable , un@@ belie@@ vable , un@@ belie@@ vable , un@@ belie@@ vable , un@@ belie@@ vable , and
and from this sou@@ l , you remember that in this clou@@ d@@ case nature , it &apos;s in this evil natural , in this gl@@ ory nature , anim@@ a is present in la@@ tin , g@@ ust , of being present .
and when this gl@@ ory is then mel@@ ted over the people , then he &apos;s filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with spirit , with nature that just can live with , right with sou@@ l .
and then he can walk along .
and this is the idea of how the sou@@ l works .
so she &apos;s going to get away from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re going to be thinking about it as something that &apos;s going to be pre@@ domin@@ ant for our lives .
and if you have that pre@@ mis@@ e , you can understand the lo@@ gic that we experience this lu@@ ck , that we can make a difference in our world , better .
because now they can apply a three-@@ set .
three steps later , they still know from school .
now this is a three-@@ section that descri@@ bes us a lo@@ gic .
and that &apos;s the har@@ dest part of my talk , by the way .
here you need something lo@@ gic , but also the will@@ ing@@ ness is to lie .
nam@@ ely , it &apos;s saying that they can just use this lo@@ gic .
in this three-@@ sentence , three sent@@ ences are coming .
the first sentence is saying , saying , there is no sou@@ l .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;ve got sound right , it doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
now there is a third sentence .
i was particularly blo@@ wn it up here .
a third sentence , which happens immediately in people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l , it &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and this is what they feel .
here comes this lo@@ gic in this , yeah , in this illusion , it &apos;s an expression .
and you can see it immediately .
the first two sent@@ ences , they &apos;re logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
i can tell you everything .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make a clu@@ e about reality .
i can tell you the doctor is a man .
and when i &apos;m right , then the doctor is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , the doctor &apos;s no man is no man .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make a stat@@ ement about what &apos;s going on .
i can cla@@ im anything .
but the key thing is , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s going to happen .
so , when you say sound says , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
secon@@ dly , when he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
these things are logi@@ cal cor@@ rec@@ tly .
and now our de@@ fau@@ lt consciousness seems to feel immediately , you can do something .
it depen@@ ds on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences , which is pre@@ cis@@ ely as though the opposite of the first sentence has already dec@@ lar@@ ed and pres@@ ented .
because , in fact , we have to prove whether it &apos;s a sou@@ l or not .
but with this lo@@ gic that &apos;s just using it that two sent@@ ences are logi@@ cal , and a third of it , which looks as if it has something to do with it , we can save our li@@ ve@@ li@@ hood of life
so , we pre@@ tend it doesn &apos;t actually be impossible without a sou@@ l .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can aug@@ ment these things in different examples .
in the present part , we have a very modern example that always fil@@ ls the da@@ y@@ hol@@ ders .
this is one more philosop@@ a philosop@@ hi@@ cal theme , a perman@@ ent stran@@ ger from philosoph@@ y , right ?
and that has to do with that , that we &apos;re going back to the four@@ th century .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ist who was named jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and he was named the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ ese es@@ el .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an es@@ el is a es@@ el that is made of p@@ ure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that sou@@ l .
and this is a natural thing .
and if you put the ex@@ act right in the middle of the middle between two big big ha@@ cks , it &apos;s going to go out .
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be going on first .
so , he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the natural things are pres@@ ented .
there are big power@@ s that are lin@@ ked with each other with each other .
there is nothing happening at all .
it &apos;s only when you get another example , so if you do it immediately , it doesn &apos;t require any reason and it doesn &apos;t require any reason .
auto@@ matically is going to go to the right idea .
now , if you have this idea that you somehow have driven in nature , which is based on the larger quanti@@ ties , you &apos;re going to have a very quick feeling , you &apos;ll have a sense that there needs to be something like free .
and if we &apos;re here in frank@@ gra@@ t , i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ ner institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ist who is called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and he &apos;s sometimes telling him , you know , wol@@ f sing@@ er argu@@ es , there are no pur@@ pos@@ es of freedom .
now , we can form the second sentence again , and we can tell if wol@@ f sing@@ er has right , he doesn &apos;t have a wel@@ come freedom .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rec@@ tly .
and what we can read now about a daily newspaper in the late paper , which is what you find in this third sentence .
it looks like this is something that doesn &apos;t have a willing freedom , it can &apos;t be driven for its app@@ lic@@ ation and cla@@ ims to responsibility , and therefore it &apos;s un@@ sustainable .
again , here you have it again .
in fact , you have to prove if there is something like pur@@ pos@@ ing for free .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to pre@@ tend to be as though the first sentence of the first sentence is wrong , as evi@@ dent is , of course , to take the contr@@ or without evidence .
and now they can just just , if they want to do anything themselves , if they want to test anything themselves , and particularly if they want to enjoy people , they practice this coura@@ ge to lie .
practice this for example , if you present to a person that you can tell you , there &apos;s no predic@@ t@@ ant .
and don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predic@@ t@@ ant , which is prop@@ he@@ t , that &apos;s called prop@@ he@@
you can &apos;t call it that , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit more poli@@ tically cor@@ rect .
say , there is no predic@@ t@@ ant .
immediately , you &apos;ll find one thing that there is , of course , that there are predic@@ ts , you can &apos;t prove that .
and already , you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re working on it , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there is no predic@@ t@@ ant , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he &apos;s dec@@ ei@@ ved .
it &apos;s because he has led them on a cli@@ ff where he doesn &apos;t stop himself .
because , in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s only interested in being able to prove that there &apos;s predic@@ t@@ ant to prove that there is predic@@ t@@ ant .
so , in the kind of shif@@ ting of copy@@ pil@@ e , they experience the magni@@ fi@@ dness of the lie .
and if you have one option again to feel this three-@@ sentence in other people , do it , because they &apos;re going to be happy , because they &apos;re not going to remember their confidence in that way .
thank you very much for your attention .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
i was allowed to ask li@@ l@@ ly , if i could tell you , &quot; if i can tell you . &quot;
she &apos;s one of the things that is great here from this great event , and asked me if i &apos;m going to take a talk here and give me my idea .
i have to say , hon@@ est@@ ly , you &apos;ve got it , it was hard to talk to me earlier about my idea .
and i don &apos;t want to imagine my case project that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum of a lot , a lot of ideas .
now , i guess the two nice girls still , i think , are still in the generation of this bad oil image , because i &apos;ve probably started to say to the generation that i &apos;ve been doing nin@@ ually , because i &apos;ve come to study nin@@ e-@@ 100 nin@@ e-@@ nine &apos; 7@@ 0s , tech school , and now she says , k@@ it .
and i was laugh@@ ing at ber@@ lin in the middle of the ei@@ gh@@ ter years because i wanted to make rene@@ w@@ ables , and i couldn &apos;t give it to a car@@ rot .
there was the record of le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ te .
it was all the k@@ f@@ a , also the je@@ f@@ a was called k@@ f@@ a .
it &apos;s a project of projects today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
but something do@@ o@@ l like &quot; s@@ ar solar pen@@ del , &quot; made out of a sort of hundred wat@@ ts out of the square meter , which was a to@@ y .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m a pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a-@@ man gr@@ ate@@ ful that he had re@@ hab@@ ili@@ ted the word back again , because after the ow@@ ner , you didn &apos;t care about the word , because everything left left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that much year in the year year .
it used to be that there was self-@@ medi@@ ated alternative interven@@ tion , and one of them was in cross jun@@ t@@ berg in a range of places where you would think of the evil .
place of terror@@ ism , but it was called the am@@ tr@@ on@@ ics , and it made wind and solar energy , and i started to start in the middle of the ei@@ gh@@ th century .
and yeah , a lot of what i &apos;ve been told today is because a lot of , many , many beautiful refle@@ ctions that i &apos;ve also lived through .
i &apos;ve been working in the collective for 11 years , which was the base democratic .
we were a tw@@ ent@@ y people .
if a woman said no , the v@@ et@@ op@@ rin@@ z@@ y@@ p , which is a completely fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , and i was really hard to find out if i was really going to get my great engineering college , because all my father &apos;s colleagues have always ad@@ mit@@ ted him , and all the colleagues of my father have been talking to him , and you &apos;ve always sle@@ pt the money to the window with your child .
it &apos;s wor@@ rying with dis@@ pu@@ te .
and that really was very , very bit@@ ter , and you can get in like this stage in the middle of it , and i thought this was going to stop a picture where i asked myself 10 years , a thousand square mar@@ row , that was , at the time , in the collective , of course , whether that really should be this a@@ wes@@ ome thing .
and i passed it up to six times nin@@ s , and then we got together with friends with friends , and then i became co-@@ involved with the company of the company , which was one of the largest cell manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world .
a huge story , but also we have the problem again of a growing company , and we have a two-@@ thou@@ cher problem , a small group , we decided that we will start back back and forth and end up the next issue of the future , and that means that , and in fact , it &apos;s kind of crazy , and it &apos;s kind of crazy again , that people say , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going on , that people say , what &apos;s going to do , we &apos;re going to talk about stor@@
and i brought a project with you , which i &apos;m going to show you now .
and the ti@@ tle of the pres@@ entation was , well , how to get to a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and we &apos;ve just just started asking with a relatively simpli@@ stic story , where maybe you can use a memory of memory today .
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ at@@ age .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
now , they have a rene@@ w@@ able energy rate of fif@@ mer@@ able energy .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have any more ?
it doesn &apos;t just work technologi@@ cal .
when you build more wind power together , the system begins to fail .
this is what i also tell the politicians when they &apos;re in ber@@ lin ad@@ staf@@ sh@@ y@@ ard , where they are our plant .
they always say , well , why ?
we &apos;ve already had 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent , and our network is physi@@ cally the european one .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people on this island have already shown .
the question was just , calcu@@ late that was two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ on@@ ago , have the first cont@@ ents of the rain started out , but it just took away .
how big would actually be like a battery so that you could have an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 45 , 50 , maybe even 7@@ 0@@ 0,000 percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go back to a slide again .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , there are about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of electric power in the world , and in the world .
this is the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s very rapi@@ dly everywhere .
the energy loss of the world that &apos;s going on is going to be del@@ et@@ ed with this el , because there &apos;s no need to be appro@@ ved .
this is going on fast .
you put it in a box like this .
and then it &apos;s the case that it &apos;s usually like this
in the process , three of those are wa@@ ited , two of them always wa@@ ited .
yes , this is what this is looking at at the bottom is the load .
we &apos;ve also got a very pre@@ cise data .
and the wind system or the solar system , or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ page system , or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ page system , or it can only store a system where it can only be stor@@ ed in small quanti@@ ties here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the dies@@ el is going to be ta@@ pe@@ -up , and the wind , the sun , is controll@@ ing the bur@@ den so they can form the larger number .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent rene@@ w@@ ables , energy a year , not the power at the moment , you &apos;ve got to switch out the dies@@ el .
that is , at this moment , you have to make sure that the rene@@ w@@ ables of rene@@ w@@ ables can actually take the entire grid .
of course , they can only do that , of course , if they &apos;re being man@@ ned here in some way .
that hasn &apos;t been done in the world before .
this is a little bit of stuff , so you can use your r@@ asi@@ ers on the car as well as a ro@@ ad@@ way .
people always ask me , &quot; what are you going to do in ad@@ dor@@ sh@@ ard ? &quot;
this is what &apos;s happening .
but if you want several of these conver@@ sa@@ tions together , and you want to build a network , it &apos;s going to become extremely complicated .
and our goal was that we wanted to get at 7@@ 0s to nin@@ e-@@ 20 percent rene@@ w@@ able , and then there &apos;s another rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent rene@@ w@@ able with , it &apos;s going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work , either , that &apos;s going to be made out of bat@@ ter@@ ies .
it &apos;s going to be a energy fu@@ ber , which is , you know , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas , you know , it will be .
they &apos;ve got to go to a seas@@ onal store , and winter summer , and not just ta@@ g ta@@ gs .
we just wanted to know what it is with a regular , run@@ less electro@@ chemical battery .
how far are you going to get there ?
and then we did a whole bunch of simu@@ lations .
and they divi@@ ded wind and sun and the bur@@ den and came to the conclu@@ sion , a very interesting conclu@@ sion that you had to go to the conven@@ tional system , which for 20 years per kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour took a kil@@ o@@ watt hour of about 50 cents a kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t@@ ary hour .
these were the very first calcu@@ lations of calcu@@ lation six years ago .
and then we said , all right .
we have great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re che@@ aper like the same as the same price , when the same price is five percent per year .
and then we started negoti@@ ating with insu@@ lan@@ ts .
what would everything have to be done ?
have inv@@ e@@ stors com@@ mis@@ sed with inv@@ e@@ stors , and i &apos;ve been looking for new local she@@ ets .
so we were only five people to re@@ build one to re@@ build the society .
and again , this is the picture .
and the brown is kind of the conven@@ tional system , the green is our system .
that our system is also a price rise , because we have tw@@ ent@@ y percent of the time , and we &apos;re not going to hit a price on the other things , and it &apos;s also not a price of cost on the other things
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty , which produ@@ ces the electricity company on the island , is meant to find that very nice .
do we want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so in ber@@ lin , we decided to build a hall in which we could sort of map the electrical connec@@ tivity of the island in the scale of one to three very pre@@ cis@@ ely .
that is , we &apos;re going to start finding the world &apos;s largest bat@@ ges in the
here she is .
and that comes from asia , in which case from japan .
and in fact , she &apos;s funny in the &apos; 7@@ 0s at b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , and he was now developed , and then she was li@@ f@@ ted to the japanese .
and you can see , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has achie@@ ved a me@@ ga@@ watt performance , and it can get six hours long , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;ve sort of gotten a simulation technology out of .
and then they took it up .
we also have one of these same ag@@ gre@@ gate in the same size , as it turns out , in the hall , in fact , the entire dynamic behavior of this grid , so in the hall , it looks like this now , here &apos;s the big sort of dynamic behavior , here &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the entire economy that we simul@@ ate with the grid .
over here , we simul@@ ate the entire trans@@ mission system , the kilometers of the c@@ ables of the c@@ ables , to sort of map the vi@@ bra@@ tion behavior in the grid .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can go to the grid as well as two kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ts of genetic vol@@ ta@@ ics .
this is what we see again , again , again , again , again , this is the same , single ag@@ gre@@ p again .
and what we &apos;ve done since a two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -@@ month was the middle , until today , a two-@@ thou@@ gh@@ ted age is almost everything that we &apos;ve done in between the individual system of electr@@ on@@ ics , of software , we &apos;ve done .
so we &apos;re not a bat@@ er manufac@@ tur@@ er , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the top@@ um and the universe , and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to the battery , you &apos;ve got to communicate on the grid , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that , in fact , in this island , you can basically take away the pre@@ mis@@ e of problems that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our con@@ vent of rene@@ w@@ ables .
so this whole discussion , which is going to move out at the moment and pull out energy , as we should go to the island , for example , for example , for about 16 to 30 percent accu@@ rate , so we &apos;re going to address the wind and the sun rules .
natural light provi@@ des a smar@@ t-@@ activ@@ ist .
so , smart grid , a huge issue everywhere .
we can begin to integra@@ te electro@@ mo@@ ma@@ cy on the island before , you know , you can actually manage the load .
that is , if you &apos;re more rene@@ w@@ able at 7@@ 0@@ 0,000 percent , you won &apos;t be able to do it without any stor@@ age .
you can go through &quot; smart grid , &quot; you can go through the nets , yes , you should be doing it , you &apos;re going to hear the numbers , but you &apos;re never going to be able to do it in store .
and that &apos;s not what the message is like .
that &apos;s why a lot of people get there , and they look at it , just because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn asi@@ de into the dies@@ el , you don &apos;t have any more of these pi@@ tat@@ ing mass that causes a certain kind of ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy on the grid .
and our european network network is essentially only made out of ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of big power plants , where the wave is all around europe .
we look in this network , look at the fif@@ th-@@ 3 her@@ tz , and if it gets nin@@ e-@@ four com@@ ma , nine her@@ tz , we &apos;re going to start making a couple of wa@@ gs , then we &apos;re going to start making a couple of c@@ ash ste@@ am , and we &apos;ll get up again .
and this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly app@@ lic@@ ated .
if you pick it up somewhere , it takes it all the time .
the average reser@@ ve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the course of time , they can re@@ act to others .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , these ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , you &apos;ve got to replace it with service electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ chemical chemistry .
and we can turn out to this big battery two-@@ milli@@ seconds , and we can pull it out .
and again , you can see what huge speed of steps there is .
and the message is , well , we have to dis@@ miss these ro@@ tat@@ -@@ related mas@@ ses , if we sort of spend our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 , and so on , if we want to reach it all .
we then have to exp@@ and our blu@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art capac@@ i@@ ties on the grid .
it &apos;s simple , it &apos;s just , the power plant is going to run around to keep the frequ@@ ency .
yes , this is a big debate at the moment , because of the coal force , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or ga@@ ins fi@@ ber , because it doesn &apos;t .
and we &apos;re just trying to point out that you can break out the capac@@ i@@ ties , the mu@@ ze@@ -@@ scale capac@@ i@@ ties , by making electro@@ chemical memory into the grid .
now , unfortunately , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies that are happening .
and the people who always come and look at our time at the time , and look at our time , they appear to appear
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a piece of time up there .
and many discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years , like the discussion i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years had photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics , for example .
it &apos;s not a bol@@ ttle , a child &apos;s game , we &apos;ve come up with it all , it &apos;s never going to calcu@@ date .
we &apos;ve got 30 gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in germany today .
this is pre@@ for@@ est@@ ing .
and i &apos;m just going to end up in the next 30 years that we &apos;ll have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical stor@@ es all over the world .
it &apos;s very simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to happen .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of impli@@ cations and argu@@ ments .
and the beauty is , i &apos;ve been thinking about this now in the last two years , that the scientist is on my page .
we have now received over 10 million marketing projects , including 10@@ -@@ me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t-@@ battery battery now , to cut ger@@ man networks .
this is going to happen in the next apri@@ l next .
so one of the things that you notice there is that there is a change , and it &apos;s only due to the idea , a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able is right now .
and if you &apos;ve got a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , it &apos;s like an au@@ ti@@ le system .
so far , in discus@@ sions , these insu@@ lan@@ ters , who are making au@@ t@@ als , they have a little bit of their own web , and they have nothing to do with our bra@@ x and things .
the question , though , is quite simple when you &apos;re completely independent of any fossil or national energy for@@ it@@ age that somewhere in the world will be bo@@ wed somewhere in the world , and you &apos;re being killed to them , you &apos;re an island .
and then they just use what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind where they live .
and this is kind of a bit of our vision of a reas@@ on@@ able energy supply , and i &apos;m also gr@@ ate@@ ful to cra@@ d@@ le that you &apos;ve said to use solar energy .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and this is what we &apos;re doing , including the talk of pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , that you can again be a collective , and use solar energy , and here &apos;s a little bit together .
and sure , i just want to encoura@@ ge you , in the sense that you can be quie@@ t a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough in this , but i think it will be .
thanks very much .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n the los angeles times , one day passed through the streets at the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pathy , ro@@ o , hom@@ eless , who played on a vi@@ o@@ lin , who only had two str@@ ands .
many of you will know the story , because from ste@@ ve article , a book was born , with robert dow@@ ney j@@ uni@@ or as steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel psychiat@@ ony a@@ wait , the most conf@@ used , who studied the je@@ il@@ ed conser@@ v@@ atory , and his promis@@ ing career had been taken early by his par@@ an@@ o@@ id schizophren@@ ia .
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ il@@ iel , who had a high break@@ down , and 30 years later , he lived as hom@@ eless in the streets of sk@@ id row at the center of los angeles .
i re@@ com@@ men@@ d you all to read ste@@ al book or watch the movie , so that it was not just understanding the wonderful connec@@ te@@ dness , which is between these two men , but also how the music helped these connections , and how she ended up with the instrument , if this pu@@ b allows us to get the person &apos;s seat , na@@ than@@ iel away away from the street .
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , and i met hall .
he just heard a dem@@ o of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sen@@ row , and he came up to the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very tough and rich note about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , and how the do@@ d@@ gers would never create it to the photographs of the world , and all of this because of the da@@ y@@ ful accor@@ d of the first po@@ ll of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth vot@@ es .
we went to talk about music , and a couple of days later , i got an email , and the fact that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in me for me , that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in
i have to mention that na@@ than@@ iel re@@ vie@@ wed a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric sho@@ cks and with th@@ or@@ a@@ ine and hand@@ sha@@ kes , a trau@@ ma that his whole life was pur@@ ch@@ asing him .
as a con@@ sequence of that , he &apos;s particularly sus@@ pi@@ cious for these schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases , which sometimes is so bad , sometimes it &apos;s so bad , and he continu@@ es to go out into the streets of sk@@ id row , always this hor@@ ror and vie@@ w-@@ quality of his own spirit .
and in the same way , na@@ than@@ iel , na@@ than@@ iel , when we first started working with our first school hour in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , and he had started hall , and he had lost this fir@@ sth@@ man in his eyes , and he was completely lost .
he was talking about invisible mon@@ es and smo@@ ke , and how he wanted to po@@ ison him in the sleep .
i was afraid , not a little bit about , but i was afraid that i could lose it in some of his circum@@ stances , and that i could destro@@ y him to destro@@ y his relationship to the diet , when i started talking about clay and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ via and other exciting forms of the conduc@@ tor of di@@ tors .
so , i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s in@@ o@@ in@@ te .
and while i played , i noticed that na@@ th@@ ani@@ l &apos;s eyes was going to be a completely different change .
it was as if he was under the influence of a invisible biolog@@ ist , a chemical reaction whose cat@@ aly@@ st was my play .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ ille man@@ ic an@@ or@@ n affec@@ tes himself , in a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy .
and like through a mira@@ cle , he took his diet , and she started playing some ex@@ clu@@ sions of vi@@ in@@ in@@ -@@ contra@@ ct , and then she asked me to finish her to finish her : men@@ del@@ s@@ son , t@@ é@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ i , si@@ li@@ li@@ us .
we then started talking about music , from b@@ ach about bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner and all the other bs , from bar@@ to@@ k k to es@@ -@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ ons .
and i realized that he had not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia knowledge about music , but she also connected it to a close personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and understanding that i knew otherwise about my colleagues in phil@@ harmon@@ y of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , it was made out of this par@@ an@@ o@@ id , conf@@ used man , who was still travel@@ ed by the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ vely , educ@@ ated , exc@@ ell@@ ent musi@@ cian in ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard &apos;s trained musi@@ cians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music means psycho@@ -@@ health health .
because the music allows him to form its thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions with help of imagination and creativity in a very real way .
and so he &apos;s cat@@ ching up his ev@@ al@@ u@@ ating conditions .
i understood that , in fact , that &apos;s the essen@@ ce of art .
and that &apos;s why we make music : so that we do something that in all of us , deep inside us , in our emotions , through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , can shape through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that information is going on all of us , and it &apos;s moving , and it &apos;s going to happen and it &apos;s killing us .
what na@@ than@@ iel did , he brought him back into a community of friends in a community of friends .
the em@@ bed@@ ding power of music brought it back into a family of musi@@ cians who understood him , who recogni@@ zed his talent and his r@@ esses .
and i &apos;m always going to draw up with na@@ than@@ iel music , whether in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , or sk@@ id row , and sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me of why i became a musi@@ cian .
thanks very much .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : อ@@ .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i want to play something that i absolutely sus@@ pe@@ ct the c@@ elli@@ st .
i hope you &apos;ll for@@ give me .
so , i &apos;ve been a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two of them .
and this first one , this was more like a passionate m@@ eller .
it was a beautiful fish , it was cre@@ am@@ y , good consi@@ stent , it was a she@@ er on the men@@ u .
what a fish like .
even better , it was exp@@ and@@ ed in a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture for the most appropriate standards of sustain@@ ability .
so you could feel to sell it up to sell .
i had a relationship with a couple of months with this beauty .
one day , the head of the company called up , and i wonder@@ ed , if i could finish on one event about the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this incredible problem has become for our che@@ fs , how do we stop fish on our stor@@ es ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ umin@@ ated the ocean as we &apos;ve be@@ aten the ic@@ s of the
it &apos;s hard to over@@ come the destruction .
90 percent of the great fish that we love , the tun@@ a , the he@@ ater , the pi@@ ck@@ ens , the sin@@ ks , heavy fish , they &apos;re collap@@ sed .
it &apos;s almost nothing more .
so it may be , or fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed a@@ qu@@ ak@@ y , fis@@ titude , a part of our future .
a lot of argu@@ ments about it . fis@@ und@@ y-@@ related pollu@@ tan@@ ts , the environment , most of them , are , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , take tun@@ a . it &apos;s a big deal .
he &apos;s got a fif@@ l@@ u@@ ration of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds of mal@@ fish requi@@ red so you get a po@@ und of a po@@ und .
not very aff@@ ord@@ able .
don &apos;t taste very well either .
so , finally , here was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support her support .
the day before that event , i called up the head of public labor for the company .
we &apos;re going to call him no@@ is@@ y .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous enough to grow so far away in the ocean that you &apos;re not pollu@@ ted to the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far away that the waste of our fish is distribu@@ ted , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
and then he sat up saying , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is an 18@@ 5 fe@@ e@@ ge of 2.@@ 5 , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best people in the industry . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great , great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one ? what fe@@ e@@ ds you ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . i got up .
and i was in the bed that night , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so , i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t lau@@ gh .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask it .
now , i was making a bunch of people in the company , nobody could give me a de@@ cent answer , and i finally had an ad@@ cent bi@@ ologists &apos; question .
we also don &apos;t call him a voice .
&quot; don , &quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some fishing me@@ bes , and then he said chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
and i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ our , rain , dri@@ gh@@ ted and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , how much percent of ear@@ ners is chicken ? &quot;
in the pres@@ ence of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t listen , what &apos;s a sustainable thing to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long post in the dis@@ section , and he said , &quot; there is too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i fell out of this fish .
no , it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a more confi@@ dent and a familiar man .
this is me , actually .
no , i actually confi@@ dent@@ ally lo@@ cked from this fish , because , i swe@@ ar to god , the fish of fish atta@@ ched to chicken after that conversation .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way , the way in which you learn the better you learn your fish , you don &apos;t love the fish anymore .
i first ate him in a restaurant in sou@@ in in sou@@ in .
there was a belo@@ ved journalist who had talked about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of wired us to s@@ ale .
he came on the table with a bright , almost rob@@ ber@@ ing white color .
the che@@ f had coo@@ ked it .
keep twice twice .
and ama@@ z@@ ingly , he was still more deli@@ cious .
who can attra@@ ct a fish so well after it &apos;s su@@ g@@ ged ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he doesn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and it &apos;s not a che@@ f . at least in the way that they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
this is a fish up in the south south corner of spa@@ in .
it &apos;s near the m@@ ess of the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ al@@ r .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm in ar@@ gent@@ ina was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans .
they were growing meat c@@ attle on what they were basically we@@ t@@ lands .
they did this by de@@ fle@@ cting the land .
and they built these complicated results of chan@@ n@@ els , and they dro@@ pped water out of land and out into the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make it , it wasn &apos;t econom@@ ically .
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around , which is a lot of birds for this place .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company bought the country in 198@@ 2 .
what did they do ?
they &apos;ve got the flow of water around the water .
and they literally put out the le@@ il@@ er .
so instead of breaking the water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pull the water back back .
they fle@@ w the chan@@ n@@ els .
they created a 1@@ 1,000 ac@@ r@@ ation of fish -- bar@@ ely , sou@@ red , gar@@ n@@ els , a@@ al -- and they had mi@@ gu@@ el , and his company had completely rever@@ sed the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical dec@@ line .
the farm is un@@ belie@@ vable .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
she star@@ es out to the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and all you see is the ab@@ und@@ ant chan@@ n@@ els and those den@@ sity , which is sp@@ ill@@ y mar@@ ch .
i haven &apos;t been a long time ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin , and a piece of &quot; cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to kitchen . &quot;
okay ? so we were and f@@ ought with the we@@ t@@ lands , and i f@@ ought and swi@@ mming and swi@@ mming , and i got bag@@ h to my k@@ ne@@ l , and mi@@ gu@@ el , and mi@@ gu@@ el , i &apos;m going to give you a biology lec@@ ture .
and this is a rare contr@@ ary .
now , he mentioned the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
and here , he &apos;s looking at a pattern of trees that re@@ minds him to the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
and it turns out mi@@ gu@@ el most of his career has spent the most part of his career in mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
i wonder@@ ed him how he got to such a fish of fish .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish . &quot;
i &apos;m an exper@@ t for rela@@ tions . &quot;
and then it wal@@ ks , and it bur@@ ns in more terms of inse@@ ct birds and al@@ ga@@ e and strange water plants .
and just don &apos;t get me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community was un@@ pl@@ ug@@ ged , so it was in the same way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love with it .
and my head was we@@ ak about this sort of de@@ cent piece of deli@@ cious fish i had at the end of the day .
so i po@@ pped it up . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how is it that your fish ta@@ stes so well ? &quot;
he poin@@ ted on the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat your fish ?
what is the sal@@ acy of food ? &quot;
well , he continu@@ es to tell me that there is such a rich system that the fish are eating , what they &apos;re going to eat in the wild .
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , that is what &apos;s fe@@ eding the fish .
the system is so healthy ; it &apos;s completely self-@@ susta@@ ined .
there is no food .
everyone &apos;s heard by a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her animals ?
later a day later , i would go around this corner with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place , which seems to be so natural , &quot; different than every farm i &apos;ve ever had was , &quot; how do you con@@ v@@ ance ? &quot;
at that moment , it was as though a film director had a shif@@ ting shift .
and we swi@@ t@@ ched around the corner , and we put it on the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pin@@ kers fl@@ amin@@ gos , a very literally p@@ eller car@@ pet , as far as the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your tu@@ es , p@@ ink .
they &apos;re su@@ mm@@ ed . &quot;
di@@ vor@@ ce ? i was completely conf@@ used .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t make you a fish ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to the birds .
well , last year , there were 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different ways .
it &apos;s the biggest , and one of the most important private a@@ ste@@ ments in europe today has become all over europe .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is a good bird , not the last you want you to have on a fish of fish ? &quot;
he &apos;s sha@@ king his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to build complexity , not inten@@ se .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
the fl@@ am@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the pur@@ pi@@ bs eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
so the br@@ ord is the better of the bel@@ ly better . &quot;
all right , let &apos;s re@@ think this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her animals and a farm that descri@@ bes her success on the health of its predat@@ ors .
it &apos;s also a bird reser@@ ve , but it &apos;s also a bird reser@@ ve .
oh , and by the way , this fl@@ amin@@ gos is not even supposed to be there .
they went away in a city about 2@@ 40 miles , where the exchange of soil is better for the nest .
they fly 2,000 miles to the farm every single morning .
and they fly 2@@ 40 miles away every single night .
they do this because they can track the world &apos;s memor@@ ed white line in a@@ 9@@ 2 .
it &apos;s serious .
i was introduced by a sort of a class of penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , fly 2@@ 40 miles up to the farm and fly them back 2@@ 40 miles away at night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , like i just had a song by whit@@ ney hou@@ ston ci@@ ston .
he said , &quot; no . you do this because it &apos;s better to eat . &quot;
i didn &apos;t write the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , the deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like fish of fish . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t
it &apos;s this sing@@ ing , sel@@ co@@ sted taste .
i &apos;m almost never co@@ vering it .
and yet , when i tried them in southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t s@@ hr@@ ink it at all to fish skin at all .
she che@@ cked c@@ ute and in the same way that you would take a bi@@ te from the ocean .
i mentioned this to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he was kid@@ ding .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ch@@ ie .
it &apos;s the last failure before there &apos;s something in the body .
it has evolved throughout evolutionary evolution to look at ine@@ repar@@ ance . &quot;
and then he said to himself , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any in@@ fu@@ its . &quot;
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her fish , a farm that con@@ tains its success , depen@@ ding on their predat@@ ors , depen@@ ding on their predat@@ ors .
and then i realized , if he tells me , a farm that doesn &apos;t have any accident , it uses enormous , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes from the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ to@@ vi@@ r .
it &apos;s a river that causes all the things that cause all those things , and they tend to lead them to lead , chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , waste of g@@ ap@@ s , of g@@ ap@@ s .
and when it f@@ ought through the system , and it leaves that water , it &apos;s clean than how it comes out .
the system is so healthy ; it cle@@ ans the water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her animals , not just a farm that shows her success on the health of its predat@@ ors , but a farm that is literally a water process@@ ing plant , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water blo@@ ws out , it &apos;s going to fall out in the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and i take it too , because this love story , as roman@@ tic as usual , is also obje@@ ctive .
one might say that she is a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we talk about bar@@ ry or meat .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of one , in fact , in the food of food
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not a tou@@ cher ; we &apos;re enjo@@ ying . we &apos;re lo@@ ad@@ y .
we love markets . we love small family programs . we talk about local food . we eat bi@@ o .
and if you say that these are things that are going to be good food , someone somewhere goes up and says , &quot; hey guys , i love pin@@ ke fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be a wonderful thing ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just to feed .
a billion people are going to star@@ ve today .
a billion -- this is more than ever before -- due to cr@@ as@@ less ine@@ quali@@ ties in the distribution , not of total production .
well , i don &apos;t like that question because they &apos;ve had the lo@@ gic of our food system over the last 50 years .
s@@ uns@@ h@@ hing cro@@ ps to plant fe@@ e@@ ds , p@@ ap@@ g@@ h@@ ers to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all of the time , the agri@@ cultural industry has just wonder@@ ed , &quot; if we feed more people che@@ aper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the rule . it was the business plan of the american agriculture .
we should call it what it is , a corpo@@ rate buil@@ ding , a cre@@ ature which is rapi@@ dly active , which is rapi@@ dly organic capital , that gives you that production .
this is not a cre@@ ature , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our cre@@ ator cham@@ ber is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not based on pre@@ vent@@ ing resources , but because of the lack of resources .
not by the lat@@ est hi@@ d@@ lock and tra@@ c@@ tu@@ al innovation , but through ferti@@ li@@ ble land , not by pu@@ mp , but through fresh water , not through cha@@ in@@ dar@@ s , but through fore@@ sts , not by the mar@@ ches , but through fore@@ sts , not by fishing ves@@ ings and we@@ ats , but through fish in the ocean .
you &apos;re going to feed the world ?
so , let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that will em@@ power every community to feed itself ?
in order to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ cultural model model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are o@@ b@@ an , and it never produ@@ ces something really good for food .
now , let &apos;s look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
and this is the equivalent that goes back to two billion years of labor .
look at mi@@ gu@@ el chen , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
businesses that are not worl@@ ding for themselves , businesses that are not worl@@ ding rather than need , businesses that are going to grow up , that are inten@@ sive rather than just inten@@ sive , farmers that are not only prof@@ it@@ ant , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are experts , they &apos;re also experts .
and if i &apos;m really honest , it &apos;s a better che@@ am than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good fo@@ ods , it will be deli@@ cious .
so thank you .
now , if i want to answer you one thing today is that the whole data of data that we consu@@ me are larger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ flow , i want you to think about how we can use information so that it can take patterns , and we can recognize trends that otherwise couldn &apos;t be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical ju@@ pping of texas after age .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is that i can filter on a certain state of death , let &apos;s say acci@@ dents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it available .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of the middle here , people are the most active , and they &apos;re more subje@@ ctive over here .
we can go out a step further , and then we reduce the data , and then we see that cy@@ cular disease and cancer are the usual sus@@ pe@@ cts , but not for everybody .
now , if we go further to age , we say , 40 years or yo@@ unger , we find that acci@@ dents will even be the main thing about which people should be worried about .
and who is looking at the research that this is particularly true to men .
so , what you can see is that the view of information and data is really remin@@ ded to swim in a lifetime of information in this way .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not even content itself ?
so what we have here is the cover of every single thing that we &apos;ve ever been photograph@@ ed here , which has ever been
it &apos;s all over here . it &apos;s all over online .
you can test it after my talk in your din@@ ers .
pi@@ ck@@ t , they can spli@@ t into a decade .
you can spli@@ t into a certain year .
you can jump directly to a particular out@@ come .
now , when i look here , i look at the ath@@ le@@ tes that appear and the spor@@ ts of spor@@ ts .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i click on what lan@@ ce arm@@ strong said to me about what lan@@ ce arm@@ strong is saying .
now , if i want to get a bigger over@@ view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with bi@@ kes ? &quot;
so i go back a step back , and i &apos;ll give you a step .
now i &apos;m watching gre@@ g le@@ mond .
and so you get an idea of that , that when you look at these kinds of information , you get d@@ ressed , and you zo@@ om , you zo@@ om out , you zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t just look at or clean up .
you do something that is actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it will change the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit further with something a little bit crazy .
and what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve taken every single wiki@@ po@@ t and distribu@@ ted it on a piece of sum@@ mary .
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a very short over@@ view , and a symbol of the area that comes out of it .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the popular english tal@@ di@@ a@@ tives .
but even in that limited view , we can do a whole bunch of things .
immediately , we have a gli@@ mp@@ se of the top@@ ics that are at wikipedia at the present .
i &apos;m going to choose the govern@@ ance of government .
now , after i cho@@ se the government , i recogni@@ zed that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ at@@ tion@@ ies , which most of us are known to be &quot; people of the year &quot; are &quot; people of the year .
this is really important , because this is an insi@@ ght that doesn &apos;t have a single wiki@@ pe@@ er .
it &apos;s only to realize when you go back and look back at the whole thing .
in addition to one of these sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can go into the study of time magazine in the study of the year , and all of them see together .
now , if i look at all of these people , i realize that the majority of them are government offi@@ cial , some of them come from science -- some , even less , come out of the economy . here &apos;s my bo@@ ss . and one comes out of music .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
and so we can jump around and look at all the ted w@@ inn@@ ers .
you can see , we &apos;re sur@@ fing the network the first time it &apos;s actually a network , not just from page to side , but much abstra@@ ct .
and so , i want to show you what other surprise might be .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website here .
pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a mobile brow@@ ser , but you can look at web sites -- and we bring this zo@@ om@@ -@@ technology to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and i &apos;ll jump directly to a specific bi@@ ction .
and that &apos;s important because you just look at web sites in this way , and you can look at the web course in the same way that you can see the whole kind of internet course .
so i can just zo@@ om in in a certain field in my field .
this is the state of the entire demon@@ stration that i thought i had to hold up here .
and i can kind of get back to everything i &apos;ve looked at today , right back .
and , if i go back a step again and look at everything , i can look at my course , maybe in my search past , and here i &apos;m looking for &apos; ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic , i &apos;m looking for blo@@ cking here , or here to live lab@@ s pi@@ ck@@ ed here .
and from here , i can go into the page and pull it back up .
it &apos;s a metaphor that always gets used again , and every time it does it , it makes the whole picture larger than the sum of the data .
at the moment , in this world , we think that data is a ti@@ mel@@ ine .
we &apos;re talking about the flow of information ab@@ und@@ ance .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; dro@@ w@@ ning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation down and put the internet on its head , so that instead of going from one to the other , we begin to go from many things too many things , and see patterns that would otherwise have been wrong ?
and if we can do that , then these are going to be a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
and , rather than just moving into information , we can get knowledge out of it .
and if we know that we may be able to pull even more wisdom out of it .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to hear . thank you .
i grew up with a com@@ mu@@ tion of science fi@@ ction .
i went to school with the bus to school every day , a day per hour .
and my nose always stuck in a book , a science fi@@ ction book , which brought my thoughts into other worl@@ ds , and i was a not@@ ori@@ ously gr@@ ate@@ ful in my clo@@ sing , unbe@@ at@@ u@@ ous curi@@ osity .
these curi@@ osity also showed me that when i wasn &apos;t in school , by the time i wasn &apos;t in high school , migr@@ ated and sam@@ ples , fro@@ gs and sna@@ gs and bu@@ gs and bu@@ gs and po@@ ch@@ water and po@@ ch@@ water , everything brought home home and looked under the microscop@@ e .
i &apos;ve been a completely science , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world , and to capture the limit@@ ations of the potential .
and my love of science fi@@ ction appe@@ ared in my neighborhood , because back in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ w to the moon , and we explor@@ ed the deep ocean .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living room with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never could have imag@@ ined .
now , this may seem well adap@@ ted to the science fi@@ ction .
and i was a perfor@@ mer .
i &apos;ve been able to draw . i could paint .
and since it wasn &apos;t video games , nor these hyper@@ -@@ gener@@ ated videos with computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated films in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we all had to . when we gave a book as children , we took the descri@@ ption of the auth@@ or , and we proje@@ cted it on the screen in our minds .
my response to that was drawing , drawing by ali@@ ens , ali@@ ens worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ ec@@ raft and everything like that .
in grade education , i was given all the time from the teachers , like i was hi@@ ding back in the text@@ book .
creativity had to be a kind of out .
and something happened about that . what i was fascin@@ ated about jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ aus shows was the idea of an un@@ known world on earth itself .
now , i &apos;m never going to do a neu@@ tra@@ l world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p , and it seemed rather un@@ likely .
but here , i had a world that i actually could walk out here on earth , and it was as fascinating and ex@@ o@@ tic as all of what i had imag@@ ined when i was reading these books .
so , i decided , when i was 15 , i decided to become a di@@ ver .
the only problem with this is that i lived in a small village in canada , a 3,000 kilometers away from the ne@@ west ocean .
i wasn &apos;t going to dis@@ coura@@ ge from that .
i jo@@ ined my father until he finally had a live school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ed , right on the other side of the bor@@ der where we lived .
i made my di@@ ve in a pool of y@@ m@@ ca in the winter of the winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i just got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years that i &apos;ve been talking about , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of it in di@@ rt bo@@ ats .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of deep ocean , even in the flat ocean , is so rich of fascinating life , how we can &apos;t possibly imagine .
nature &apos;s imagination doesn &apos;t know limit@@ s , as op@@ posed to our own , gra@@ di@@ di@@ cal human imagination .
until for days today , i feel profound about what i see on my di@@ ve tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory
and my love to the ocean is holding on the ocean with the same inten@@ sity as well as ever .
so , when i looked at a prof@@ ession as a prof@@ ession , it was the film making .
and that seemed the best way to tell my inner effort to tell stories , to create images , to make pictures .
as a kid , i dre@@ w com@@ ic books , and this is what i draw .
so films of the path were to bring pictures and images and stories . this is what ended up being .
of course , the stories i looked at from the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction zone : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ges , &quot; i was able to make my interests for the under@@ water world , and to bridge with the film@@ making .
so , i had my two passi@@ ons .
something interesting happened at &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid water cre@@ ature -- we would click on computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ation , c@@ g , back .
and what we came up with was the first computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated software of software that had ever been seen in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t take any money , exactly he played his production cost , but i realized something fascinating : the audience in the world was like h@@ yp@@ no@@ tics from the magic , which was out of it .
according to ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law , there are no advanced technology and ma@@ gi@@ l dis@@ plays on each other .
and so they saw something ma@@ gical .
and i thought that was terri@@ bly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s going to have to be em@@ bed@@ ded into the movie art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next movie , even further .
along along , we created the guy out of liquid metal , and it depen@@ ded on it all over the way that this effect would happen .
and it worked . again , we created something ma@@ gical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we played a little bit more money with the movie .
so , from these two experiences , a whole new world has achie@@ ved , a whole new world of creativity for film .
so i started a company along with my good friend ken win@@ ston , who at that time was the best ma@@ ke@@ -@@ step designer , who was the best ma@@ ke@@ -@@ step designer . it was called digital do@@ main .
and the main idea of this company was to cross the phase of resol@@ ution with op@@ tical prin@@ ters , and start to go through digital appli@@ cations and start to start with digital produ@@ ctions .
and we did that , and we got a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
but in the mid@@ - &apos; 9@@ 0s , we announ@@ ced that we had in the cre@@ ators and the mirror design -- which we actually started doing the company -- at the end of time .
i had written this piece of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which was supposed to fold up the sc@@ or@@ es in visual effects and computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects in all new al@@ ths , with real human human characters that were made by c@@ g , and the main fig@@ ures should be all c@@ g . and the rest of the world should be c@@ g .
but the cat@@ h@@ board was very quick to get back , and the people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t going to be pro@@ li@@ und@@ ly able to do it .
so i put this together , and i made this other movie about the big ship that goes on .
i sold this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ o on a ship , &quot; and it became a love film , ar@@ c film , a passionate movie .
but i actually wanted to end up in secret to the real after@@ noon of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that , but it didn &apos;t .
but i convinced them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to get to the w@@ ass . we &apos;re going to film the real w@@ ass .
we &apos;re going to show it in the recor@@ ding sequence of the film .
this is hu@@ gely important . it &apos;s a good pay for marketing . &quot;
and i ad@@ mit@@ ted them to fund an expedi@@ tion .
sounds crazy . but this is going back back to the fact that your imagination can create reality .
we actually created a reality , actually , six months later that i found myself in an russi@@ an di@@ ve boat , four kilometers away from the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , and i looked at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic by a bu@@ ll@@ le eye .
this was not a movie , no h@@ d , that was real .
so , that really ble@@ w me up .
and the prepar@@ ation of prepar@@ ation was enormous , and we had to build c@@ ameras and cloud and things like that .
and i noticed how there was a lot of these deep@@ -@@ si@@ zed spaces , a space stat@@ ement .
well , they were also highly competi@@ tive and allowed to take more expensive planning .
you go into these cap@@ su@@ le , you &apos;re flo@@ ating into these dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environments , where there is no hope for res@@ cu@@ e , if you &apos;re not making it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science fi@@ ction film .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obs@@ essed with explor@@ ing the deep se@@ as .
in addition to the part of curi@@ osity and science , it was all . it was all . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure ; it was curi@@ osity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood to hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature that we could make a visual effect for , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside of the window .
now , for some of the expedi@@ tions , i &apos;ve seen life in ther@@ mal@@ ards , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that have never seen before , and the science , at the moment , when we saw it , no words at the time when we saw it even no words .
so that &apos;s what i was going to do right now , and i wanted more .
and so i got a little bit unusual choice .
after the success of ti@@ tan@@ ic , i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my prime prof@@ ession as a film@@ maker in hollywood , and it &apos;s going to be a long time resear@@ cher .
and then we started , we came up with &quot; bis@@ mar@@ ck , &quot; and we explor@@ ed them with robo@@ tic experiences .
we re@@ turned back to the ti@@ tan@@ ic of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
we took small robots that we &apos;d built that had a fi@@ ber@@ glass c@@ able .
our inten@@ tion was to wra@@ p in and see the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one &apos;s ever had the inside of the de@@ ck . you didn &apos;t have a means to do it , so we evolved technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting there , on the de@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a di@@ ve boat , and i &apos;m going to see you , you know , these pil@@ ors here , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little robo@@ tic experience through the tra@@ cks of the ship .
i actually do it , but i think my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physi@@ cally within the board of the ti@@ tan@@ ic of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
this was the most powerful shape of a d@@ é@@ j@@ i v@@ u that i had ever experienced , because before i left around a corner , i knew what was going on in the light of the vehicle , because i &apos;d been to the movie of the car , because i &apos;d finished reading the movie .
and the combin@@ ed part was a pre@@ cise copy of the blu@@ els of the ship .
so , this was a very curious experience .
and she made me realize this tele@@ pres@@ entation experience that you use such robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars , and therefore your consciousness in the vehicle can be placed into the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really extremely profound , really profound .
and perhaps a little bit about what might happen in a few decades if you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to explore something or to do things , or to do things , in all different post-@@ security consumption , which i can think of as a science fi@@ ction .
and after these expedi@@ tions , we started to really appreci@@ ate what we &apos;d seen down there , for example , these deep@@ -@@ sea inter@@ rup@@ tors , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are sort of ali@@ ir@@ als , but here &apos;s where we &apos;re going on .
they are living with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
it &apos;s not exi@@ sting in a sun@@ light system , as we &apos;re doing .
and this is what you &apos;re seeing animals right next to a 500 degrees centi@@ grade , and they can survive there .
and at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was again the science fi@@ ction influ@@ enced from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in the space and talking to nasa , and they &apos;re going to plan real space mis@@ sions , and they &apos;re going to go to russi@@ the right space mis@@ sions . they go to russi@@ a , from the mission , the bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ co@@ l , all over and on , fly to the global space station and take our three-@@ dimensional camera station .
and that was fascinating .
but i ended up in the end that i took worl@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned scientists with us in the ocean .
i took them up with me , and i put them down to the world , astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ en@@ ans , modern scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so they could take sam@@ ples , and they could test the instru@@ ments and so on .
we went to docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but we actually did science , and we actually talked about space , and space science .
so the circle between my existence as a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction was , at the time as a child , and the imple@@ ment@@ ation was in the reality .
i &apos;ve learned a lot of research during the course of this research journey .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve got to think that a director has to be able to be a leader , like a ship , or something .
but i didn &apos;t really understand a lot about leadership before i enter@@ ed these expedi@@ tions .
because at some point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ? &quot;
why do i do that ? what is it ? &quot;
these stupid films aren &apos;t hir@@ ing us with money .
we &apos;re going to play the production costs . it &apos;s not a lan@@ e .
everybody thinks i was walking between ti@@ tan@@ ic and a@@ vat@@ ar , and there would have been a ca@@ pe somewhere on a beach .
i &apos;ve made all these films , these docum@@ ent@@ ary films , for a very small audience .
no sh@@ ame , no honor , no money . what are you going to do ?
you &apos;re going to be asking it for the task to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment that you have . you &apos;re using it to be the same thing , because of the curious relationship that happens when a small group of people are educ@@ ating a team .
because we &apos;ve made all this with just 10 to 12 people working on the years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been two to three months back in la@@ kes in la@@ kes in la@@ kes .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the a@@ partment that you have in front of each other , because you &apos;ve ac@@ qui@@ red a task that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
when you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fi@@ ber glass , the m@@ all wave , and the whole technology , the whole technology , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of human performance , when you &apos;re working on la@@ kes , you can just not explain the other thing . it &apos;s like with poli@@ ce@@ men or soldiers who have come through something and know that they can never explain anybody .
there is a connection , a lin@@ ear respect .
so when i came back to make my next movie &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply exactly the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and it deser@@ ves in the back train .
that &apos;s what the dynam@@ ics really changed .
so , i went back with a small team on un@@ known ter@@ rain , and we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new techni@@ que that had not yet exi@@ sted before .
it &apos;s extremely exciting .
it &apos;s a tremendous challenge .
and we &apos;ve been to a right family for four and a half years old .
and so my way to make films changed , it changed .
there were people who said we had really well studied this ocean state and transpor@@ ted the planet p@@ and@@ or@@ a .
and to me , it was more like a sort of a way to do my job , the actual process that changed itself .
so , what are we going to close out of this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think the first point , i think , is curi@@ osity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force that can even make a reality .
and your team &apos;s wisdom is more important than all of the l@@ or@@ fs of the world .
i &apos;ll come up with young film@@ makers who say , &quot; give me an ad@@ vice , how i can do something . &quot;
and i say , &quot; de@@ fau@@ lt you , you don &apos;t .
they have others for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t feed yourself , don &apos;t get a risk on you . &quot;
nasa wrote such a final sentence : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , in a context , fail needs to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a tru@@ pe of trust there .
no important deal , the innovation requi@@ red , it was suff@@ i@@ cient without a risk .
you &apos;ve got to be willing to take those risks up .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you on the way : fail@@ ers is an alternative , but fear is an alternative , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and it may surprise you something because my ful@@ l-@@ time effort at the foundation main@@ ly invol@@ ves vac@@ cin@@ es and see@@ ds to allow the things that we inv@@ ent and choose to deliver the poor@@ est two-@@ billion billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for those people , in fact , even more important than any other planet on the planet .
climate re@@ vel@@ ation means that your sa@@ ws will not grow over many years . it &apos;s too much rain or too small . the things are going to change the way it can &apos;t even change its fra@@ gi@@ le environment .
that leads to hunger . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
also , the energy ri@@ pe is very important for them .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of one thing , it would be energy , it would be energy at far most more effective .
well , the energy ri@@ me has fallen over time .
in fact , the advanced society is pro@@ gr@@ ession in energy progress .
the co@@ ot@@ ing evolution is driving the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a vast fall in carbon volu@@ me , and therefore we have cool@@ ed , air condi@@ tion@@ ers , we can make modern materials and so many things do .
so we are in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce price -- let &apos;s cut the price -- let &apos;s hit on a new bar@@ ner , and this dam@@ ner is wra@@ pped by co2 .
carbon warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they divi@@ de this massive co2 , which is growing to temperature , and they have some very negative impli@@ cations . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indi@@ cation that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ada@@ pt to the point that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t fit out the change , and therefore they collapse whole systems .
well , the ex@@ act cor@@ relation between a co2 rise , and it has resul@@ ted temper@@ atures of temperature , and where there are other impli@@ cations , there are some un@@ belie@@ vable , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ir@@ rational about how bad they are going to follow , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i wonder@@ ed the top@@ -@@ scientist several times , &quot; do we really have to get down to zero ?
not half a quar@@ ter or a quar@@ ter ? &quot;
and the answer is : until we get near zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a 3@@ .@@ 0-@@ foot tru@@ ck that has to pull under a three-@@ meter ri@@ ck , and you can sort of squ@@ ee@@ ze it in front of it .
this is going to be very far down here , down to zero .
well , we &apos;ve measu@@ red a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons of tons .
every americans about 20 tons : people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about 5 tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes that pull it down to zero .
it &apos;s always gone out .
just different economic changes have been affec@@ ted it , and we need to go from rapi@@ dly to reduce the rise and to reduce a price to zero .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors . a little bit multi@@ pli@@ cation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get towards zero , and that will dep@@ end on the number of people , from the service that everybody else uses on average , the average energy for every service , and the co2 , which is em@@ it@@ ted per source of energy .
so let &apos;s just look at every factor and think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers needs to get very close to zero .
now this is the fundamental al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s get through it .
first of all , we have population .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live today .
and it jo@@ thers up to nine billion . it &apos;s about to move to 9 billion .
if we succe@@ ed very successful with new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care and re@@ production medicine , we could reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we see a dec@@ line of 1.@@ 3 .
the second one is the services that we use .
that inclu@@ des everything , the food that we eat , clo@@ th@@ es , television , he@@ els .
that &apos;s very good stuff and poverty redu@@ ction is to make these services acc@@ essi@@ ble almost every part of the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is going on .
in the rich world , in the top billion , we may be able to get away and use less use , but on average , this number will increase every year , and it &apos;s more than dou@@ bled , the number of services that are em@@ bed@@ ded to be provi@@ ded to each person .
here we see a very fundamental service . is there your home light so that you can read your home@@ work ?
and these students , they don &apos;t have it , so they go out and they read their school tas@@ ks under the street .
now , in effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , the e , the energy per service , there are well good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different amo@@ ings in the light sector , through other kinds of other practic@@ es , there are a lot of services , there are many services , the energy supply of some individual services , there are at 90 percent redu@@ ction .
in other services , like making ferti@@ li@@ tions , 10@@ 5 : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 5 : 1.@@ 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- &amp; lt ; d &amp; amp ; d &amp; amp ; d &amp; amp ; d &amp; amp ; / em &amp; amp ; / em &amp; gt ;
in a variety of times , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , maybe maybe we &apos;ll reduce a factor of a factor three or maybe even a factor six .
but with the first three fac@@ tors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion tons of the last 13 tons , and that &apos;s simply not like all of it .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- this is the amount of co2 that &apos;s em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit .
it turns out the question is whether you can get it to zero .
if you burn char@@ coal , no .
if you give natural gas , no one .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity is em@@ it@@ ted today , except rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear energi@@ es .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy mira@@ cles .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
and the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the p@@ c is a mira@@ cle .
the internet and the service is a mira@@ cle .
the people here have contribu@@ ted to the development of many of these wonder@@ s .
and typically , there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a particular date .
usually , you just only get close and some people , some don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to be fine , and we get a mira@@ cle in a very short time .
now , i wonder@@ ed , how can i actually bring this up ?
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that tries to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze the idea of people here ?
i remem@@ ber@@ ed me last year when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es , and somehow the people liked it .
and the idea was really different for you , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
for energy , this was one of the things .
i decided that the ligh@@ t@@ ings of she@@ bs would be my this year-old contribu@@ tion to the environment here .
so here are a couple of natural fire@@ flies .
you &apos;ve as@@ sure that they don &apos;t catch me . in fact , they &apos;re not going to fall up the glass .
well , there are all kinds of play solutions like this , but they don &apos;t all bring a lot .
we need solutions , either one or a collective that is uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able , and even though there are lots of direc@@ tions where people are looking at it , i really see five who can afford these big dem@@ ands .
i &apos;ve left time , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
now this may be a great contribu@@ tion , and if you &apos;re more interested in this than i expect , i expect you to be great , but my core point here is that we have to work on all five , and we can &apos;t cut it up because they all have meaning@@ ful problems , because they all have meaning@@ ful problems .
let &apos;s first take a look at burning fossil fu@@ els of fossil fu@@ els , burning of coal or natural gas .
what you need to do is just seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to . you have to do all the co2 that comes out of the front of the lim@@ b , and then you &apos;re going to catch it out , and you &apos;re hop@@ ing somewhere , hop@@ ing and hop@@ ing that it sta@@ ys there .
there are some pil@@ ot@@ ot@@ ar projects that are going on on a 60 percent , 80 percent level , but it &apos;s very hard to get 100 percent very hard , and it &apos;s a big challenge , and it &apos;s a big challenge , and the biggest problem here is the cham@@ pi@@ -@@ time question .
who &apos;s going to make it safe ?
who can guar@@ an@@ tee , literally , many billion times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me .
so this is a tough ni@@ gh@@ ts@@ shop .
the next thing is nuclear energy .
and they also have three big problems , and the cost , particularly in highly traditional countries , are high . the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human work , that the fuel is not used for weapon@@ ber .
and what do you do with the tr@@ ash ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
so three very heavy problems that may be aff@@ ord@@ able , and one should work on this .
the last three of the five five people i &apos;ve sum@@ mar@@ ed
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ ables of rene@@ w@@ ables , as they &apos;re often known .
and also they have -- though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have a few la@@ ps .
one is the energy im@@ pac@@ ted that these technologies generate dra@@ matically lower than the power of power .
this is the energy of energy , you &apos;re talking about many square kilometers , 1,000 times more surface than a normal power plant .
and also these sources of information is under@@ lin@@ ing .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all the day , but it doesn &apos;t seem every single day , and the wind doesn &apos;t die all the time .
and therefore , when you &apos;re depen@@ dent on these sources , you have a way , the energy is also in times when it &apos;s not available .
so there &apos;s great global challenges . there are challenges in trans@@ mission , and when we say , for example , that the energy source is outside the country , it doesn &apos;t just need the technology , they also have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where different it comes from .
and there is the sal@@ acy problem .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of bat@@ ter@@ ies that are being made , looking at this : the car , computer phones , flas@@ h@@ lights , for everything , and i &apos;ve got the amount of electr@@ onic energy that affec@@ ted the world , and i found that with the amount of electr@@ onic energy that we produce now , and i found that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies that we produce now are going to be less than 10 minutes of all of the everyday power .
so we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approach of time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these remote facili@@ ties about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to leave about 100 percent of it , you need an incredible kind of beautiful battery .
now , where are we going to go : what is the right approach ?
one &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how are we going to get the goal ?
what we need are a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in every one of those five sur@@ faces , we need at least 100 people .
in a lot of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are a lot of people here in the ted group who are already involved in there .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among other companies , one called es@@ ol@@ ar , the great solar ther@@ mal@@ ar technology .
vin@@ ty k@@ ho@@ s@@ la has invest@@ ed in do@@ zens of companies the great things and interesting opportunities , and i &apos;m trying to support this .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i are fund@@ ing a company who , maybe surpris@@ ingly , follo@@ ws the nuclear approach .
there are a couple of innova@@ tions in the nuclear field , mod@@ ul@@ ary , flu@@ id .
in this industry , the development has stopped a couple of times ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concep@@ ts around the world are all around .
the ter@@ ra@@ city concept means that instead of a part of the ur@@ an , the one percent , the u.s. 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , which is 5@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never simu@@ late whether it was going to work , but since there are modern super@@ computers since there are modern super@@ computers , you can simu@@ late it and see that , yes . with the right material approach , it looks like this is func@@ tion@@ ing .
and because you burn these 99 percent , the cost profi@@ le is a lot better .
in fact , you burn the g@@ arb@@ age , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors to be used as a fuel .
so instead of breaking your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the ur@@ ani@@ um is consum@@ ed , a little bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
and you can see that there &apos;s a kind of a colum@@ n , often as &quot; running wave re@@ actor re@@ actor . &quot;
so this really tri@@ cks the fuel problem .
this is a picture of a theater in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s bur@@ ned today , so it says it &apos;s ev@@ at@@ u@@ ous ur@@ ani@@ um .
the store for hundreds of years is the u.s. for hundreds of
and if you &apos;re cheap in oce@@ ital ocean and you &apos;re just fil@@ ming you , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are still a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we need to measure our success .
what should our anima@@ tion look like ? &quot;
well , let &apos;s move to the goal that we have to reach , and then we talk about the inter@@ connec@@ tion .
a lot of talk from a 80 percent redu@@ ction by 20@@ 50 .
it &apos;s really very important that we &apos;ll get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in the poor countries , and there are still some agriculture , hopefully , and hopefully there &apos;s going to be clean ves@@ sel@@ s and colum@@ ning to get clean .
so , to get to this 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , their electricity generation completely spre@@ ading .
the other note is whether we use the zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , whether it &apos;s distribu@@ ted in all the developing world , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
this is super important .
this is going to be a key element of this .
when we go back from there , what should the 20@@ 20 conc@@ ern look like ?
and there should be those two elements .
we should use effec@@ tivi@@ ven@@ ess to get redu@@ ction on the road , and the less we em@@ it@@ ate , the less@@ s will be the carbon sum , and therefore the temperature will be the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re going to do , which doesn &apos;t go all the way down to the great re@@ co@@ very , just the same , or even slightly less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these break@@ through@@ s .
we have to track these break@@ through@@ s with whole gas , and we can measure that : in corpo@@ rate numbers , in pil@@ ot@@ y-@@ engineering and regu@@ lation changes .
there are a lot of great books on this top@@ ic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ y &apos;s energy energy is the hot energy . &quot;
they really go through and create a frame@@ work where this can be studied , because we need support from all the pages .
there are a couple of things that need to get together .
this is a wish .
a very con@@ cre@@ d@@ ented desire that we inv@@ ent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i love that wish , or i &apos;m going to choose this wish , which is hal@@ f-@@ cutting energy out@@ lines without co2 , and this wish , i &apos;m going to lose it .
and this has the greatest impact .
and if we don &apos;t get that wish , that will be terrible between long and shor@@ t-@@ term people , between the u.s. and china , between arms and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of the lives of those two billion will become a lot worse .
so , what do we need to do ?
what kind of action am i app@@ lic@@ ate for ?
we need to use more research fun@@ ds .
if countries are inter@@ acting in places like cop@@ el@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should join this innovation strategy , and they would be sho@@ cked by the ridi@@ cul@@ ous fun@@ ds that are going on for these innova@@ tive approach@@ es .
we need market sau@@ ces , carbon pump@@ s , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; trade : something that creates a price signal .
we &apos;ve got to spread the message .
we need to navi@@ gate dialo@@ gue and comple@@ t@@ less , and also the kinds of things that gover@@ n the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it up .
thanks very much .
thanks very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ tions a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us some notion of the size of this investment ?
bill gates : in order to get the simulation on a super@@ computer , all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , needs only a few 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve te@@ sted our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure it works reas@@ on@@ ably , you &apos;re only in the tens of millions of millions .
the diffic@@ ul@@ ous step is to build the first re@@ actor to find another billion billion , the regular and the location that actually build the spot of it .
once the first thing is , when he promis@@ es like this , everything is very clear , it &apos;s very clear , because the economy , the energy , is as different as nuclear energy , as we know it .
in order to understand this right , that is to build deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical mile fuel , that profit , and then the process starts , and then the process begins , and it &apos;s going to continue down ?
b@@ g : right . now you have to re@@ fill the re@@ actor again , so there are lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong , and this thing where you open it up and you get things in it -- and it &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it up for 60 years -- think about a colum@@ n -- think about a colum@@ n that you &apos;re wa@@ sting without all the complex stuff .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it bur@@ ns for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear re@@ actor , which even gives you a solution to g@@ arb@@ age .
b@@ g : yeah . now what happens with the waste : you can sit it down -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- you take it , and you put it in the next re@@ actor and burn it .
and we &apos;re going to start by taking the waste that already exists in those re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators or dr@@ us@@ h@@ es in the re@@ ac@@ tors , and this is our continu@@ ed fuel .
so , what that re@@ ac@@ tors for these re@@ ac@@ tors is a problem , which is what we put in our fil@@ ling , and therefore it &apos;s going to dra@@ matically reduce the cost of the price .
but as they talked to various people around the world , they have talked about these possibilities .
where is the greatest interest to really do this ?
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t really cap@@ tured a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting impli@@ cation for everything called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name , there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the company were in russi@@ a , india , china -- i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve met the energy agen@@ cy , and it &apos;s about how it &apos;s going to fall to the energy agenda
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have made something in the direction .
this is a vari@@ ant of a thing that was made .
now this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor , and some countries have built these , so everyone who &apos;s built a fast re@@ actor , a chan@@ nel for our first .
in your imagination , ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se and li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood is this thing really going to live in life ?
b@@ g : now we need one of these sc@@ al@@ able , low-@@ cost things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to inv@@ ent and then we use 20 years to use .
this is kind of the de@@ ad@@ line that has shown us the environmental model that we have to address .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ tic force , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it might seem easy .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds of , the same , the same way that the process is working , the fund@@ ing for your pil@@ ots work , can deliver it to it .
and it would be the best if it creates multiple things , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
any@@ less , we need a solution .
taking the great possible break@@ through@@ s , is this the biggest one you know ?
b@@ g : a energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
that would be true without the global requi@@ re@@ ment , but it still makes it so much more important .
so in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but we have the mod@@ ul@@ ous method , which is a different approach .
there is a liquid re@@ actor type that seems to seem a little bit hard , but maybe they say it &apos;s about us .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about this is that a national molecule has a million times as much energy as you can , say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the issues , and they are main@@ ly the radiation , the foot@@ print and the cost , the potential is true , the impact on the country , and other things , almost in a different lea@@ gue .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to introdu@@ ce emergen@@ cy action to try and hold out the earth &apos;s temperature ?
b@@ g : when you get into that situation , it &apos;s like you eat too much , and a heart attack is about a heart attack , and what do you do ? you need a heart surgery or something .
there is a research direc@@ tion called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which is associated with various techniques , to del@@ ay the warming , so that we &apos;ve got 20 or 30 years more to get away to collapse .
this is just an in@@ sur@@ ance method .
we hope that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say that you shouldn &apos;t be working in in@@ sur@@ ance because you may be wrong , because you &apos;re going to eat it , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart , if you have the importance of the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a dis@@ course of ge@@ o@@ engineering about whether you should have it available , if things get faster , or that innovation more innovation than we expect .
climate mas@@ ke@@ ke@@ ti : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for those who might be able to convince you ?
b@@ g : well unfortunately , skep@@ tics are all the skep@@ tics in very different cam@@ ps .
those who make the scientific argu@@ ments are very little .
do you say there are some negative impli@@ cations that have to do with the clou@@ ds that are going to move things ?
there are very , very few things you can ever tell you about where there is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is kind of like the familiar of aids .
you make the mistakes now , and you pay it a lot later .
and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve problems to invest from something that you &apos;ve only got later -- and what happens is that the investment is not so clear . in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c doesn &apos;t necessarily say the worst scen@@ ari@@ o , and there are people in the rich world who are looking at i@@ p@@ c@@ c , and they say , okay , that &apos;s not a big dra@@ ma .
the fact is that those un@@ certain@@ ty should be wor@@ rying to us .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time it &apos;s going to be the same co2 , then skep@@ tics also say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter me , i wish , &quot; ok , it &apos;s not going to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze co2 , i wish more that it &apos;s che@@ aper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the f@@ ie@@ l l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument that , if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all of the other goals in suffering , the poverty redu@@ ction , the redu@@ ction of malaria and so on , that it is a sil@@ ent waste of resource to invest money , while there are better things that we can do .
b@@ g : well , the real investment for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you do today -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
other things shouldn &apos;t suff@@ er out .
so , you get to big money , and you can dis@@ agree with reas@@ on@@ able people , if you have something that is not economic , and try to fin@@ ance that , and for me , most of the waste is going to happen .
unless it is , you know , you &apos;ve got a very short break@@ through and fund@@ ing only the learning cur@@ ve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be a lot more che@@ aper .
if the dis@@ hes you get is a very high energy spi@@ ce , it can only be the rich one to do .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy experiences without changing its lifest@@ yle .
for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks about it .
and his new ma@@ a is , &quot; why don &apos;t we r@@ ry research anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still being associated because of its former stories , with the skep@@ ti@@ st camp , but he &apos;s understood that this is a very , very one-@@ group group , and therefore he &apos;s going to bring the research argument .
and this is a thought that i think is appropriate to be appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it is to support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about most of the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
b@@ g : thank you very much .
a couple of years ago at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man wrote a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . four teams have to do the biggest possible structure with 20 sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , about 1@@ 1@@ meter ta@@ pe , about a mile of a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , about a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low needs to be up on the top .
and , although it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s really hard to work together , because it &apos;s very quick people to
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design work@@ shop .
it was a very big success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 work@@ sh@@ ops , with students , develop@@ ments and architec@@ ts and architec@@ ts , even with c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 5@@ 0-@@ dollar company , and there &apos;s something about this work that i want to share with , and i want to share with you some of them .
normally , most people start to ori@@ ent themselves into the task .
they talk about how it &apos;s going to look like what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s going to ran@@ k around .
and then they invest for a little bit of time in planning and organization . they &apos;re drawing and they &apos;re sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
they spend a majority of their time in the assem@@ bly constantly growing structures in the assem@@ bly .
and finally , soon before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and you put it on the top , you step back to the top , you step back and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; -- ad@@ mi@@ re you work .
but what , almost always , is that the ta@@ -@@ da is going to be a &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ cks , the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ cks , is that the whole thing is fl@@ our@@ ishing and fl@@ our@@ ishing .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh b@@ w@@ les &apos; ven@@ dered .
they lie , they che@@ w , they &apos;re conf@@ used , and they really make it possible .
and , of course , there are groups that have much more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; form , and the best ones are fresh reti@@ re@@ ments of childhood garden .
and this is pretty amazing .
as peter tells us , they don &apos;t just produce the highest to@@ wers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is , how is this going ? why is it ?
and peter tells , &quot; nei@@ ther one of the kids invest@@ ed in the head of the sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in ma@@ x@@ ul@@ ation .
now , there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that b@@ w@@ ames &apos;s students were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then to re@@ constru@@ ct it .
now , what happens when you put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds very familiar , what ?
what car@@ gar@@ men do differently is they start using mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and building prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so that they have a number of times the possibility of fix@@ ing b@@ loo@@ ded prototyp@@ es .
con@@ struc@@ tors recognize this kind of partner as an i@@ ter@@ ative enti@@ fi@@ can@@ ce .
and with every trial , the kids get immedi@@ ate feedback , what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the achie@@ vement is to work with prototyp@@ es , prac@@ tically -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are operating .
the average average for most lies is at about seven in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ ames &apos;s students , half of them , but not much , kinder@@ garten kids are better than the adults .
who is the most successful thing ?
architec@@ ts and engineers , for lu@@ ck@@ ings .
1@@ five is the highest thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
and why ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles , and the self-@@ integr@@ ated ge@@ om@@ et@@ ding ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric pattern are the key to build .
ce@@ os is a little bit about average . but here &apos;s what &apos;s going to be interesting
if you put a more ex@@ cep@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , you &apos;re signific@@ antly better at the same time
it &apos;s amazing . you look around and you realize &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
you can predict the predi@@ ction . why is it happening ?
because they have special skills of the process@@ ing address .
they &apos;re leading the process ; they understand it .
and this team that &apos;s exp@@ and@@ ing and working on work is going to signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance .
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ ability skills and their combin@@ ation to success@@ fully success@@ ture
if you have 10 teams who are typical , you &apos;ll get about six , those stable structures .
so i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought , you know , let &apos;s bring the po@@ ist up .
so i created a $ 100,000 prize of software for the w@@ inner .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
so what was the result ?
this is what happened . it wasn &apos;t a team of a stable structure .
if anybody had built a two-@@ in@@ ch con@@ struc@@ tion , he would have car@@ ried the prize home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competi@@ tions have a strong effect ?
we re@@ co@@ ved this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened to this ?
now , they understood the use@@ ing of prototyp@@ ing .
this is how , from the same , bad team , one under the best .
they produced the highest construction of activity in the wild time .
there &apos;s such deep lea@@ je@@ c@@ tory for us , talking about nature , and success .
and you might ask : why would somebody actually invest a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low wor@@ ch@@ worth ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , to help them , to make autos , video games and search .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low &apos;s challenge does is , it helps you identify hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the challenge provi@@ des a common experience , a common language , a basic language , of building the right prototyp@@ e .
and this is the value of this experience , this is the kind of simple exercise .
and those of you who care about , you know , mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ lock ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ cks building .
there &apos;s a ste@@ p-@@ up per@@ pe@@ tual man@@ ual there .
they find crazy examples from all over the world , how people can op@@ ft and re@@ pair the system .
there are also world recor@@ ds .
and the base lesson , i think , is the structure , actually , is a conne@@ ctive sport .
it requires us all our senses to work on the task , and that we use our thinking of thinking , like our emotions and our , in the challen@@ ging that we &apos;re facing .
and sometimes a small prototyp@@ e of this experience is anything that we need to bring us from a &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; -- to bring it to a &quot; u@@ h-@@ da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big distin@@ ct .
thanks very much .
let &apos;s do this as if we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , ted-@@ l-@@ like machine , and this is a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
and they can go to the past ; they can &apos;t go into the future ; they can &apos;t be in here now .
and i wonder@@ ed what they would choose , because i &apos;d often asked my friends a lot at the time , and they wanted to go into the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there was cars or twitter , or &quot; america , &quot; the super@@ the@@ tics .
and i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re kind of a no@@ stal@@ gi@@ an , and you &apos;ve moved to dar@@ k@@ y thinking .
and i do understand that .
i &apos;m not a part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back to this planet ; they &apos;re going forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the great time ever ever on the planet , no matter how sal it is : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , eff@@ und@@ ance rates , dec@@ lin@@ ing rates .
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died all the time they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents commit@@ ted that number to 70 .
my parents are at the age of the hood .
so there &apos;s supposed to be more than nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than it is .
a child who is born today in new del@@ hi can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world 100 years ago .
think about that . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is this that ?
small@@ po@@ x . the small@@ po@@ x have killed billions of people on the planet .
they &apos;ve re-@@ sha@@ ped the demo@@ graphic of the earth in a way that has no war ever did .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re disappe@@ ared .
we &apos;ve as@@ s@@ essed them . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world there are diseases that have millions of us even thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by one generation , har@@ dly .
di@@ ph@@ on , ju@@ ff , child paraly@@ sis ...
does anyone know what this is ?
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are success@@ pris@@ es of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and find out how it works , if it doesn &apos;t do it , if it doesn &apos;t do it , is one of the great achie@@ v@@ ements of humanity .
so , that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s a whole good news already , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that , in spi@@ te of all of our achie@@ v@@ ements , a billion people around the world every day go to bed every day .
and that number goes up , and it gets very quick , and it &apos;s embar@@ ras@@ sing .
and not only that , we used our imagination to de@@ va@@ stat@@ ate this world in a way .
drin@@ king water , ma@@ th@@ able land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas : they disappe@@ ar , and unless we don &apos;t treat ourselves from that chaos , we &apos;re going to disappe@@ ar .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it is .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , that will feed billions of people without the land that they live on .
i think we can control this world with energy that they &apos;re not destro@@ ying at the same time .
i really think that &apos;s , and no , that &apos;s not a clou@@ dy thinking .
but this is going to wake up at night -- one of the things that &apos;s holding me up at night , and we &apos;ve never had science progress before , like now , never .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it in a reas@@ on@@ able way as we can .
we &apos;re at the box to amazing , amazing events on many areas , and i really think that we have to go back to the re@@ mind of 300 years before the effort , to find a period where we &apos;ve been strug@@ gling on these things where we &apos;ve been sus@@ pi@@ cious about these things , more fron@@ ts than now .
people are going to be in their belie@@ fs , so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t rele@@ ase them .
it &apos;s not even the truth that it &apos;s going to rele@@ ase it .
and listen , everyone has a right to think about his opini@@ on , even a right to think about it .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right about ?
they don &apos;t have a right to have their own facts . &apos; &quot; sorry , don &apos;t have it . &quot;
and i took a long time to figure out this .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vac@@ cin@@ ations for &quot; the new yor@@ ker , &quot; a little article .
and i was ama@@ zed to con@@ front resi@@ stance , to resi@@ stance by what is ultimately the most effective enti@@ tion in human history in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i was doing , i wrote an article , and i went on .
and soon , i wrote an article about gene@@ tically modi@@ fied fo@@ ol@@ ers .
same thing , it &apos;s just bigger .
the people played crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why the people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken food , &quot; why they believed that molecules had a random way to move around the real@@ m of nature .
but , you know , i &apos;m doing what i &apos;m doing . i wrote the article , i &apos;ll go further .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we p@@ lot , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this paper wor@@ ries me , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and finally i found out why , and finally i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics that i &apos;ve been hum@@ logi@@ cal at all were no fan@@ tas@@ ics at all .
these were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , inno@@ cent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that completely brought me together ...
but then i thought , well , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
we have arrived at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to be .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we talk about ir@@ on@@ ically , with a little bit of leadership , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what reason they are .
we have the trust in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science , sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call a couple of names , and people will understand .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ ad@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , mass destruction of mass destruction , which is u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction .
i mean , you know , you &apos;re going to vote your own list .
there are questions and problems about the people that we thought they were always right . so , you know , so , well , you &apos;re skep@@ tical about the people that we
ask them asking , ask evidence , ask you a demon@@ stration .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but here &apos;s it : if you get a pro@@ of of evidence , you &apos;ve got to accept this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell this for the reason that we live now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story published about 12 years ago , a terrible story , which led the autis@@ m epidemic with the mas@@ ses , mu@@ mp@@ s , and the vac@@ cin@@ ate v@@ acc@@ ine .
very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
addi@@ ctive studies were done to see if that was true .
bright trials should be done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
and the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no link , no link , no .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we think about an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we believe we feel real .
we don &apos;t think about a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government admini@@ stration , which gives us data , and i understand that , i think we &apos;re all doing .
but , you know what ?
the result of this was a disaster ha@@ l .
cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ l is about this fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world where the imm@@ uni@@ cs are dec@@ lin@@ ing for mas@@ ses .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ e@@ s , and we should be aware about .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
what &apos;s going to happen is that we could do that .
well , i understand . i do . i do .
because anybody &apos;s going to mas@@ ner ?
does a single person in the audience who ever sees anybody die ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it doesn &apos;t happen at all , but 6@@ 0,000 times in the world , but 6@@ 0,000 times in the world last year
these are a lot of dea@@ ths through dent@@ als , 20 per hour .
but , because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can use it , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and sound mes@@ sages of these plat@@ forms such as op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king live pre@@ ding of plat@@ forms .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect copy@@ and and cor@@ relation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but it &apos;s almost never the same thing .
and this is something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quick .
and this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he liber@@ ated us from one of the worst ro@@ cks of humanity .
no fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , no fra@@ ction , child equipment , pu@@ ff , disappe@@ ared .
the guy in the middle wasn &apos;t so much .
he &apos;s called paul bot@@ it .
he &apos;s just developed a ro@@ ta@@ vir@@ us v@@ acc@@ ine with a couple of other people .
he can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ - , 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , this is good , except paul talks around and talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how valuable they are , and that people should stop to get married .
and that &apos;s actually what it says .
so , paul is a terror@@ ist .
when paul talks spea@@ ks in a public address , he can &apos;t say no to a be@@ ar@@ red be@@ a@@ der .
he &apos;s going to get calls home , because people like to tell him that they know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vac@@ cin@@ es are un@@ dis@@ placed .
take it all up , go back the diseases , horri@@ ble diseases , and this is what happens .
we &apos;ve been mas@@ sing in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die back to it , because that &apos;s just a matter of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die on mas@@ ses .
what about private paraly@@ sis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a com@@ bat of com@@ bat from me gave me a couple of weeks ago , and he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;m a little bit to pun@@ ch .
no one &apos;s ever said this before .
she didn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate her child , not imm@@ uni@@ cally . absolutely no .
f@@ ure .
why ? because we don &apos;t have any child paraly@@ sis . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a car paraly@@ sis in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in la@@ gos ton@@ ight , he &apos;s going to go to a plane , and she &apos;s going to fly to los angeles right now . he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
and in a couple of hours , he lands a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of those fantastic ted@@ s@@ ession ton@@ ight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ zing disease , and we don &apos;t know about it either , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to sha@@ p into lies . we love that .
have you taken all your vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a small anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ ti@@ st that helps you get on those things .
i know you &apos;ve done that , because half of americans do it every day .
they take this stuff , and they take alterna@@ tions , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find them that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
it &apos;s all the data that &apos;s going on .
they sha@@ ke their ur@@ ine . more . they never do it .
this is ok , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ in .
i &apos;m going to agree with you .
dark ur@@ in . dar@@ k@@ ness .
why do we do that ? why are we going to do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical industry .
we hate a very strong government . we don &apos;t have a trust in the system .
and we don &apos;t have to . our healthcare system is mi@@ es .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely un@@ belie@@ vable cold and sou@@ si@@ ven@@ ess self to us that it can afford .
so we run out of the road , and where are we going to go ?
we &apos;re walking into the poor of plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
this is great . i love the plac@@ e@@ bo industri@@ es .
but , you know , that &apos;s a really serious thing , because the stuff is cra@@ m@@ ble , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars to do it .
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ mp@@ ts here .
no one -- g@@ ing@@ ko , fr@@ ich , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ ich , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s a@@ er@@ e@@ au@@ e .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scre@@ w me up and say , &quot; what car@@ es you ? let people do what you want . &quot;
that &apos;s how you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;ve got wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the health minister , which says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m going to not consider the evidence of my experts to mammo@@ graph@@ y , or some cancer box , who wants to treat his patients with dent@@ al supp@@ lies .
when you go to this way where belie@@ fs and magic supp@@ ages and science replace science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get up to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
he gather@@ ed 40@@ 0,000 of his people because he realized that red be@@ ats , bone and le@@ mon oil is much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs , which we know is going to be the case of aids g@@ ap@@ s .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ likely dea@@ ths in a country that is worse than any other disease is fossi@@ li@@ zed .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have a con@@ sequence .
they &apos;ve got them . they always have them .
well , the most bra@@ thi@@ est epidemic we &apos;re facing is this ab@@ und@@ ant battle between the ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy of vulnerable nutri@@ tivity and bio@@ -@@ eli@@ tes .
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it &apos;s going to stop .
it &apos;s a debate talking about words , metaph@@ ors .
this is ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
everything that we eat , every single pet , every second pe@@ ac@@ ue , each br@@ us@@ fish , has been changed by the people .
you know , there was no mand@@ ar@@ in in par@@ ad@@ ise .
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ -@@ hit@@ es .
there was no christ@@ mas trees . we did all this stuff .
we &apos;ve done it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it works , and some of them don &apos;t .
we have gotten rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can make it more specific . and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a in ri@@ ce , and the stuff can help millions of people to exp@@ and their life .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we have alter@@ ically alter@@ ed food away .
why are we going to do that ?
well , what i hear all the time : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to be huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s fal@@ se .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies . we don &apos;t want to patent .
we don &apos;t want to have companies see@@ ds .
and do you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s pull it up .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but it &apos;s not science .
and that doesn &apos;t have science to do with science .
it &apos;s right , mor@@ ality , pat@@ ren@@ r@@ art .
you know the science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to do it , and it kee@@ ps millions of people out of fl@@ our@@ ishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow more food more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this is a conversation in africa over the last 30 years .
sh@@ ame . sh@@ ame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it .
and why ? gene@@ tically , gene@@ tically alter@@ ed fo@@ ods .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated stuff , such as mani@@ words .
mani@@ words is something that &apos;s half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
it &apos;s just a b@@ und@@ le cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all of that .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be going to be ignor@@ ed .
they wouldn &apos;t be star@@ vation , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
and all i can tell you is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why are we fighting this ?
because we don &apos;t want to sho@@ ot a gene around ?
it &apos;s not about sla@@ ding genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our an@@ ger on larger food , better food , profound fo@@ ods .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be highest time to understand what that means .
why do you know what ?
and if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do something like this , i think we &apos;re not going to be gu@@ il@@ ty , high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism , we &apos;re not going
there is no other descri@@ ption of what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s more sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s not wor@@ thy , and we really have to stop it .
so , according to this incredibly funny entertain@@ ment , you might say , &quot; do you still want to be in this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and you &apos;re going to go into the future ? &quot;
definitely . i don &apos;t want to . i don &apos;t want to .
at the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can make this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them up where we want to move them up , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we have to do these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we need to think , but when we go into the time machine , and we &apos;ll go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have done that .
i know we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , this is something that the world needs now .
so thank you .
so thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the interpretation of plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and it may seem strange that a ma@@ gi@@ cian is interested in it , unless you look at it as me , as i do , &quot; a de@@ ception that &apos;s going to happen to something that &apos;s going to happen when someone just belie@@ ves it . &quot;
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in a number of studies , just because the person thinks what &apos;s going on with you is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical effect or a kind of -- in the book management , for example , there is , if the patient is only enough to believe it , a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body that you call the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
a de@@ ception is going to be a good thing , because somebody feels it like this .
so , in order for us to also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that at least since 195@@ 0s , he &apos;s in every magic book for kids at least since the 195@@ 0s .
i even learned him from the p@@ b sc@@ ale of the p@@ y@@ b rou@@ te in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and then explain him .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i simpli@@ fy it .
so , see what &apos;s going on .
the kni@@ fe that you can study ; my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold the kni@@ fe into my feet like this .
i &apos;m going to get back my sle@@ e@@ ve .
and to make sure nothing gets stuck in my sle@@ e@@ ve or coming out out of it , i &apos;m just going to push my wr@@ ist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time is going to move anything , and as long as i &apos;m watching here , nothing can go out in my sle@@ e@@ ve or come out .
and the goal with this is pretty simple .
i &apos;m going to open up my hand , hopefully , and hopefully , if everything is good , the kni@@ fe is dis@@ played by my na@@ sty physical magne@@ tis@@ m .
it actually si@@ ts so hard at its place , that i can sha@@ p it without the kni@@ fe .
there &apos;s nothing going on in my sle@@ e@@ ve or coming out , no dou@@ bt , and you can study everything .
ta@@ -@@ da !
now , this is a trick that i often teach young kids who are interested in magic magic , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception , when you look at a very simple thing , even though it &apos;s a very simple thing to do .
probably a lot of you in the room probably know this trick .
and it works like this .
i hold up the kni@@ fe in my hand .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m going to go around my wr@@ ist to make sure that nothing is going on in my sle@@ e@@ ve or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
and the reason i wra@@ p my wr@@ ist is that there is the essential secret of illusion .
and in that moment , where i fli@@ pped my hand away , so you see it from the back , you move down these fing@@ ers here , you move down these fing@@ ers here , just where it was , in a position where it &apos;s like this .
great sk@@ im@@ ding ?
there is somebody behind the back there who didn &apos;t have a childhood .
so , he &apos;s standing here . right .
and as i turn around , the fing@@ ers change its position .
and now you may talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fing@@ ers here , because the mind and the way it process@@ es information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but you can see them as a group .
but that &apos;s not really what &apos;s going on . and then i open my hand .
of course , there &apos;s going to be stuck there , but not through the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but through a trick , through my inde@@ x fing@@ ers , which is there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing that happens by invi@@ te me is going to be hidden by this movement that the fing@@ ers will move back back back back .
i take this hand away . and here is the kni@@ fe .
this is a trick you can do with your friends and your neighb@@ ors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that was really up@@ set with me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or an researchers , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
and it turns out , if you offer a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , in the form of an as@@ pi@@ in@@ a tab@@ let , it &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill that has a particular effect .
but if you give the shape where you give the plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , to change in a smaller p@@ ill , you change these blue and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ able more effectively .
and that , even though none of them are a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re just sugar p@@ ills .
but a white pil@@ e@@ gel is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? i got really out of it .
and it turns out that this is not all of us .
when you take cap@@ su@@ les , the more effective than the tab@@ lets are every form .
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , which is at the end of yellow and at the other red , is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
the do@@ sage also plays a role .
a p@@ ill twice is twice a daily day , not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember the right stati@@ stic . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing to do is ...
... the do@@ ses also matter in a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you &apos;ve got to stop the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with an ab@@ und@@ ant -- a few milli@@ bor@@ ters of a us@@ eless sub@@ stance that you inje@@ ct a patient .
that creates a very strong image in the head , and it &apos;s much stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
this ch@@ art is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a proje@@ ctor .
so the fact is that the white pil@@ e@@ le doesn &apos;t seem as well as the blue p@@ ill , which doesn &apos;t seem as well as a cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t seem as well as the need@@ le .
and none of it has a really , really pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical property . it &apos;s just our belief in which it invol@@ ves a stron@@ ger effect .
and i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that obviously is a de@@ ception , and let me look at it really real .
we know from the study that you have to stop the need@@ le , if it &apos;s supposed to go to this thing .
this is a 18 in@@ ch long chicken need@@ le . it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to get you a little bit more ster@@ ili@@ zed first .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not ste@@ a@@ an speci@@ alized fl@@ at@@ es .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to wind up this need@@ le in my skin and pull through it , and i &apos;m going to pull it back to the other side of the box .
and if you get stuck -- if you fall down easily -- i was introduced by a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some of the people i didn &apos;t know , and there was a woman that i didn &apos;t know about , and it was almost ir@@ redu@@ c@@ ous .
so i &apos;m suggest@@ ing if you get a little bit anno@@ y , you go away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sa@@ oth part here .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also see it away , too .
so , you know , right here , right here , where my meat starts , i &apos;m just going to do a little one at the bottom of my piece .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make it crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side of the back again .
we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we &apos;ve had at the mes@@ g@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
just about .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , you know ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think , when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s certainly not that stupid , and it takes itself to take the skin just to pay us for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back in the back saying , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
the people in the back@@ sides are now going to come in .
let me show you a little bit away .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my fl@@ ore , and i can fli@@ p this around .
sorry . if you get stuck , look away , look at you , don &apos;t look at me .
now , the people behind the back or the one who later see a video at some point , are going to say , &quot; well , that looks very impres@@ sive , but if it was real , you &apos;ll see , here &apos;s a hole , and there , if it really would be real real , it would b@@ low it . &quot;
all right , let me just wra@@ p out a bit of blood for you .
yes , here it is .
and i usually want to take the need@@ le out here .
i would clean my arm , and show you that there are no je@@ is@@ s .
but i think in this frame here , and with the inten@@ tion of making a de@@ ception of something real , i &apos;m going to leave the need@@ le just in there , and i &apos;m going to go from stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next couple of days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy that . thank you very much .
everybody spea@@ ks today about lu@@ ck .
i have some people waiting the number of books that have been rele@@ ased with &quot; happiness , &quot; in the last five years , and they put care of about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there is a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among the researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of lu@@ ck@@ ing co@@ ach@@ ing .
and everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but despite all those ti@@ ghts of work , there are several cognitive appe@@ ars that are sort of impossible to think about it , just to think about lu@@ ck .
and my talk today is going to be main@@ ly about these cognitive tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
this is true for la@@ kes that think about their own fortun@@ e , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about lu@@ ck , because it turns out we &apos;re going to be exactly so ab@@ und@@ ant as everyone else .
the first of those is a dis@@ pu@@ te of complexity to ad@@ mit complexity .
and it turns out that the word fortun@@ e is simply not useful word , because we &apos;re appl@@ ying it up too many different things
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we can bor@@ row it on , but in a very large way , this is something we have to pass up , and we &apos;re going to take the complicated view of what &apos;s well-@@ being .
the second st@@ all is an opportunity of experience and memory : it &apos;s basically where it is between happy in its life or happy with his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both inter@@ rup@@ ted in the notion of happiness .
and the third is concent@@ rational illusion , and this is the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about a circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without caus@@ ing its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
there is just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with a sam@@ ple of someone who had a questi@@ on@@ -@@ and-@@ answer meeting , after one of my lec@@ tures who described a story . &#91; un@@ clear -- &#93; he said he had a ph@@ on@@ ony , and it was absolutely popular music , and at the end of the break , there was a terrible res@@ ad@@ ment of sound .
and then he sat up , really quite emotion@@ ally , and this is the whole experience that ru@@ ins the whole experience .
but that &apos;s not what it didn &apos;t .
and what it ru@@ ined was the memor@@ ies of the experience .
he &apos;d had the experience .
he had spent 20 minutes worth of small@@ ly music .
they didn &apos;t speak because he was a memory of memory ; the memory was ru@@ in@@ ed , and the memory was everything he had gotten to keep hold .
what this really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people &apos;s sense of it in terms of two kinds of self .
there is a living self that lives in the present , and knowing the present , is able to experience the past , but basically has the present .
it &apos;s the driving self , which is the doctor deci@@ ding -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; do you hurt it now if i &apos;m going to put it here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a remin@@ ding self , and the memory self is that which is going on and the history of our life gets up@@ right , and it &apos;s the one who &apos;s going to address the doctor by saying , &quot; how did you feel true in the last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; what was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different un@@ its , the living self , and the memory itself , and the two of them are part of the impact of lu@@ ck .
now , the memory itself is a story@@ t@@ eller .
and this really starts with a profound response to our memor@@ ies -- it starts on immediately .
we &apos;re not just telling stories when we &apos;re going to tell stories about it .
our memory tells us stories , which means that what we can hold away from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s just start with a sam@@ ple .
and there is an old study .
these are real patients who pull themselves a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
i won &apos;t go into the details . it &apos;s not more pain@@ ful today , but it was pain@@ ful to be done as this study in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their recor@@ ds .
and you &apos;ll ask , &quot; who of both have suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b clearly suff@@ ered more . his appe@@ ar@@ ance was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had hal@@ f-@@ ax@@ es , and more .
but now , there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients thought they were anno@@ ying ? &quot;
and here &apos;s what a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient was a much worse remem@@ ber@@ ing remin@@ ding that the patient &apos;s refle@@ ction was as ab@@ und@@ ant .
the stories of repres@@ entation were different , and because a very cru@@ cial part of the story is different , how it ends up .
and none of these stories is very u@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly or great -- but one of them is this great ...
but one of them is very sever@@ ely worse than the other .
and the one that &apos;s worse about where the pain was at the end of it , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to look at their gut refle@@ ction , and a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a while for me than b in the memory .
now , this is a direct conflict between the occu@@ mate self and the memory itself .
and from the course of the working self , it was clearly a worse time .
now , what you could do with the patient , and we actually have a clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been made , and it works , and it works , you could actually ex@@ tend the diagra@@ m of the patient by hit@@ ting the tube without too much to sha@@ ke it up too much .
it &apos;s going to lead to the patient , but just a little bit less and less than before .
and if you do this for a few minutes , the fact that the living self is worse self from the patient , and you have to make sure that the memory of the patient is much better off , because now you &apos;ve got a better story about your experience .
so what is a story about ?
and that is true for the stories that require us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we inv@@ ent .
and what a story expres@@ sed a story is sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ing , important moments and end .
end is very , very important , and in this case , the end was domin@@ ated .
now , the living self alive lives its life continu@@ ously .
it &apos;s got moments of life , one by the other .
and you &apos;re asking : what &apos;s going on with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve measu@@ red this -- you know , psych@@ ological statistics -- for about three seconds , which means , you know , there are about 600 million of them in one life ; what is , you know , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 . most of you don &apos;t leave any tra@@ ce .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by remem@@ ber@@ ing themselves from remem@@ ber@@ ing themselves .
and yet , you somehow get the impres@@ sion that you should count that what &apos;s happening during this view of life is our life .
it is the limited resource that we consu@@ me as we are in the world .
and as we consu@@ me it would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that kee@@ ps the memory itself to keep us .
so we have the memory self and the living themselves , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the opportunity to deal with .
and from the perspective of working , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is exactly as good as the first one , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the lon@@ din@@ -@@ day vac@@ ation .
it doesn &apos;t work at all . it doesn &apos;t work at all .
and for remem@@ ber@@ ing yourself , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is har@@ dly better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation , because there is no new memory to be ad@@ ded .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is really the critical vari@@ able that a remin@@ ding self is different from one day , and time has very little impact on this story .
now , the memory itself makes more than remem@@ ber@@ ing and to tell stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who , if you have a patient , who , say , had two different fac@@ dings and deci@@ des what it should choose , then the one who choo@@ ses the memory , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that will be sel@@ ec@@ ted .
the living self doesn &apos;t have a voice in that choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose to vote between experience . we choose between memor@@ ies of experience .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think about our future as an experience .
we think about our future as a predi@@ ction of memor@@ ies .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of memory itself , and you can think of yourself as a thought of self as one , which is kind of the living self of experiences that doesn &apos;t need to use .
i have the impres@@ sion that if we do a vac@@ ation , it &apos;s very often the case , which is , we &apos;re making vac@@ ation at the service of remem@@ ber@@ ing itself .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
i mean , how do we store from our memor@@ ies ?
this is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of memory itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a vac@@ ation that we &apos;ve made in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a a couple of years ago , which is clear to the best vac@@ ation that i &apos;ve ever had , and i think quite often , in propor@@ tion , how often i think about other vac@@ ations i think .
and i probably have some memory from my memor@@ ies to this three-@@ week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened up the epi@@ der with 600 images in it , i &apos;d spent a long hour .
now , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s only about a one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours .
and there seems to be a dis@@ agre@@ ement .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , how much more appe@@ ti@@ te i have on the dan@@ ks of memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we choose so much of it . why do we choose to choose so much weight in the main@@ ths to be challen@@ ged ?
and so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation , all of your images are de@@ va@@ st@@ ated , and you get a am@@ ai drug so that you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose to choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you choose to choose another vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kinds of self , and you &apos;ve got to think about how you choose this conflict , and it &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll get an answer . and if you think about memor@@ ies , you might get a different answer .
why we choose the resili@@ ence that we choose to choose is a problem that invol@@ ves us with a choice between the two kinds of self
well , the two kinds of self is going to stop two points of lu@@ ck .
in fact , there are two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so , you can ask : how happy is the diet itself ?
and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the labor itself ?
and you &apos;re all -- lucky looking at moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red to ?
and , by the way , we are now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from the in@@ sur@@ ity itself over time .
and if you look at the lu@@ ck of remem@@ ber@@ ing itself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it doesn &apos;t matter how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or pleasure the person is , if this person is thinking about their life .
very different phr@@ ase .
anybody who doesn &apos;t differ@@ enti@@ ate these terms is going to collapse the study of happiness , and i &apos;m willing to do a lot of researchers about well-@@ being who have sha@@ ped the research of interest in exactly this way .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the effort itself and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the memory itself has been recogni@@ zed in the last few years , and now you &apos;re strug@@ gling to measure the two distance .
the gall@@ up organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asking questions about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other effort in the direction of it .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve been starting to learn about the lu@@ ck of the self .
and the main lesson that i think we learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy somebody with his life is , and they really don &apos;t teach them a lot about how happy he lives and vice around .
just to give you an idea of cor@@ relation , which is about cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is that if you meet somebody , and you &apos;d tell you , oh , his father is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
well , you &apos;d know something about his size , but there is a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
when i tell you that someone has introduced his life as eight on a scale of ten , she has a lot un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy he is with his in@@ dul@@ ity .
so the cor@@ relation is a little bit .
we know a little bit about what the happiness of happiness itself is .
we know that money is extremely important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly to be satis@@ fied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is domin@@ ant .
so , if you want ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the two kinds of self , you &apos;ll do very different things at the end of the day .
the impli@@ cation of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t really have to think about ourselves as an assem@@ bly for well-@@ being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very brie@@ fly , another reason that we can &apos;t really think about lu@@ ck about lu@@ ck is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are going to not get the right answer .
if you ask this question , you know , people in california must be happ@@ ier if they , say , live in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is that , if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , let &apos;s say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that the climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the da@@ wn self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
well , because the se@@ arch@@ ing self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could go to california at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pur@@ sue what happens to people who are hop@@ ing to go to california in the hope .
well , you &apos;re not going to become happ@@ ier , you &apos;re going to be happ@@ ier .
we know this .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happ@@ ier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be remem@@ ber@@ ed about how awful the weather in o@@ hi@@ o was , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right choice .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-@@ being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you an idea of how difficult it is .
so thank you .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thanks very much .
now , when we announ@@ ced a couple of weeks ago , she told me that there was a pretty interesting conclu@@ sion that came out of that gall@@ on .
is this something that you can participa@@ te to us , because you have a few minutes left ?
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ wi@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting conclu@@ sion we &apos;ve found in the gall@@ on survey is a number that we have absolutely not anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated .
we felt that in terms of the lu@@ ck of being able to be involved .
when we looked at how feelings interact with survival .
and it turns out that under a wealth of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sam@@ ple of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a great repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple , under a period of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year , under a population of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year .
6@@ 0,000 people .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 , one .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year are people un@@ happy , and they become increasingly less happ@@ ier , the more un@@ happy they will .
we get an absolutely flat line on this .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen a flat lines , obviously .
what happens is , obviously , that money is not a experience fortun@@ e , but that lack of money is definitely sus@@ pe@@ ctive , and we can measure this dam@@ ly very , very clear .
in the spirit of the other self , the memory itself , you get a different story .
the more money you ear@@ n the more happy you are .
it doesn &apos;t matter for emotions .
but dan@@ ny , in all of the american coun@@ cil , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
so , if people take this very seriously , i mean , i mean , it seems to put everything on the head , everything we believe , for example , about ta@@ x policy and so on .
is there an opportunity that politicians , generally , is that , generally , the fact that the country would take a gli@@ ve@@ ver@@ s@@ ary and do it based on politics ?
d@@ k : well , you know , i think there are recogni@@ tion for the role of success in politics .
the recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. it happens , but in other countries , they appear to happen .
people are trying to realize that they should think of lu@@ ck when they think about policy .
it &apos;s going to take a long time , and people are going to debate whether they want experience to explore their experience , so if they want to study food analysis , so we have to get this discussion quite soon .
how to increase happiness is going to be very different depen@@ dent on how you think and whether you think about it yourself , or whether you think about it , or whether you think
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , it helps to measure the experience of the population &apos;s happiness .
this is going to , i think , in the next decade or two or two of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this top@@ ic is going to be , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to pur@@ sue over the next couple of years .
thank you so much for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
thank you so , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m a jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , how you &apos;re lin@@ ked in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of you , to spend more time with playing bigger games and great games .
currently , we &apos;re spending three billion hours a week playing with online games .
now some of you might be thinking , &quot; this is a whole bunch of time for games . &quot;
perhaps a little too much time , if you think about how many problems we really need to solve in the real world .
in fact , in the institute of my research for the future , it &apos;s exactly the ex@@ act opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most comp@@ elling problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dra@@ matically increase this time .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated that there has been 21 billion hours a week has been spent .
this may seem a little bit anno@@ y@@ able , so i repe@@ at it to make it happen , so i repe@@ at it so that , if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think we have to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the
no , i mean , i mean it &apos;s serious .
why ? this picture is quite exactly , why i think games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . it &apos;s serious .
this is a photograph@@ er named phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o portra@@ me .
he wanted to capture the emotions in the game , so he built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classi@@ cal expres@@ sions in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you &apos;re going to inv@@ ent some of the nu@@ an@@ ces in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sen@@ sation of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little fear , but also the first concent@@ ration of concent@@ ra@@ tions , a really challen@@ ging problem , a really challen@@ ging problem .
now , if you play , you &apos;ll see some nu@@ an@@ ces here , sitting up to the top of the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m . the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ w tells surprise .
this is a player standing on the edge of a so-@@ called an epi@@ c se@@ a@@ ff .
oh , you know that . ok . pri@@ ming . so we &apos;ve got some players here .
a epi@@ c of an epi@@ c is a result which is so u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous , that they didn &apos;t know exi@@ sted at all .
it was almost by the imagination of the imagination .
and when they do it , they &apos;re sho@@ cked that they actually do something like this , and that &apos;s an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
and this player is just about temporary vic@@ tory .
and this is what we need to see in a million faces of proble@@ m-@@ solving around the world , if we &apos;re attac@@ king the barri@@ ers of the next century , the face of those who are dest@@ in@@ ating against all of the cor@@ respon@@ ds on the edge of a soli@@ cal mile .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life , when we meet hard problems .
i re@@ fer to it as the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; and it really is my face , you see ? yeah ? ok
this is me , like i &apos;m a bad face , i &apos;m making a bad face .
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i studied in my on@@ stry work , why we are better in play than in real life .
this is a problem that a lot of players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in the reality as we &apos;re playing .
and i don &apos;t just mean less success@@ fully , even though that &apos;s what it bel@@ on@@ gs to .
we do more in playing worl@@ ds . i mean , i &apos;m good at making motivation to do something meaning@@ ful , inspired with collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us turn into our best version , any@@ time , and inst@@ antly be hel@@ p@@ ful to resol@@ ve the problem , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary , getting it back as long as it is wrong .
and in reality , if we &apos;re fail@@ ing on ob@@ stac@@ les , we &apos;re often feeling different in a very different way
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we feel f@@ ought . we feel fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ c .
we &apos;ve never had these feelings if we play games , you just don &apos;t have to play .
and this is what i wanted to investi@@ gate as a ph@@ .@@ d. .
why is it impossible to think , not thinking , you could not just reach anything out ?
how do we distribu@@ te those feelings from play into reality ?
and so i looked at play like the world of war@@ craft , which provi@@ des the ide@@ al environment to collabor@@ ate .
and i &apos;ve noticed a couple of things that are the epi@@ ic ra@@ yers in online worl@@ ds .
so , first of all , if you go into one of those online games , particularly in the world of war@@ craft , there are a lot of different characters willing to trust you a world mission , right away .
but not just any mission , but a mission that cor@@ respon@@ ds perfectly to its current level in the game , right ?
so they &apos;re going to get that .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so you have to look at it , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in the world of war@@ craft .
you don &apos;t sit around , and you throw it up . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are addi@@ cts of staf@@ f .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to finish with them to finish their epi@@ c mission .
we don &apos;t have that very simple life in real life , and this sen@@ sation that if you listen to sleep , you end up being ready to sleep .
and also there is this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story , why we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level a level &quot; and &quot; four@@ 1 strength &quot; or &quot; four@@ -@@ 1 &quot; .
this const@@ ant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in the real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have 25@@ 1 minutes , and i have 25@@ -@@ ko@@ t idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i &apos;m not going to get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of co@@ operation online worl@@ ds like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be at the edge of a kind of epi@@ c , that we &apos;re going to spend all of our time in these game worl@@ ds .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
up to today , all the world of war@@ cra@@ l players have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years to solve the virtual problems of a@@ er@@ tis@@ osau@@ re .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it may sound mis@@ er@@ able .
but to look at it in context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago , our first pri@@ mate ancestors began to go up@@ right .
so the first exciting prime pri@@ mate is .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend play on play , it makes sense just when you consider time in terms of the size of human development , which is extremely extraordinary .
but also , it &apos;s appropriate , because it turns out that by using all this time , we actually change what we are as human beings .
we &apos;re developing into collabor@@ ative thinking , heart cre@@ ature .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that &apos;s what i think .
and if you look at this interesting stati@@ stic , which is recently published by a resear@@ cher of car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university , the average young man of today is spending 10,000 hours with online television culture in a country with a 21@@ st century age .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , there are 10@@ ,000 hours of a wide variety of time that they spend at school , from fif@@ th grade to the end of high school , when you &apos;re never missing .
so we have a total par@@ all@@ el process , where young people learn exactly what it means to be a good player , like anything else that they learn in school .
and maybe some of you may have read the new book by mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; head@@ -@@ fl@@ at@@ ers . &quot;
so , you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cogni@@ tive science that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the ni@@ gh@@ test college to the u.k. , we &apos;re going to be ma@@ sters in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever is the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are ma@@ sters .
so the big question is , &quot; what is the game of ma@@ ster@@ -@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted ? &quot;
because if we could find that out , we &apos;d never have to have a decision before there was no human potential there .
so many people we have now in the world who spend at least an hour a day with online games .
this is our ma@@ ster@@ -@@ player . 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever .
and , you know , if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game level industry evol@@ ves that save energy and work on mobile networks rather than the broad@@ band internet , so players all over the world , especially in india , china , to play brazil online .
you &apos;d expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
that &apos;s where we have 1.@@ a billion billion players .
and so i started thinking about what it is that we &apos;re making these games in our hands .
here are the four things i &apos;ve found . first of all , vulner@@ ability optimis@@ m .
ok , think about it as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation .
per@@ per@@ ability optimis@@ m is desire to do something immediately , to master a bar@@ rier , along with the belie@@ fs that we have a reas@@ on@@ ed hope on success .
player always belie@@ ves that a epi@@ c is possible , and it always wor@@ ries trying to do it , and it always makes it happen .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are ma@@ sters in the spi@@ ders po@@ et , more social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting investi@@ gation that shows us that we may like people to play after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve dec@@ lin@@ ed us .
and the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with anybody &apos;s game .
we trust that somebody has a time with us , that the rules are going to be stopped , that we have the same goal and we stay to the end of it .
so the combin@@ ation of collaboration is to grow from ser@@ ves , trust and with each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stron@@ ger social relationships .
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of war@@ m player plays 22 hours a week , sort of a part@@ time job .
and the reason is , when we play , we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier in getting hard than if we rela@@ x@@ ate or do nothing .
we know that we &apos;re going to work as human beings , if we do hard , meaning@@ ful work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , ep@@ angel@@ ical meaning .
gam@@ ers love to become part of the world &apos;s room , to become part of the land .
this is a back@@ right frame@@ work to pull that into the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the greatest wi@@ ki of the world .
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 comm@@ ents , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
five million people are using it every month .
they &apos;ve put more information about the world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other issue in every other wi@@ ki of the world .
they have a epi@@ c story .
it gives you an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
ok , so that &apos;s four super@@ power@@ s that lead to a single out@@ come . players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as an individual .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worl@@ ds , but not the real ones .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
ed@@ ward ca@@ kol@@ o@@ va is a number scientist .
his work is a@@ wes@@ ome . he exam@@ ines why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to color not less than a mass user migra@@ tion in virtual worl@@ ds and online play environments . &quot;
and this is from an econom@@ ist . so he &apos;s logi@@ cal .
and he &apos;s saying ...
not as i -- i play games , i &apos;m a little bit more f@@ loo@@ dy .
so he says that actually makes sense , because player can reach more in online worl@@ ds than it is in real life .
they can hand@@ le more powerful social inter@@ actions than in real life . they get more feedback and re@@ wards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s perfectly logi@@ cal at the moment that player has more time in the virtual world than in real situations .
i agree , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
but it &apos;s definitely not a opti@@ tic situation .
we need to begin to transform the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , which is back for 2,@@ 500 years .
there &apos;s these ancient cu@@ be , made out of she@@ et@@ les . do you know ?
in front of these amazing game controll@@ ers , there were she@@ pher@@ d she@@ as .
and these were kind of the first of people designed games equipment .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the tas@@ ks of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ i@@ ist her@@ p@@ ot@@ us , you may know this story . the story of how and why games have been invented .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us games , they &apos;ve invented a special game in the king@@ dom of the king@@ dom of fam@@ ine .
now there was such a great fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ di@@ es was a crazy idea , which was a crazy idea .
the people suff@@ ered . people f@@ ought .
it was an extreme situation . you had to have an extreme solution .
so they invented , you know , her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the box game and applied a national strategy , a day you &apos;d eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be lo@@ cked so much in the box game , because games are so fascinating , and they surro@@ unded us with satis@@ ble , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , that they would forget nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you &apos;d play . and the next day you would eat .
and for 18 years , swa@@ od@@ ot@@ us survi@@ ved for 18 years of having this fam@@ ine by working on one day and the next one playing .
equ@@ ally , i think we &apos;re going to let you play games today .
we &apos;re going to play play to solve the suffering of the real world .
we make a game to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that doesn &apos;t work in real life , and we take ourselves what we need to play out of .
but this is not what needs to be the end .
that &apos;s a curious thing .
and her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , according to 18 years , became the fam@@ ine of fam@@ ine , so the king decided to make a last ch@@ ore game .
and they divi@@ ded the king@@ dom in two .
they played a box game , and they had allowed them to break into a terri@@ cal ad@@ vent@@ ure .
they left the ly@@ di@@ es , and they started looking for a new home , and they just dro@@ pped back as many people , as they had survi@@ ved for survival to survive , and they looked at the rest of the world in which they could thri@@ ve .
sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but the lat@@ est dna evidence indi@@ c@@ ates that the e@@ tr@@ or , which later formed the pi@@ m@@ al king@@ dom , the same dna as the ancient ly@@ di@@ ans .
and so scientists recently came up with the notion that her@@ o@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy story came true .
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of a global cool@@ ing , which took almost 20 years to explain what the fam@@ ine was going to explain .
so this crazy story could be vot@@ ed .
they may actually have saved their people through play by doing 18 years in games , and then they had this agre@@ ement and they learned so much about each other that they had saved all the civilization .
so this is what we can do .
we &apos;ve been playing since 199@@ 4 war@@ craft .
this was the first strategy in the real world of war@@ cra@@ fing series , and it was 16 years ago .
they played a hand@@ le for 18 years , we played war@@ craft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready to play for our own epi@@ c game .
so , they sent away half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion play hours per week .
we should over@@ date that half of us spend an hour per day with play , until we solved the problems of the physical world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask me , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly the question that i &apos;ve been encoura@@ ging my work for the last few years in the world .
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it tells us how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to be able to tell the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to introdu@@ ce the best conclu@@ sion , and then we em@@ power people to be able to imple@@ ment this idea in reality .
we &apos;re going to introdu@@ ce ar@@ gical vic@@ tory and give people the possibility of reach@@ ing them .
i &apos;m going to show you just a little bit three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and give people an epi@@ c of epi@@ c in their own future .
this one is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game , where you have to over@@ come a degre@@ it of oil .
the oil sc@@ ar@@ city is invented , but we have enough online content to be reali@@ stic for you , and you have enough living content , so , if you sign into play , say where you live . and then you get news mes@@ sages in real time . so , if you get into play , say where you live . and then you have to figure out how they &apos;re going to form their real life , what they &apos;re not , how much oil it is , whether it &apos;s true , and you &apos;re asking them to blog@@ ge to blog@@ ging videos , if it was true , and you &apos;re asking them to pay videos or images to help us .
we &apos;ve te@@ sted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve achie@@ ved it for over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transforma@@ tive experience .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a terri@@ cal ad@@ vent@@ ure and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure that you &apos;re going to carry on .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have gotten the ones in the game that they &apos;ve seen .
so for the next world game , we &apos;ve got a bigger , higher goal than just oil sc@@ ar@@ city .
we &apos;ve evolved &quot; super@@ fi@@ stics &quot; at the institute for the future for the future .
the point here is that the compu@@ tation of a super@@ computer is that the people have only left 23 years on the planet .
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global extin@@ ction -- &quot; of course , as well as global extin@@ ction .
the call to the player , to challenge it , we almost created like a &quot; jer@@ r@@ y-@@ bal@@ ck@@ heim &quot; film .
you know , jer@@ ry tal@@ ck@@ book films , where there are the &quot; f@@ ame team &quot; -- they have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ be@@ ater , and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , let &apos;s say everybody is in the cam@@ let team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ thousand players played the play for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they goo@@ gl@@ ed &quot; super@@ fi@@ ct . &quot;
and the last game we &apos;re going to do on the 3@@ rd of mar@@ ch . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you close the game , you get a publi@@ cation of social net@@ amp ; d in 2010 .
we work with universi@@ ties all over the south africa , and invi@@ te them to learn social transforma@@ tion .
we have a com@@ ic thing . we have &quot; level high &quot; for regi@@ onal understanding , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity .
i &apos;d like to invi@@ te you all to share this game with young people around the world , particularly in the field of develop@@ s that benefit from them , including its own social enter@@ pris@@ es , to save the world .
i &apos;m going to go to the end .
i want to ask you a little bit .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
we &apos;ve got all these amazing players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope you &apos;ll agree with me that the player is human resources , which we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have these kinds of super@@ power@@ s , good produ@@ c@@ tivity produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to attra@@ ct open social networks , per@@ per@@ ability optimis@@ m and the desire for epi@@ ic signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce .
i really hope we play meaning@@ ful games to survive on the planet a further century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to play with me like this , and play with me .
now , when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure i can make two things : that we can create any imag@@ in@@ able future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i &apos;m going to say , let &apos;s start the world &apos;s worldwide game !
thank you so .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what i was writing a couple of months ago by writing an article for itali@@ an parti@@ tion .
i always jo@@ ined my syn@@ ony@@ mous call dic@@ tion@@ ary , but i &apos;ve done a job with the tex@@ ture already , and i noticed that i never looked at the text in my life , which is what the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; really meant .
i &apos;m going to tell you the introdu@@ ction .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , &quot; ad@@ je@@ ctive : &quot; s@@ mil@@ ing , hel@@ pl@@ ess , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ eless , destro@@ y , s@@ mu@@ d@@ ged , la@@ king , de@@ dic@@ ated , s@@ mu@@ d@@ ged , s@@ mu@@ d@@ ged , s@@ mu@@ d@@ ched , li@@ g@@ gling , gl@@ ori@@ ous sen@@ ks , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , hand@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ shel@@ f , ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ated , s@@ ni@@ ping , wa@@ king , wa@@ king , wa@@ king , wa@@ king , wa@@ king , wa@@ sty , wa@@ sty , wa@@ sty , wa@@ ky , verti@@ h .
healthy : healthy , strong , decisi@@ able . &quot;
i read this list of a friend listen@@ er , and i had to lau@@ gh , it worked so ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but i just came to speak , and i couldn &apos;t speak on , and i had to stop reading , and i would go to sleep , and i would go back and collect me after this over@@ -@@ of-@@ your@@ -@@ hand@@ ed wor@@ ge , and with this stir@@ red emotional sho@@ ck .
of course , it was a popular , old syn@@ ony@@ mous , dic@@ tion@@ ary , and i just thought the paper has to be a pretty old job .
but in fact , it was a paper in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , when i was just beginning to build element@@ ary school , and i started to build my self-@@ image from my famil@@ y-@@ family zone and to form , also in terms of other kids and to the rest world around me .
and , thank god , i don &apos;t have a syn@@ ony@@ mous call dic@@ tion@@ ary at that time .
if i take this case seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would percei@@ ve me as a person whose life , whose life could be positive . now , i &apos;m going to argue for the od@@ ds and ad@@ vent@@ ure that i &apos;ve ever experienced .
so i immediately came up with the online out@@ put of 2009 , and i expected to find a speech account here .
and here is the current version of this in the process .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not a much better thing .
in particular , the last two words , under &quot; ada@@ ren@@ dar@@ y &quot; is &quot; full &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and the way we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ ler , have really believed that the emergen@@ cy language of a flight is a great force , because what you &apos;re talking about is mani@@ pul@@ ating , too , mani@@
so , what do we really want to recognize mani@@ fest -- a dis@@ ab@@ led person or a powerful human being ?
just as a human being called a child , they may be able to push them up , push them up and over@@ drawing them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice , to open up do@@ ors ?
a person who opened for me do@@ ors was my pe@@ ti@@ sts at a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ ann institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton in dolph@@ ons .
it &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ o . a it@@ it@@ o americans whose name , as you can imagine , most americans couldn &apos;t solve cor@@ rec@@ tly , so he was always called dr. p@@ . &apos; .
and dr. p@@ . hat@@ s were very color@@ ed , and she was just doing for kids like creating kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my physi@@ cal therapy .
i had to re@@ build individual practic@@ es , and i had to re@@ se@@ min@@ ate with these big , el@@ a@@ ks , in different colors -- that you know to build my leg mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed these ta@@ gs more than anything else , and i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed it . i hat@@ ed it .
and just imagine that , in fact , as a five-@@ year-old child with dr. p@@ . exer@@ cis@@ es , and trying to stop these practic@@ es , naturally without success .
and one day he looked at me on one of my practic@@ es -- these practic@@ es were just ti@@ ring and sc@@ or@@ t@@ less@@ ly -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful , young girl , you &apos;ll some@@ day cr@@ ush one of those b@@ ars .
and if you &apos;re going to do it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , this was just a simple trick from dr. p@@ . so i do the practic@@ es that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the conc@@ ern that the rich@@ est of five year-old girls in the department , but he actually brought me to see my daily practic@@ ed hor@@ ror with new eyes , and so he actually managed to see a new and a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad experience .
and i wonder@@ ed how much of his vision of me as big and powerful young girls have sha@@ ped my self-@@ image , and i could imagine that i could find myself as one of nature from strong , powerful and at@@ le@@ th@@ ic human .
this is just an example of many , many , like adults in power posi@@ tions can address the imagination of a child .
but just as those of the examples of syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ aries exi@@ sting us , our language doesn &apos;t give us a room to imagine what we would want to all wish to do : to see every single person to see themselves as a powerful human being .
our language is based on social change that have been em@@ bed@@ ded in many cases by a technologi@@ cal change .
from the medical stand@@ point , you can tell , of course , that my legs , the las@@ er surgery for visu@@ ation , k@@ k@@ ul@@ a , of ti@@ tan@@ ous music writing , which allow people to really use their possibility , and across the boundar@@ ies that allow them to really develop their natural dest@@ in@@ y to develop out , at least not to speak from social net@@ working plat@@ forms , people en@@ ab@@ led themselves not to speak from social net@@ worked , people en@@ able themselves to define their identity in their own way , and to ori@@ ent it around the world to groups that they choose .
so maybe the technologi@@ cal change is clear to this technologi@@ cal change , because there &apos;s always another truth , which is that every human society can give something special and very powerful , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt , our biggest stuff is .
the human sk@@ ill adap@@ t@@ ings -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to go around and i &apos;m going to say something : this phr@@ ase has never re@@ f@@ used to me , and i always feel very un@@ comfortable to ask people &apos;s questions , and i always think that &apos;s why i understand why .
this is a sentence from dealing with en@@ dur@@ acy with the idea that success or happiness depen@@ ds to be a challenge without by caus@@ ing a challenge , not by the associated experience , as if my life was so successful , because i could take the potential case of a pro@@ s@@ thetic , or whatever people have taught me to feel at my dis@@ ability .
but the truth is , of course , that we change ourselves . of course , we &apos;re fac@@ ed by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally or even both of those
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s a good thing .
we &apos;re not a ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to con@@ cur@@ ge to get more familiar with our lives to be aware of our lives
gu@@ il@@ ties just bel@@ ong to our own lives .
and i tend to try and see to see the sha@@ do@@ ws as my sha@@ dow .
sometimes i notice that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s har@@ dly to see , but he &apos;s all over my mind .
and i don &apos;t want to be an impact with this , if you can &apos;t get rid of the spirit of a human &apos;s desire .
there are wi@@ ves in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just all kinds of real , and each person is doing it differently , but the question is not whether we get to be able to deal with them , or not , but how we &apos;re going to get out of it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to avoid doing cour@@ let@@ s@@ uns , but to pre@@ p@@ are them to get good attention to it .
and we don &apos;t enjoy our kids , if we give them the sense that they can &apos;t ada@@ pt .
you have to separate two things : one , to be am@@ pu@@ ted , to be am@@ pu@@ ent , and to the other public opini@@ on of whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
and to be honest , the only real and continu@@ ing that i had to add away with is that the world is constantly meant , she could describe me with these defini@@ tions .
in our desire to protect the people who are at heart , and the cold , hard truth about their disco@@ ver@@ ies , or even the cold truth of the quality of life that they expect , we have to stop looking at that we &apos;re not going to put the out@@ line that someone &apos;s actually dis@@ per@@ tr@@ ented .
maybe this is the present concept that just occur@@ red to what &apos;s going on in a broken , and how we re@@ pair it , for every single dis@@ ability than the path@@ ology itself .
if we don &apos;t treat one person , and we don &apos;t realize all of the forces and the opportunities and the possibility , we become in addition to the natural struggle that you may have to lead to the natural struggle that you may have to carry on , one more
we re@@ fra@@ ct a human who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the pat@@ ology and focus on all the real@@ m of human possibilities .
most important , though , is that there are between the perception of our un@@ intui@@ tions and our great inven@@ tive spirit , there &apos;s a relationship .
we should not inclu@@ de these challen@@ ging times or den@@ ial , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid it , still we should go under the car@@ pet , but it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing the opportunity to recognize the od@@ ds of opportunity .
i may much rather be clear to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to over@@ come eff@@ und@@ ance , but that we &apos;re open , you too , to wra@@ p them up , to wra@@ p it up , to wra@@ p it up , and maybe even dance .
and maybe we &apos;re able to find resili@@ ence as something natural , mix@@ ing and useful and feeling like that through your pres@@ ence .
in this year , we cele@@ br@@ ated the 200 / year birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote evolution 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , is indi@@ cated on something very true in human character .
i would put it in this way , not the most powerful of his species survi@@ ved , and also not the most intelligent of its kind , but the one that can ada@@ pt to change change .
confli@@ cts emer@@ ge creativity .
not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of human minds to survive and to fl@@ our@@ ish , from the struggle of the human spirit , to transform through confli@@ cts .
so again , change and adap@@ tation are the great quali@@ ties of the human being .
and maybe we only know what wood we are about when we really get to be caught .
perhaps that is the sense of wi@@ sh@@ ess , a perception of the iphone , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves a dam@@ n thing .
we can have a new meaning that goes out beyond the time of time .
maybe we can see en@@ dur@@ ance as a change .
there are ways for a change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted yet .
i think the biggest damage we have to protect ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
i mean , you know , who is normal ?
there is no normal thing .
there is the usual . this is typical . but not the normal one . and would you really learn this poor , gra@@ y person really , if you really would have exi@@ sted ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s more .
it would be great if we think of this paradig@@ m of the normal amount of possibilities , or the strength , to deliver it even a little bit more dangerous , and so we can deliver the forces of very much more dangerous , so we can invi@@ te the forces of very many kids , and invi@@ te them to bring their whole value skills into society .
now , what we found from all of our society is that we &apos;ve always challen@@ ged people from the members of our society : useful to be useful and contribu@@ te to participa@@ te .
there is evidence that already the ne@@ anderth@@ als and the ne@@ anderth@@ als have contribu@@ ted older people and people with sever@@ e physical in@@ ju@@ ries , and perhaps this happened , because the life experience of these people has been more likely to live on society survival .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as being broken and us@@ eless ; they became something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a food market in the nor@@ the@@ ast of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing there in front of a sing@@ er to@@ ma@@ te .
and it was summer , and i had a death .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that wasn &apos;t an a@@ wish mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i turn around and i see this older man . i didn &apos;t have a clu@@ e who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know what ? i can &apos;t remember her . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t remember me . &quot;
when i first saw her , i pulled her out of her mother &apos;s bel@@ ly . &quot;
oh , so that &apos;s the thing .
and of course , that &apos;s what it got to click .
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man who i knew just from narra@@ tives of my mother about this day , because of course , i was definitely , i was in my birthday for two weeks .
the doctor for pr@@ aus@@ at@@ al diagno@@ stics of my mother was in vac@@ ation , so my parents suff@@ ered the man who brought me back to the world at all .
and because i was born without a wa@@ de legs , and i had my feet in front of them , and i just had a few to@@ es on that and some to@@ es at the other foot , he had to get the worse news , the stran@@ gers had to bring the bad mes@@ sages .
he said to me , &quot; i &apos;ve had to tell your parents that you never have ever run , and never as moved as well as other kids , or that you may never live an independent life , and since i &apos;ve never got a dam@@ n lie , you &apos;ve pun@@ ked me . &quot;
what really impres@@ sed me was that he had gather@@ ed time cli@@ ps of my entire childhood , whether if i had ele@@ cted a letter competition in the second grade in the second grade , whether i had spent my sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship or one of my spor@@ ts in the par@@ ade , whether i had my sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship or one of my spor@@ ts , to teach his students , the students of the ha@@ h@@ man medical school , the her@@ s@@ hey of medical school and the her@@ s@@ hey medical school .
and he called this part of his clas@@ ses to the x possible , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t scale enough to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze how essential this factor can be for human quality of human quality .
and dr. ke@@ an told up , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they haven &apos;t had anything else , and even if they get a bit of help , when you get kids , kids can reach a lot . &quot;
you see , dr. ke@@ an has changed his thinking .
he understood that medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone rel@@ ates with it , are two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve changed my thinking over time , if you &apos;ve asked me at the age of 15 , whether i had broken my pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics against legs of meat and b@@ ones , then i won &apos;t have a second .
i didn &apos;t want to be normal at the time .
now , if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
and perhaps this change could happen , because i was approach@@ ed so many people who have opened me do@@ ors , rather than trying to find people who wanted me to con@@ vul@@ se or over@@ se@@ er me a picture .
see , it really takes one person who shows you how they can mani@@ fest their forces , and they are through .
if you allow someone to activ@@ ate their own intern@@ al forces -- the human spirit is so re@@ com@@ men@@ ded -- if you &apos;re doing it , and you &apos;re opening a door for somebody in a very critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them to open up their own do@@ ors .
the actual meaning of the word &quot; the web &quot; is roots in the word &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to build something that is in one way , to s@@ hr@@ ink the potential .
again , what kind of potential do we want to call up ?
in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , a case study was condu@@ cted in the u.k. , and then green@@ bel@@ n@@ ands were trans@@ formed in a whole range of schools .
they call this &quot; foun@@ da@@ ctive &quot; in the united states , we call it as &quot; wind . &quot;
students are divi@@ ded for gra@@ des .
and the one of the students are getting more sever@@ e , they get better teachers , and so on .
they then gave over a three-@@ month period of students with a &quot; mon@@ th@@ est &quot; -- they said they were very clever , they said they were very clever , and after those three months they had really written their hands .
and of course , it blocks you to hear the heart that surro@@ ws the lon@@ ent students , they &apos;re just suff@@ i@@ cient .
and of course , it was the same after the three months .
but only the ones that were still in school -- except by the students who had closed school .
in fact , in this study , the teachers weren &apos;t dec@@ lin@@ ed .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something changed was changed .
they were just told that they were the student students , and they are the students with the kid@@ pi@@ m , and they teach them something , and they encoura@@ ged them .
the only real dis@@ ability is a blan@@ k spirit , which is broken , doesn &apos;t have hope anymore . he doesn &apos;t find more hope . he doesn &apos;t find much more ; he doesn &apos;t find our natural , happy curi@@ osity , and our de@@ dic@@ ate ability to imagination .
but if we manage to encoura@@ ge the human spirit , to continue to find ourselves , to hope , to ourselves and other people around them , we really give our forces to become positive , and we &apos;re really positive to
if a spirit is about these quali@@ ties , we can create a new reality and new func@@ tion@@ ing form .
i want to end with a po@@ em that is em@@ bed@@ ded by a per@@ si@@ an po@@ et called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , which my friend jac@@ ques for@@ bo@@ is tells me , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god , who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows god , not the god of the name , but the god , who only knows four words , not the god of the comm@@ and@@ ment , &quot; always said , dance with me . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re currently right now ?
suppose , i said , through a few changes of your genes , a better memory may have a better memory -- pre@@ cise , more faster and faster .
or do you want to be more resili@@ ent , more stron@@ ger , more power@@ s .
do you want to become more attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ c@@ ant ?
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those cases that always en@@ vy for more creativity .
which would they enjoy the most ?
which would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity , creativity .
how many people would choose to vote creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a couple . probably about as many people there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose to decide for a good memory ?
there &apos;s a few more .
now , how about fit@@ ness ?
a few fewer ones .
so , what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
oh , the majority . i like to see the doctor as a doctor .
if you could have one of those , it would be a very different world .
is this all just inten@@ tion@@ ing ?
or is it possible to happen ?
evolution is a continu@@ ing top@@ ic here at the ted conference , but today i &apos;d like to give you the idea of a physi@@ cian to the subject .
the great gene@@ tics in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a develop@@ er in russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , wrote a paper , wrote , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t matter any sense except in the evolution of evolution . &quot;
now , if you are one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good moment of time to switch your audi@@ ences , take your personal communic@@ ations -- i give you per@@ mission -- and maybe you can take a look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos; book , which is about being wrong , because nothing else in the rest of the talk will make sense for you .
but if you accept biological evolution , it &apos;s just about the past , or is it about the future , or is it about the future ?
is it true for others , or is it available to us ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve placed a bush as a center of comp@@ ani@@ on in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , all exi@@ sting speci@@ ally , all exi@@ pher@@ s on the top of those bran@@ ches have succe@@ e@@ ded in evolutionary terms : they survi@@ ve ; it has been shown ; it demo@@ mar@@ ish@@ ed its environment and strength .
the human part of this book , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re interested in most of us .
we dou@@ bled from a common ance@@ st@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
in that period of time , maybe 20 or 25 different distin@@ cts of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
some people have come and passed .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it seems as though we &apos;re very separate from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually most of them , the fundamental mechanis@@ ms , our cells are quite the same .
do you realize that we can take advantage of it , and we can budget the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteria , to produce the protein of human insu@@ lin , which is used to treat diab@@ e@@ tic ?
this is not like human@@ insu@@ lin ; this is the same protein that this is chemi@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ differ@@ enti@@ al from what &apos;s coming out of the pan@@ cre@@ ese .
and by talking about bacteria , is that you realize that each of us in our gut is going to lead more bacteria than it leads cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many as a .
i mean , think , if ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o as@@ ks on her self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonder@@ fully hospit@@ al-@@ friend@@ ly animal for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s we@@ ak@@ er , it &apos;s very powerful .
and you &apos;re going to get rid of all the nutri@@ ents that you could just want to buy without your eff@@ or@@ ts .
it &apos;s really a easier way to go to bacteria , with no isol@@ ation inter@@ rup@@ tions of un@@ inten@@ ded , je@@ od@@ ch forced up to the out@@ come .
but still , they &apos;re a wonderful setting for these bacteria , just as they are important for their life .
they help the de@@ for@@ est@@ ation of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to get out in the future ?
are we in some kind of evolutionary balance in a spe@@ z@@ us ?
or are we certainly going to be something else -- something that might even be adap@@ ted to the environment ?
let &apos;s step back to the time of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first follo@@ ws of animal , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first multi-@@ variety organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which has been formed over the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
in this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is very brief , the animal king@@ dom , like a single search , and of human life , a small definition of descri@@ ption .
that &apos;s what we were .
this is also what the privi@@ lege of this talk is , so i &apos;m hop@@ ing that , yes , i liked you .
now , when i was a ni@@ g on college , i had my first bi@@ ological clas@@ ses .
i &apos;ve been fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolutionary evolution , and i discovered something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in a single cell , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will further in both other to@@ ods of the cell .
but at the time , as a majority of organisms aro@@ se , things began to change .
so , sexual re@@ production is in the image .
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production , which is the genome , the rest of the body will be avo@@ i@@ ded .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ table of the death of our body in evolution is at the same moment as sexual re@@ production .
now , i have to say , if i was a college student , i thought fine , i thought , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reas@@ on@@ ably at that moment , but every year , it &apos;s gotten to my increas@@ ed dou@@ bt .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , which in las v@@ eg@@ as introduced his show in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .
and one night , there &apos;s a ta@@ pe on his hotel door .
and he op@@ ens the door .
this is a beautiful rou@@ te of sho@@ w@@ boy , which is a beautiful lo@@ ck .
she looks at him and he says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ -@@ sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
i came up with the insi@@ ght as a doctor that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily confli@@ ctive , just different .
i &apos;ve tried to preser@@ ve the body .
i wanted to keep a healthy loss .
i wanted to repe@@ at the health after a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the rise of the genome to the next generation , custom@@ i@@ zation and the generation of generation to generation .
from a evolutionary stand@@ point , you and i , like bo@@ ster rock@@ ets , to send the genetic focus into the next stage of the orbit , and then drop it down to the ocean .
i think we would all be able to understand the mo@@ od of all the al@@ dy people , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach im@@ mortality through my work .
i &apos;m going to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution is not inevi@@ table to pre@@ fer the lon@@ gest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily toler@@ ate the biggest , the stron@@ gest , or the l@@ ung@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
evolution is pres@@ ented with the creatures that are best adap@@ ting to its environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survi@@ vation and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that are ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and so if fish were there , if fish were there , there would be vac@@ u@@ um fish at the end , yet they &apos;ve managed to make it a vi@@ able environment .
so , what does this mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolutionary evolution , and most importantly , as we anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the next phase , i would argue that there are a number of possibilities .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to continue to evol@@ ve .
we have achie@@ ved some kind of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
and the reason that it would be that most of us have been through medicine , managed to recei@@ ve a lot of genes that otherwise had been sel@@ ec@@ ted and out of the population itself .
and second , we as a spe@@ z@@ ie have so con@@ fig@@ red to our environment that we &apos;ve made it to ada@@ pt exactly as we ada@@ pt to them , and we ada@@ pt to them .
and by the way , we &apos;re killing and cir@@ cul@@ ating and making us so much that they can &apos;t say that isol@@ ation is necessary for the evolution to find the status .
a second way is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional species , of course , to be driven by the forces of nature .
and the argument is that this would slowly be re@@ stor@@ ed by evolution , but they &apos;re in@@ san@@ ta@@ tion@@ arily .
and as far as the isol@@ ation occur@@ s , when we look at planet africa as a species , there will be insu@@ lation , and the changes of the environment , that can produce evolution in natural ways .
but there is a third opportunity to be a more comp@@ elling , fascinating and sc@@ ary opportunity .
i &apos;m going to call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just natural , but ultimately , and we decided to be as individual as individuals in the decisions that we &apos;re making .
now , how could this have happen ?
how could it be possible for us to do this ?
well , let &apos;s look at the reality that the people today , in some cultures , are making decisions about their off@@ spring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the person and the family decide .
so remember , if it &apos;s not only possible to vote the gender of your child , but also to adop@@ t the body genetic adap@@ tations that would cure disease and prevent disease .
what if they could make genetic change to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or elimin@@ ate the risk of cancer , or the stro@@ kes ?
and would you like to make these changes in your genome ?
when we think about it , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13@@ 13 years .
and it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the following year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in the ti@@ ll four months .
today , you can exp@@ and a sequence of the three billion base pair of the human genome to a price of about $ 20@@ ,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take more time until the reality is going to be the 1,000 human genom@@ es , and it &apos;s increasingly going to be available for everybody .
a week ago , the national acade@@ my of engineering , the dra@@ per prize for fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ mmer , two scientists , who have developed independent metho@@ ds that encoura@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to des@@ ir@@ able proteins in a efficient way -- which fran@@ ces ar@@ n@@ old calls &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the las@@ er prize explor@@ ed scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an adult body , a fi@@ ber , and through the manipu@@ lation of only four indi@@ pher@@ es , the cell infe@@ cted to take them to a plu@@ ri@@ po@@ tent stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially is able to become any cell in your body .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that the human insu@@ lin in bacteria can produce viruses , which is not just defen@@ ding freedom from itself , but also to serve imm@@ unity with other viruses .
believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study in the end of v@@ acc@@ a to be built into the cells of a to@@ oth plant that &apos;s built into the cells of a to@@ oth plant .
can you think a little good thing that comes from to@@ bac@@ co ?
this is all reality today , and it &apos;s going to be much more possible in the future today .
now , think of just two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells of their wal@@ ks ?
what if they could change the sper@@ m and the eg@@ g , or the fro@@ g , ferti@@ li@@ cally , to give their children a better chance for a heal@@ thi@@ er life -- elimin@@ ate diabetes , elimin@@ ate cro@@ m@@ ma , reduce risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to get heal@@ thi@@ er kids ?
and then the analy@@ tical technology , the same motor of science that can allow change to avoid disease , could also allow us to adop@@ t disease , to adop@@ t , hyper@@ -@@ capacity , hyper@@ -@@ capacity -- the better memory .
why not have the per@@ mission of a bla@@ m jen@@ n@@ ings , especially if you can exp@@ and it with the next generation of the wat@@ er machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ bers that are going to allow you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer life life ?
they &apos;re going to be ir@@ ras@@ si@@ ble .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it forward to the next generation , and we can publi@@ sh the at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want , we &apos;re trans@@ formed by al@@ s-@@ style evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that may last require 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it for a thousand years -- and maybe even for the next 100 years .
these are decisions that you have to deal with , or your grand@@ children , or your grand@@ children , to deal with .
are we using these decisions a society that is better , the more successful , that is more friend@@ ly ?
or are we going to choose sel@@ ec@@ tively different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want to have , and not for other people ?
are we going to form a society more inclu@@ ded and re-@@ for@@ dered , or more rob@@ ust and more el@@ ev@@ ate ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to be meeting .
and most deep@@ est of all , are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these choices ?
in good ways like the evil , and early as you may think , these decisions are going to be on us
so thank you .
i want you to imagine a little bit now , a port@@ able robot , which gives you human quality skills , or another , the wheel@@ quar@@ ters of wheel@@ quar@@ ters helping you stand up and go back .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics , we call this robot ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ar .
they &apos;re nothing else than something you put in the morning , and it gives you extra strength , and it &apos;s going to increase your speed , and it &apos;s going to help you to keep care of it .
and in fact , this is the real speed of man and machine .
but it &apos;s not just that -- it &apos;s mel@@ ting and conne@@ cting them with the universe and other devices out there .
now this is not just a crazy idea .
so , in order to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re going to start talking about the american soldiers who dro@@ ve at the average about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s a question that you should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- spin@@ al in@@ j@@ ury , 30 percent of it -- chr@@ onic feed@@ in@@ ju@@ ries .
so we thought that we would take ourselves this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help us deal with this problem .
so , let me introdu@@ ce you now h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human source car@@ rier .
sol@@ d@@ at : with the h@@ ul@@ c ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can wear 200 pounds across different ter@@ rain , a lot of hours .
so his flexi@@ ble design en@@ ables you to diver@@ t deep , to warm , to get f@@ at@@ -@@ ben@@ ch@@ able mov@@ ements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then raise my strength and de@@ ad@@ line .
we &apos;re going to introdu@@ ce on our industrial part@@ ners of this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , this year .
so , it &apos;s true .
let &apos;s look at our vie@@ ws on the wheel@@ quar@@ ters , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 6@@ 8 million people who are esti@@ ma@@ ted in the wheel@@ chair in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population population .
and indeed , this is a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young individuals with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury , living in the l@@ ength of their life -- 20@@ 0s , &apos; 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- and the wheel@@ chair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , its number multi@@ pli@@ f@@ ted .
and it &apos;s kind of the only option -- when it comes to the brain , or for other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since what i &apos;m saying to say , very success@@ fully .
so we thought that we could begin to write a whole new chap@@ ter in mo@@ bility .
let me show you now , ele@@ gs , which is car@@ ried by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel , who had a spin@@ al market@@ in@@ j@@ ury , which is the out@@ come that they couldn &apos;t go to work for 19 years and so on .
thanks very much .
as i said , am@@ anda is our char@@ gs .
it &apos;s got sensor@@ s .
his total non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s in the pen , the signals behind our on@@ bo@@ ar@@ d computer , which is wra@@ pped on the back of the line .
there &apos;s also bat@@ ter@@ y-@@ pac@@ ks , and the motor drive is going to be on its hi@@ ps , as well as your k@@ nee jo@@ ys , which you &apos;re moving forward in this rather , very natural and very natural property .
i was 24 years old , and in my form , when a mon@@ bald tree was paraly@@ zed by a sk@@ et@@ ch of sk@@ ots .
in a fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every feeling , and every movement underneath my be@@ ars .
not long after@@ wards , a doctor in my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;ll never go back . &quot;
and this is 19 years ago .
he &apos;s a foot of every five-@@ minute experience out of my consciousness .
adap@@ t@@ ability technology has allowed me to learn to go back to sk@@ i , to clim@@ b , to clim@@ b and even drive with the hands of it .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again , until now .
thanks very much .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet and to disc@@ uss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here , to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or am@@ anda here , and all the wheel@@ chair workers , but for everybody .
thanks very much .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a m@@ ess of the develop@@ mental organization of a non-@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin force .
if i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i wel@@ f@@ end as an help of a fire@@ man master &apos;s pur@@ ch@@ ase on a volunte@@ er de@@ fe@@ ct the fire .
well , in our city , in which volunte@@ ers spon@@ sor@@ ed a highly sophisti@@ cated professional fire eleph@@ ant , you have to be very early in order to be able to participa@@ te .
and i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunte@@ er in the jung@@ le , so i had a good opportunity to be able to get there .
but it was still a dis@@ connect against the other volunte@@ ers to reach the volunte@@ er man , and find out what our tas@@ ks would be .
when i first found the main man , he was in a very serious conversation with the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the bedro@@ ttle and bar@@ s@@ foot under a ch@@ ute out of a wall , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunte@@ er who came in front of me was -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- and let &apos;s call him the main man as first , and became asked to go to the house and save the dog of the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds .
the dog ! i was very lucky at the time .
there was anybody who was a law@@ yer or a corpo@@ rate leader , who is now for the rest of his life , telling people that he went into a burning house to save a living , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the main man kee@@ ps me to get me .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you have to go to the house . &quot;
you have to go up , you have to go up the fire , and you &apos;ve got to get a few shoes . &quot;
i &apos;m swe@@ asing it .
now , not exactly what i hop@@ ed to do , but i went down -- the sta@@ irs went up , down the floor , the real fire@@ men , who at that moment had been so u@@ tter@@ ly finished , getting into the bedro@@ om to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking about now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i wor@@ e back to the bottom , where i met my mind and my belo@@ ved dog , and my belo@@ ved dog .
we put our esti@@ mates out to the school ow@@ ners , where , not surpris@@ ingly , he had gotten much more attention than mine .
a couple of weeks later , the fire ele@@ ction received a letter of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , where she would pick up her house for res@@ cu@@ e her hou@@ su@@ ship .
one of all sudden kin@@ dness : somebody had a pair of shoes : she even gave her a pair of shoes .
in my job with ro@@ bin &apos;s strength , as well as my asi@@ de , as a volunte@@ er fire@@ man , i &apos;m wit@@ n@@ essed gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness in great scale , but i also see the relationship of the relationship and the mu@@ ce of individuals .
and do you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i see myself in this room , and i see people who either have an indi@@ cation success , or on her way , i want to ask this memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in another way , until you &apos;ve reach@@ ed your first million dollars .
if you have something to give you something , you &apos;ll give it right now .
put it in a cycle kitchen , kitchen it up in the neighborhood .
be a ment@@ or .
not every day will be a chance to save the lives of a human &apos;s life , but every day , every day we give us the opportunity to change one .
so they put it on ; save the shoes .
thanks very much .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mar@@ mark , come back .
thanks very much .
i &apos;ve just come back from a community who knows the secret of the progress of humanity .
a place where women get to the restri@@ ction , with sex &apos; hell@@ o , and the game esti@@ mate the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not a place you &apos;re either or san francisco .
ladies and gentle@@ men , their rela@@ tual relationships .
this is the world of the wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jung@@ ter@@ ies of con@@ go .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are with chimpanze@@ es with chimpanze@@ es our next living rela@@ tives .
that is , we have a common ance@@ stry , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
now , ch@@ im@@ ps are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ city .
but unfortunately , we have this distin@@ ction of dis@@ rup@@ ted in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are showing us the other side of the me@@ d@@ al .
as chimpanze@@ es are done by great , sc@@ ary ball@@ s , the bon@@ o@@ bo society will be em@@ powered by em@@ power@@ ed fe@@ males .
they &apos;ve really come up with this , because this leads to an extremely toler@@ ant society that &apos;s not seen during le@@ th@@ al violence , right now .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least known under the pri@@ mate .
they live in the dep@@ ths of the con@@ gol@@ ese sub@@ forest , and the obser@@ vation is a very heavy warming .
the con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the ar@@ row of a violent ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy that has been wa@@ sting for decades , and almost as many of the lives have requi@@ red as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise the fact that this destruction is also affec@@ ting the survival of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
meat and the de@@ cre@@ ase of the ves@@ lation of the tree is that you can &apos;t even fill up a sta@@ dium with the bon@@ d-@@ hand@@ ed bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even there , we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a bor@@ dry lau@@ gh that the trees will s@@ wal@@ low .
who are those quali@@ ties ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war &quot; mon@@ keys , because they have a bro@@ ad , also bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , with transforma@@ tions , and regu@@ lations such as confli@@ cts and social issues .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s &apos; life is made out of more than kam@@ a su@@ tra .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like people -- love to play their life for a long time .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children &apos;s games .
for us , and it &apos;s fundament@@ ally important for conne@@ ction of relationships and care of toler@@ ance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play incre@@ ases creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behavior , diversity of connections .
and if you look at bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the game , you can see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human sal@@ es , dance and ritu@@ als .
play is the ti@@ p that you &apos;re trying to communicate .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique foot@@ age right away from the wild .
first , a ballo@@ on on bon@@ o@@ bo art -- and i &apos;m not thinking about it foot@@ ball .
so , here we see a young female and men in a pur@@ ch@@ ase game .
take a look at what it &apos;s doing .
that may be the evolutionary orig@@ in of , &quot; you pack it in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
it &apos;s only that i think it &apos;s more like that , right ?
yeah !
so we have sex games , both at bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and in humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ide@@ al wealth , where you get new elements into play -- like the te@@ stes -- and also how the game is challen@@ ging trust -- as it is at the same time , as well as it &apos;s in the same way
but the game is a hand@@ -@@ trans@@ forming .
play is a com@@ modi@@ ty , and there can be a lot of forms , some of which are a little bit harder , fan@@ cy , curious , curious -- maybe just to discover the ast@@ on@@ ishing .
and i &apos;d like to show you , this is the fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she plays pe@@ ac@@ efully with water .
and i think , like you &apos;re still alone , we &apos;re going to play the limit@@ ations of our inner and ou@@ ter worl@@ ds of our inner worl@@ ds
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that lets us explore and interact , and the un@@ expected adap@@ tations that we &apos;re creating are really the world &apos;s e@@ state of creativity .
this is just a little taste of insi@@ ghts , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , our past and present in our past .
but they also also matter a secret to our future , a future where we have to ada@@ pt to more complex challenges , through larger creativity and expensive co@@ operation .
the secret is that the game is the key to this sk@@ ill .
in other words , play is our adap@@ t@@ arian jo@@ ker .
in order to ada@@ pt to an un@@ fortun@@ ate world , we have to play .
but are we going to do the best thing out of our game layer ?
play is not a sil@@ ly game .
it &apos;s essential .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , and people , the life is not for teeth and cla@@ ws alone , and they don &apos;t have life .
at the moment , if it doesn &apos;t seem to be appro@@ ved , maybe play is the most important thing .
and so , my pri@@ mate ma@@ sters , let &apos;s just play this gift of evolution and play together , while we re@@ discover the creativity of the desire and the mar@@ g@@ ard .
so thank you .
i want you to imagine two pa@@ irs , in the middle 197@@ 9 , exactly the same day , every single thing , every single one -- okay .
so , two pa@@ irs , every single one of the baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to take too much time to imagine the product , because , if you think about it all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
so just imagine this for a moment .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , imagine that in a case , the sper@@ m is a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m , which is the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m makes a x chromo@@ some that hits the x chromo@@ some on the x chromo@@ cell .
both of them are survi@@ vable , both of them thri@@ ved .
and we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
and most of my activi@@ ties , i &apos;ve got two hat@@ ches .
underneath a hat , i &apos;m talking about the history of an@@ atom@@ y .
i &apos;m a resear@@ cher histor@@ ist , and in this case , i &apos;m resear@@ ching how people were changing with an@@ atom@@ y -- which is -- human bodies , animal bodies -- how they went through body flu@@ ids , with body concep@@ ts ; how they thought they had thought about bodies .
the other hat that i wear on my work is the activ@@ ist , as a patient graduate student -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient law@@ yer -- of people who are patients of physi@@ cians .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have body types , the social nor@@ ms .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are si@@ am@@ ese tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with g@@ uns -- so people who have been less than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with inter@@ sex people whose gender produ@@ c@@ re -- so people who are not the average male or women &apos;s body types .
and as a universal idea , we can use that word of connec@@ tivi@@ ality .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality is present in a lot of different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of the possible guys that are not the male or the female standard .
in a case , perhaps you have someone with a x@@ y chromo@@ som@@ al-@@ base , and the s@@ ry gene of y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s , the proto@@ bla@@ des that we have all the f@@ ie@@ tal centers , are growing up to te@@ stes .
and that &apos;s why the te@@ stes give up te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one in the fe@@ min@@ al stage .
but because this individual is missing the re@@ cep@@ tors to dete@@ ct the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t re@@ act to te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and this is called and@@ ro@@ gen re@@ cep@@ tor@@ ing de@@ fe@@ ct .
so a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but there &apos;s no reaction to it .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more to the typical female king@@ dom .
when the baby is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s travel@@ ed as girls .
but most of the time it takes the pu@@ ber@@ ty , and they grow their brea@@ ks and they develop , but they don &apos;t get their period until somebody comes to it , is something different here .
and they do a couple of tests , and find out that instead of ir@@ oning s@@ ells and u@@ ter@@ us , they actually have te@@ ars in it , and they have a y chromo@@ some .
it &apos;s important to understand that this person could actually be a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called our bodies that you call ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ ate fr@@ ens .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the next kid@@ ne@@ ys represent and@@ ro@@ gens , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ tive hor@@ mon@@ es .
most women , like me , like me -- i think being a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know what my actual chromo@@ som@@ es are , but i think i probably have the usual -- most women like i speak at the edge of and@@ ro@@ gens .
we &apos;re making it up , and we &apos;re talking about and@@ ro@@ gens .
and the conclu@@ sion is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was more and@@ ro@@ un@@ ced than a woman who was born with te@@ den , and he had a rou@@ te re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
so , gender is really complicated ; inter@@ homo@@ me are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be distribu@@ ted across the range of band@@ wid@@ th .
another one : a couple of years ago , i received the phone call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , and a boy , he had a friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , lived as a man , and he had just discovered that he had a ridi@@ cul@@ e and a u@@ ter@@ us .
he had an extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te side of ni@@ ce hyper@@ bla@@ ction .
he &apos;s got x@@ x chromo@@ some , and in the mother bank , his next kid@@ ne@@ ys were so strong that they basically created a male hor@@ mon@@ ation surro@@ unding .
and con@@ sequence , as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ al male , his brain was ex@@ posed to the usual male part of the hor@@ mon@@ um spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one an@@ dered something .
and only when he became 19 years old , he actually got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was very men@@ d that the doctors found out that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a vari@@ ation of inter@@ homo@@ inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es develop something called o@@ tom est@@ is , where o@@ vari@@ an tissue is ro@@ ot@@ ed by ho@@ sti@@ an tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so , gender can happen in many different var@@ ie@@ ties .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s growing up or it &apos;s grown up , or si@@ am@@ ese tw@@ ins , whether surge@@ ons are often adap@@ ted to the nor@@ m , is not because it &apos;s for its physical health of advantage .
in a lot of times , these people are completely healthy .
and the reason why they &apos;re often introduced to various kinds of sur@@ gical interven@@ tions is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain an@@ atom@@ ic exchange can occu@@ r with a certain identity .
so we have a concept that a woman is to be a female identity ; being a black person , is to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of your own story .
so we have this sort of terri@@ ble simpli@@ stic idea .
and when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually represents something very different to us , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , in terms of this categ@@ ori@@ zing .
so we have a lot of roman@@ tic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism .
and our nation is really based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , that are two individuals in a body .
where i first learned most of the time , the south african run@@ ner in ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , whose gender was challen@@ ged in the world &apos;s gravity in ber@@ lin &apos;s dent@@ al cham@@ pi@@ or .
and a lot of journ@@ alists called me the question , &quot; what are you going to test that we &apos;ve been doing that ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to journ@@ alists that this is not a test that &apos;s going on .
we know now that gender is complicated enough , that we have to ad@@ mit that nature is no place between us between male and female , or with male and inter@@ homo@@ and intellec@@ tu@@ ally , and more inter@@ gender , and more inter@@ homo@@ and inter@@ homo@@ and inter@@ homo@@ them , and more often , we are the ones who con@@ front these divi@@ de as natural .
so we have a situation where , as we continue to continue our science , we have to ad@@ mit that these categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve had for strong an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories , which are very easy to create these very simple ingre@@ di@@ ents , which are very easy to create perman@@ ent identity infe@@ c@@ tors , rather than we &apos;ve imag@@ ined .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true , which is more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has appro@@ ved as our ter@@ min@@ ology .
we were in all kinds of in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent areas .
we &apos;re looking at the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es in common .
what are we going to start with the fact that we just diff@@ er ourselves through a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
as we move forward to our science , we get increasingly into a zone of un@@ comfortable , where we have to realize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories that we have had , probably , are very simple .
we see it in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see this to the p@@ lot , in our culture today , in the united states today , are the struggle over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about what &apos;s going on a body to people , so that he has a different right to live as fe@@ tus .
we have very difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to have never as hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they &apos;d put someone off the nose at the end of the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t bur@@ ned them yet .
if they didn &apos;t move out , they bu@@ ried them .
but today , we are in a situation where we take people to solve vi@@ tal organs , and we want to feed them other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to take care of the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categ@@ ories as we used to have as simple
now you may sus@@ pe@@ ct that all of the categ@@ ories of categ@@ ories would tell somebody how to really make me happy .
i &apos;m a political pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i de@@ f@@ end people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit , it makes me nervous .
understanding that these categ@@ ories are really much more inse@@ cure than we thought , well , i &apos;m excited to get excited .
and it makes me thri@@ ve in terms of consi@@ der@@ ation that democracy is affec@@ ting democracy .
so to tell you about that phr@@ ase , i have to know first that i &apos;m a great fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
i know they were law@@ sed , i know they were more sex@@ i@@ ous , but they were great .
i feel that they were so ta@@ st@@ le and strong , and so radical , where they were doing me that i would find all of the many years on the box of the arc@@ ci@@ ful of 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the fo@@ unding fa@@ il@@ ers .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , i think , were the primary an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , which is why it was .
and what she pro@@ posed was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and she brought it through another piece , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years was meas@@ red for us .
as you all remember , our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
the no@@ vers of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
they had a concept of blu@@ e-@@ water .
they were the idea that people who had political power , they should have this political power , because of the local blood line from grand@@ father to the son , to the son , and so on
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers introduced this idea and put it through a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all people were designed equ@@ ally .
they ni@@ ev@@ ed the game field , and they decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , they coun@@ ted common issues , not the differences , and it was very radical .
now they made this part , because they were part of an exc@@ it@@ ance system where two things were growing together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time also the science grew .
and if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , it &apos;s clear that many of you have been very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ alist world .
they went away from expla@@ in@@ ations of super@@ -@@ natural forms , and they pro@@ ved things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where the trans@@ mission is based on a very va@@ sty concep@@ tion of birth@@ right .
and they moved to a moral concept .
and in fact , if you look at the indepen@@ dence of indepen@@ dence , talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they managed to give us a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical commun@@ ali@@ ties .
and so they &apos;re really wonder@@ fully prepared to pre@@ p@@ are the future rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it as well , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after years after ?
for example , women who com@@ pla@@ ased the ele@@ ction , the concept of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , which says that an@@ atom@@ ic common@@ ness is more important than the an@@ atom@@ ical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a dic@@ tion@@ o and ridi@@ cul@@ ous , not meaning , that we should not have the vot@@ ed right , the right to fully govern@@ mental citi@@ zen@@ ship , the law , etc . &quot; etc . &quot;
and women argu@@ ed this success@@ fully .
the next thing is the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like so@@ ws , which is tri@@ ck about me , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the church pla@@ te pla@@ te , which says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are different color , which are based on an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ ali@@ ties of an@@ atom@@ ical distin@@ ctions , again , again .
we see the same thing at the dis@@ ability of law .
of course , the problem is , as we begin to look at all the collective issues , we need to start asking why we think we &apos;re going to take certain numbers out of the world .
now , appreci@@ ated , i &apos;d like to re@@ mind certain conclu@@ sions of an@@ atom@@ ically , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human &apos;s rights .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from an@@ atom@@ y all the way .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds should have the right to get to sex or to mar@@ ry their esti@@ mate .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ical separ@@ ations that make sense to me , and which we think i should stay .
but the challenge is to try to figure out which it is and why we hold it , and whether they &apos;re meaning@@ ful .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been shown at the beginning of the pres@@ entation .
we have two creatures , both of them in 197@@ 9 , at exactly the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , three months earlier , was born , so she was born on the 1@@ 1@@ 80 of 19@@ 80 .
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born to the front of the head , so he &apos;s born at the russi@@ an mar@@ ch of 19@@ 80 .
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia has been born three months earlier , they have all kinds of rights three months from h@@ ein@@ rich -- the right sex to choose , to choose , to sell the right , the right to sell .
h@@ ein@@ rich has to wait on all this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the ti@@ me@@ -@@ scale of his birth .
we find even other fra@@ ctions about what their rights are .
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you assu@@ me that he is male -- although i haven &apos;t told you that he is with x@@ y -- because you don &apos;t tell them that he is male , he can now be brought back , which mar@@ ia doesn &apos;t worry about .
mar@@ ia , not in all states , cannot percei@@ ve the same right , which is h@@ lon@@ eless in all states , and that &apos;s the right to mar@@ ry .
h@@ ein@@ rich can be married in every state , a woman , but mar@@ ia can only be married only in a few states .
so we have these ab@@ und@@ ant an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that are proble@@ matic and frag@@ ment@@ ate in many ways .
and to me , the question is , what are we going to do is , what are we going to do , because our science is doing such progress in an@@ atom@@ y , that we &apos;re going to reach a point where a democracy that might be based on an@@ atom@@ y might be ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like the science is going to make sense of itself .
so where are we going to go ?
it appe@@ ars as if our culture is a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic position : &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to pull a line somewhere , so we &apos;ll pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people re@@ f@@ used in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at a point decided that when you get married , texas said that you don &apos;t have y chromo@@ some , and you get married a woman saying you have an o@@ y chromo@@ some .
now in practice , people are not going to be te@@ sted on their chromo@@ sts .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re , because of the story that i mentioned to you earlier about the and@@ ro@@ gens re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
when we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us in his &quot; i have a real solution &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be killing people for &quot; their skin color , &quot; but after the spirit of their character , and it &apos;s about an@@ atom@@ y out there .
and i &apos;d like to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you ju@@ dge people based on their tra@@ der@@ ali@@ ties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of human beings , because i have to ad@@ mit that i know a range of golden re@@ tri@@ ries that probably deser@@ ves soci@@ ations rather than some of the people i know .
i want to argue that i probably know some of the bright lab@@ el dogs , the more capable of being more sophisti@@ cated , more intelligent , smar@@ ter decisions about your sexual relationships than some 40 years that i know .
so , how are we going to operate the question of the character ?
it turns out to be a really difficult thing .
and a part of me wonder@@ ed , what if the content of a person@@ ality is something that would be in the future of machine reading in the future -- is it possible that f@@ mr@@ i &apos;s going to be made ?
do we really want to go into that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going to go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve to make thoughts about the issues of democracy .
in our effort for democracy , we &apos;ve done our work really well , and i think we &apos;d be doing our thing in the future well .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , for instance , in iran , where a man who sen@@ ds sexual to other men , who is pun@@ ished with death to other men , unless he is willing to engage a gender trans@@ action , which is what case he &apos;s going to stay alive .
we don &apos;t exist about these kinds of states .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say that we didn &apos;t have that situation -- a surge@@ on with whom i was talking a couple of years ago , who had brought some si@@ am@@ ese tw@@ ins with them , to separate them together , participa@@ tly to make a name .
but when i typ@@ ed with him , and i asked him why he made these interven@@ tions -- it was high sur@@ ger@@ ies -- was his response that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
and i ans@@ wer@@ ed him , &quot; well , have you ad@@ ded political as@@ yl@@ ale instead of a surgery to separate it ? &quot;
the united states provi@@ des tremendous ways to allow people to be they are , they don &apos;t know they &apos;re going to change the
that &apos;s why i think we have to be leaders .
well , just to finish up , i &apos;m going to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fa@@ thers .
and i &apos;d like to think about the possibility of how democracy might look like , or when we had to participa@@ te more , we &apos;ve had more participa@@ tions .
and i want to say something that is radical for a fe@@ min@@ ist , and i think that there may be a variety of insi@@ ghts , which is that there may be a variety of insi@@ ghts that gover@@ ns from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ y , especially when people are appl@@ ying a group of learning .
and for years , i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in gender terms .
and one of the things that really happened to be interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and interact in the world .
what we have learned from cul@@ ite studies is that women , on average -- not each , but on average -- more often , complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable in the group to give a lot of attention .
and that &apos;s why , when we think about it , we have a very interesting situation .
years years ago , when i took a graduate student , one of my graduate students , who had my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i looked at me as a fe@@ min@@ ist , so i &apos;m going to do it -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what fe@@ min@@ ism is more female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard . &quot;
fe@@ min@@ ism is about elimin@@ ating stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , therefore , at fe@@ min@@ ism , there is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , as more as i thought , that there could be some female in fe@@ min@@ ism .
that is to say , there might be something that is going on on average , where women &apos;s brains from male dist@@ it@@ utes that make us volunte@@ er for complex social rela@@ tions , and volunte@@ ers for prote@@ ction to worry about pollu@@ t@@ ings .
so where the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers have become extremely extreme to figure out how individuals could be prote@@ cted before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more likely to provide a concept , not just how to protect it , but how we might be wor@@ rying for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we do democracy about an@@ atom@@ y -- less than thinking about the individual body , about what identity matters , and thinking more about relationships .
so that , as people , as we try to make a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thanks very much .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to do a very public conf@@ ession , and that is : i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
i love to find every opportunity to find another color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit , and also photograph@@ ing and blog@@ ging and blog@@ ging .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i &apos;m going to get all my clo@@ th@@ es out of the second hand on wo@@ ol@@ roads and in mind hand@@ -@@ hand@@ s-@@ sh@@ ops .
o@@ oh , thank you very much .
mind hand@@ -@@ sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the influence of my gar@@ d@@ ure and also to carry on my wal@@ ital market .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollar produ@@ ces for usual a good deal ; i look quite unique , and it makes me hand@@ le to my full personal search .
i mean , what are i going to find about today ?
is it going to have my size ?
am i going to be like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel like i won .
i &apos;ll come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and tell you what i &apos;ve wra@@ pped for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what are anybody making with so many out@@ f@@ its ?
so i &apos;m going to show you very much what i brought with me .
i brought seven pieces of under@@ pants , and that &apos;s all .
sub@@ ge@@ fing for exactly a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case .
i fir@@ ed that i would find everything i could wear , if i &apos;d come to pal@@ m spr@@ ings to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
and since she hasn &apos;t heard about me as the woman who &apos;s going around her under@@ wear at ted -- that means , i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i &apos;d really like to show you my out@@ f@@ its for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i have , whether you don &apos;t believe it or not , from those ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ers to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start by starting with sun@@ day .
i call it the most fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing dan@@ gers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money in order to see great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , placed me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing this whole week .
mon@@ day : color is a bit of a powerful thing .
it &apos;s almost more physi@@ ological to be mis@@ er@@ able when you wear bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re attra@@ cting other happy people .
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ tation is going to be completely over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life trying to try to be myself , and to ada@@ pt to me at the same time .
just just , who you are .
if they surro@@ und themselves with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it , they &apos;ll value it as well .
we@@ dn@@ ch : hu@@ g@@ ch your inner child .
sometimes people say to me , i looked like i &apos;m playing &apos; clo@@ th@@ es &apos; games , or i remember her to remember her seven year-@@ ol@@ ds .
i &apos;d like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
th@@ ner@@ s@@ day : self-@@ confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost certainly like this .
and if you think you don &apos;t look at something good in something , you probably have to be right .
i grew up with a mother that taught me this day for day .
but it wasn &apos;t until i really became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wra@@ p this short for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and outside a beautiful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there is no exc@@ use for anybody here in this audience .
we should be able to br@@ ink everything we want .
thanks very much .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : gol@@ d-@@ pa@@ il@@ ing all of it .
and finally , satur@@ day : an individual , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world a little bit about you without having to say a word .
it continu@@ ed over and over and over again when i was in this week , just about what i was wearing , just because of what i was wearing , and i had a great conversation .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate it all again .
because the lesson i &apos;ve been trying to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate this stuff , because the way around the corner will always give you another crazy , color@@ ful out@@ fit , which is just waiting for me , when i have a bit love in the heart and search at it .
thank you very much indeed .
thank you very much .
good after@@ noon , everybody together .
i &apos;ve got something i &apos;d like to show you .
so think about this as an image of view , as a fly image .
and this is what we call a useful design in our lab , per@@ cep@@ tual design .
so let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m ini@@ tially itali@@ an , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y is growing up with this image in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that in the for@@ mul@@ a , it happened something very interesting in the last decade or a very interesting thing .
a couple of times ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a , you took your budget and you put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , you need , for example , if you want to win a race , in fact , something like this -- something that &apos;s going on the car in real time , a few thousand sensor@@ s , the information coming out of the system , that information to the system , and then process them , and then use that car choice and distribu@@ te things in real time while information is being colle@@ cted .
this is what you call in engineering teams , a re@@ al-@@ time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system which is made out of two parts -- one is a sen@@ su@@ ing part and a leading end .
what &apos;s interesting today is the re@@ al-@@ time controll@@ er systems begin to emer@@ ge in our lives .
our cities have been em@@ bed@@ ded in the last couple of years , working with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics .
they &apos;re going to be in a free computer .
and as a computer in the open , they begin to re@@ act in other ways , they &apos;re going to be percei@@ ved , and they &apos;re driven .
when we move cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i &apos;d like to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- they cause up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so when we do something about the cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
and beyond the cities , all of these sen@@ ches and em@@ power@@ ing in objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i , for mom@@ a later , was organized a year when the summer was organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; it &apos;s called &quot; w@@ ess with me .
now , all of our objects , our environment , are starting to speak back to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om is going out there to both of them , a sen@@ sor and a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e .
and this is radi@@ cally changing the interaction that we humans have with our environment outside .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o &apos;s dream .
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o wrote the mo@@ se at the end , it says that he took the ham@@ mer at the end , and she war@@ hed him on mo@@ ses -- in fact , they still can &apos;t see a little spot down -- and he said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you just take ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins for the very first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you a couple of examples -- again , with the idea of defin@@ ing our environment and pul@@ ling it .
let &apos;s start with a sense of view .
so , the first project i want to show you is , in fact , one of the first of our lab &apos;s first .
and it was 16 and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and what we &apos;ve done is actually using a new kind of network that &apos;s been put in the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ gan@@ ted information out of this network , which are colle@@ cted to be colle@@ cted by the lab@@ els in order to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was as it@@ al@@ y as it@@ al@@ y &apos;s foot@@ ball cham@@ pi@@ on .
some of you will remember it , it was played as it@@ al@@ y against fr@@ ance , and then at the end of the zi@@ dan@@ e at the end of the head .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y at the end of it .
now , look at what happened this day , only at the obser@@ vation of activity that &apos;s going on in the network .
and here you see the city .
you can see in the middle of the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um , the flu@@ il@@ er &apos;s mind .
the morning , before the game .
you can see the ti@@ mel@@ ine up .
months after@@ wards , people here , and there , who are moving around and moving .
the game starts -- sil@@ g@@ hn@@ ess .
fr@@ ance is making a tor . it@@ al@@ y makes a tor .
hal@@ f-@@ time , people make a short call , go to toi@@ let .
second te@@ d@@ ding . end of the usual game .
first expan@@ sion , second .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in a moment of the head of the head .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
now , at that night , everyone went to the center to celebra@@ te .
they looked at the great ex@@ pos@@ ure .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the se@@ a@@ ver@@ ship team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then they all went down .
and you see the image of the place of micro@@ co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since the case of the tube , people go to celebra@@ te people -- to have a big party , and you can see the out@@ stac@@ ks at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
just very quickly another example of understanding : this is not about people , it &apos;s about things that we &apos;re using and consu@@ me .
now , today we know everything about where we get things .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps where a ma@@ c computer is a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
but we know just a little bit about where things go away .
so we actually designed some small mark@@ ers in this project to pur@@ sue the tr@@ ash while it comes through the system .
so we started working with some volunte@@ ers who have helped us , a little more than a year , in se@@ attle , to tag things that they thre@@ w away -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw away .
we then have the little chi@@ ps , the small br@@ ands , the little br@@ arb@@ ings , and then we start tracking it .
so here are the results that we &apos;ve just gotten .
made from se@@ attle ...
this is after a week .
and with this information , we realized that there is a lot of infe@@ c@@ tivity in the system .
we can actually do the same thing with less energy .
and the data wasn &apos;t available before .
but this happens to be a lot of un@@ healthy weather and complicated things .
the other thing , though , is that we believe that if we see the c@@ up every day , the c@@ up that we throw away doesn &apos;t just disappe@@ ar , that they &apos;re still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day is still hit@@ ting .
and if we were to show people , then we can make a change change change .
so , this is the reason for this project .
my collea@@ gue on mit , as@@ sa@@ f be@@ der@@ man , could give you a lot more about the truth and the many other fab@@ ul@@ ous things you can do with yourself , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we &apos;re discus@@ sing at the beginning , and that &apos;s the em@@ pi@@ ration of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did in span@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in , a couple of years ago .
and it started with a question of the ma@@ yo@@ sters who came to us and said that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition in public places in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that got place at mit was , imagine these pil@@ es and val@@ ves , magnetic magnetic val@@ ks , val@@ ves that open and close and close .
it causes something like a water cur@@ ren@@ cy with ima@@ ging of view of water .
when these images fall down , they can write into patterns , they can write patterns , images , text speak@@ ers .
and you can walk across it , and it &apos;s going to open up and it &apos;s going to open up , as you can see in this picture .
well , we &apos;ve pres@@ ented the ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ hole .
he liked him to do it .
and we got the mission to design a building at the center of the exp@@ o .
we called it to the digital water of the pa@@ ther@@ li@@ on .
the whole building was made out of water .
there are no do@@ ors or windows , but when they &apos;re approach@@ ing it , it &apos;s going to open up and leave it in .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s win@@ win@@ ous , if you want to burn the sy@@ ring@@ es , you can even leave the roof down .
or you could close the building and become the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this day , when you go down the roof , you get pictures of people who are there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building . &quot;
no , they &apos;re not destro@@ ying the building ; it &apos;s just the case that architecture is almost disappe@@ aring .
so , here you see the building works .
you can see the person who &apos;s going to ask what happens inside .
and this is me when i &apos;m looking at the test of the sensor@@ s that open the water , not getting we@@ t
now , i should tell you what happened a night when all of the sensor@@ s stopped to work .
but , in fact , it was an even larger fun at that time .
all the kids from sam@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way she played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to leave them , but a building that would still have blocks and holes in the water , and you had to jump away without getting we@@ t .
and this is , for us , very exciting , because as architec@@ ts , engineers , as designers , we always think about how the people , the things that we design .
but reality is always un@@ predic@@ table to reality .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with the people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical visu@@ als , the ima@@ gery of the water and the proje@@ ctions on it .
and this is what led us to think about the same project that i &apos;m showing you now .
so , imagine this image of ima@@ gery could really start flying .
imagine if you have little heli@@ cop@@ ters that fly through the air , and each one of you with a small image of view with changing light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
so here &apos;s the video .
so , imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one you &apos;ve seen earlier , that moves with other things , totally syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ zed .
you can have these clou@@ ches .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or an ad , like this -- an equal forma@@ tion in two dimensions .
or un@@ regul@@ ate but in three dimensions , where what changes is , the light is not the position of ima@@ ging .
they can play with different kinds of play .
imagine that the screen could just appear in different forma@@ tes or si@@ zes , in different resol@@ ution .
but then the whole one could be just a 3d cloud of images that you can go through and through which you can look through them , which you can look at from many , many direc@@ tions .
and here you see a real fl@@ y@@ -@@ raising control that goes out to form like before an ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly table .
as you turn on the light , it looks like this . so , as we saw it , it looks as much as we &apos;ve seen it .
so , imagine that each one of the people is controlled .
there could be every single piece of ima@@ ging that comes from people from people , from the mov@@ ements of people , or the same .
i &apos;d like to show you something to you first .
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the man@@ pu@@ le at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york , and sc@@ ala in mil@@ il@@ and -- we &apos;ve taken his mov@@ ements in 3d to use them as a di@@ vor@@ ce for the fl@@ y@@ fla@@ pe .
and here you can see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you can see the ima@@ ging of these kinds of beginn@@ ers .
it &apos;s simul@@ tane@@ ously a re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan , and it &apos;s a movement of motion .
so they can re@@ pair the whole movement .
you can do it all the time .
but then , once we have all the ima@@ gery , you can play with it , and with color motion , you can play with it .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
i &apos;d like to show you the lat@@ est project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olymp@@ ics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud . it &apos;s called cloud .
the idea is , again , imagine this that we put together the people in order to do something and change the environment -- almost as something as we call it , to build clou@@ ds of cloud , how to move a scan@@ ner , but with a clou@@ ding cloud .
so , just imagine that everybody can give a small don@@ ation for a target point .
i think that the remarkable one of the ages of events , the last decade is that we &apos;ve moved from a physical world to a digital world .
and all of this has been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , knowledge , and making it available through the internet .
no@@ wa@@ days , we can for the first time -- and the nasa admini@@ stration has shown this -- we can go from the digital world , of which the self-@@ organi@@ zing forces of networks to the physical world change .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that means something that is built in the city .
but tomorrow , to ask us the next challenges -- think about climate change or carbon emissions -- and how we can then change from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people in which they connect things together , colle@@ c@@ tively .
and the cloud is again a cloud of ima@@ gery , in the same way that a cloud of particles is made of particles of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of ima@@ gery .
it &apos;s a physical exhi@@ bi@@ tion in london , but it &apos;s covered with ima@@ gery .
and they can move inside and do different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments in the olymp@@ ia of 20@@ 12 and otherwise , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both of them , the physical cloud in the sky , and something on the top of it can go into , like the london of new mountain per mountain .
they can go into it .
and a kind of a deep@@ -@@ sha@@ ped po@@ cket in the night -- but as the most important , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
so thank you .
so as an artist , i &apos;m really important to the context .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to argue that people aren &apos;t separ@@ ated by nature , and that everything is related to each other .
the first time i was in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , i was in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ b@@ elt .
i &apos;m going to get hurt .
my heart ra@@ ste , i was embar@@ ras@@ sed , as i was trying to decide what was going on front of me .
the ice bul@@ ning around me , almost 60 feet away from the water , and i could only m@@ ess that this was a s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ per on another s@@ ne@@ ther lo@@ ck , 19 months ago .
ice mountains are born as a cal@@ ket of a gl@@ aci@@ er , or by blo@@ wn out of the ice .
each ic@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
they &apos;re clearly inter@@ acting with their surro@@ und@@ ings and their experiences .
some stro@@ kes up to give up and c@@ amp up to the bit@@ ter end , while others don &apos;t stop it anymore , and they &apos;re stac@@ ked together in an in@@ volu@@ it@@ matic passion .
when you look at a dinosau@@ r of ic@@ e@@ berg , it &apos;s easy that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , separ@@ ated and alone , just like we humans see us .
but the truth is far away from it .
while a ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i stor@@ ed its pro@@ gr@@ essi@@ onal atmosphere .
during the ic@@ e@@ berg , it dri@@ ves miner@@ al rich drin@@ king water , which f@@ ages a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go on my foot@@ age of this satelli@@ te , such as i do portra@@ its of my ancestors , in consciousness , that i &apos;m going to do portra@@ its of my ancestors in that way , and it never exists like that again .
it &apos;s not a death when you melt ; it &apos;s not a tail , but a continu@@ ation of your mind is on the way of life cycle .
some part of the ice in the ice that i &apos;m photograph@@ ed is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and a part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is show a ic@@ on that i &apos;ve been showing in ke@@ ker@@ t@@ su@@ at@@ c@@ clear in green@@ land .
very r@@ ar@@ ely , you &apos;re actually going to paint color onto a roll@@ ing ic@@ e@@ berg .
and this is what it is .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you can see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
so , hopefully you look at the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg , and where it &apos;s going to be on the water line .
you can see here , he begins to roll , and the boat is moving to the other side , the guy is there .
this is the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg .
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or about 40 meters .
and this is a video that is real time .
and just like this , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different page of your person@@ ality .
thank you very much .
my life is really extra@@ ordin@@ arily bl@@ essed by work to do some amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is temp@@ t@@ led .
it was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artist in the 198@@ 0s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and she said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs cr@@ ush . &quot;
and that was the out@@ break of that as .
so far forward today is completely paraly@@ zed .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing on him .
i have a company called design and anima@@ tions , gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably a complex part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and look at in the real@@ m world .
so we decided to have tony -- ste@@ am -- and suppor@@ ting his thing .
i met with his father and his brother , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i &apos;m only going to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back to him , and i said , &quot; wait , wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen ste@@ phen haw@@ king -- can &apos;t not talk all paraly@@ zed people through these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard the higher village layer and you have a remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , you can really do it .
normal people aren &apos;t available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how are you communic@@ ating ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &quot; bu@@ tter@@ ling &quot; and &quot; d@@ ess bal@@ let . &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how your fing@@ ers run along .
i was like , &quot; extremely arch@@ a@@ ic , how could that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just put a check out of a check , and instead i put out a check , which i didn &apos;t know the tin@@ i@@ est idea of how i was going to resol@@ ve it .
i direc@@ ted myself in place , and i direc@@ tioned his brother and his father -- saying , &quot; well , my pro@@ pos@@ al is like , &quot; tony is going to speak , we &apos;re going to have a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to make it again . &quot;
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that someone who doesn &apos;t deser@@ ve that yet , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i spoke at a conference a few months later .
i met these folks from gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allowed them to project a light on every single surface , and then draw with a las@@ er poin@@ ter , which is just regi@@ ster@@ ed the negative shape .
so they &apos;re moving around and doing art instal@@ lations like this .
they &apos;re saying that all of the things that are shown there are going to follow a living cycle .
it starts with the sex , then the nur@@ ses are coming , so the girls are re@@ je@@ cted , and at least , people are doing art .
but there used to be a life cycle in their pres@@ entation .
so i went home and ate with my wife at night , and i told her about all of it , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if we have this technology that you can use to control your eyes , to control things , then we should find a way that nar@@ row a las@@ er can control a las@@ er , so it can be a great way to fly back into gra@@ ff@@
and that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of other things , we &apos;ve achie@@ ved a few things .
one is , we &apos;ve put the in@@ sur@@ ance to the do@@ ors , and actually have gotten a device for a device that he can communicate with -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine .
that was an incredible thing .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i &apos;m calling him yo@@ da , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so weird , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we &apos;ve flo@@ wn seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally from all the hall@@ s of the world -- all of us to go home .
my wife , my kids , and i moved into the garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ sions and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy , and an@@ ni@@ sts , have taken our house through .
a lot of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and we sat back , and we got all the images on the walls that were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the she@@ pher@@ d of ven@@ ice in ven@@ ice , and my kids were comm@@ and@@ ed , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ win , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought on the be@@ ach@@ ing of ven@@ ice , a little bit of cop@@ per wir@@ es , and a couple of things out of building market and electr@@ onic commer@@ c@@ tors .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , put it out , put it on a le@@ t light , and now we &apos;ve got a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code free , the software you can down@@ load free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free of con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can be r@@ att@@ able .
no hospital , no hospital .
now , every paraly@@ zed can actually communicate or draw with its eyes or draw .
so thank you .
thank you very much indeed . that was incredible .
so at the end of the two-@@ week , we went back to speed room .
and i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and this is his bedro@@ om .
there &apos;s now all the big re@@ vel@@ ation of the great re@@ vel@@ ation of discovery .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , nu@@ del@@ y-@@ par@@ king and ab@@ und@@ ant , dre@@ w tony for the first time back to seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks out about his life support system .
we &apos;ve ra@@ cked his bed so it can see out .
we &apos;ve taken a proje@@ ctor to a hospital of the par@@ king field before the hospital .
and he dre@@ w again , for the first time , in his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the par@@ king lot .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , we still had to break into the par@@ king lot , so we felt pre@@ cis@@ ely as a part of the thou@@ ght-@@ type scene .
at the end of it , he sent us an email with the following content : &quot; for the first time for seven years , i was drawing something .
i feel that i was put under@@ water , and finally someone would pick up my head and put my head up so i could brea@@ the . &quot;
and isn &apos;t that over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
it &apos;s kind of like our laun@@ ch@@ y .
that kee@@ ps us up , and it kee@@ ps us to continue to develop .
and we &apos;ve got to improve a lot more about this .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes out of a magic board as well .
and somebody who has one such arti@@ cal potential , it deser@@ ves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
since that time , we &apos;ve gotten all kinds of recogni@@ tion .
we &apos;ve won a couple of pri@@ ces .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve to do it .
it all comes out of our own bag@@ s .
so the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
arm@@ strong twitter star@@ ed over us and then , in dec@@ ember , the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine announ@@ ced us as one of the 50 best inven@@ tions in 2010 , which was really great .
the cool@@ est part of this is -- and this inclu@@ des the whole circle -- this apri@@ l , this apri@@ l , in down@@ town of los angeles by los angeles , is going to be a exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the streets .
and it may be pretty much the tou@@ gh@@ est repres@@ ent@@ ors of the street art project -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ ws -- all these guys are going to be there .
nar@@ row is going to be part of the show , which is pretty sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
so basically , i &apos;m going to talk about this : if you can see something that &apos;s impossible , then it can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ ager -- everything was impossible at the time .
make it possible -- you &apos;ll all be here .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i had never had anything to do with ex@@ cess technology , but i just sort of figured out something , and surro@@ unded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs in the back .
and that question should be asked by all of you and every single day where you get something that needs to be done , if not now , when not i ? and if not me , who ?
thank you very much .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m likely to write america &apos;s most li@@ fel@@ ong child@@ book auth@@ or .
and i &apos;m always telling people that i don &apos;t want to come up with a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ ther , but no one has ever ele@@ cted farmers .
i &apos;d like to tell you today about cir@@ cles and epi@@ pli@@ tions .
well , an en@@ vel@@ op@@ ation is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve left it anywhere .
you go around the block , and you take it as a re@@ vel@@ ation .
this is a painting of a cir@@ cular .
one of my friends has done it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ tes .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 6@@ 0s at high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the class@@ 0s .
i was the one who was sle@@ pt every week in the morning of texas every week , until a teacher saved my life , and saved my life .
she saved my life by being able to use me in the teacher room .
this is what she was doing .
and she did it for three years .
and i had to go out from the city .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and then in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i found it very important to take aids organizations to work on .
about three or four years ago , i received a phone call from this teacher , woman party , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see you .
i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
can you come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please come together with the man that i know you &apos;ve found it .
and i should mention that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and that i want you to be p@@ is@@ sing . &quot;
so , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we cr@@ our@@ ned , and we knew that she had to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
we found one for them , we brought them in , and we got care of them , and we gave birth to her family , because it had to be .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , she was going to know , she turned into a box full of mine , and she was put in my hands .
and what happened was that the circle was closed , it became a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation that i talked about .
the re@@ vel@@ ation is that death is a part of the life .
she saved my life , and my partner , and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs to do .
he needs truth , and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that this is a lot of times today .
it needs the same -- it needs to have love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving these things .
thanks very much .
so , imagine a large explosion , as you get up to 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane for smo@@ ke smo@@ ke .
so , imagine a motor cre@@ ature , the c@@ oth , bla@@ g , bla@@ g , bla@@ g , bla@@ g , bla@@ mming , s@@ ack , s@@ ack .
this is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
well , i had a unique place on that day ; i was sitting on 1@@ 1@@ th .
i was the only one who could talk to you with the air@@ line .
so i looked at them at the same time , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already ai@@ red the machine , and we were not so far away .
you were able to see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot ended up fighting the machine after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
this is usually not the rou@@ te .
he squ@@ ee@@ zes the ta@@ il@@ -@@ hand@@ s .
so , imagine what a nice plane would be .
and then he said three words -- the most dangerous words that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; make a sha@@ p for the paper . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the cour@@ thou@@ ge .
i could see it in their eyes , there was g@@ rief , life was going to finish .
so i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that there is anything different in a moment .
we have this live plan , we have these things that we wanted to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to make a hand , and it didn &apos;t work , all the f@@ ences i wanted to fli@@ p , all the experiences that i wanted to do and never made .
and while i was thinking about it later , i noticed a phr@@ ase , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because when the wine is up there , the person is there , then i open it up .
i never want to shift something else in life .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that goal , changed my life really changed .
the second thing that i learned at that day -- and that was , when we mix@@ ed the george washington bridge , pretty much about hair sc@@ ales -- and i thought , &quot; man , there &apos;s one thing i really ad@@ ore . &quot;
i &apos;d had a good life .
in my own human@@ ability and with my fail@@ ures , i conclu@@ de to become more good in everything that i choose to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my e@@ go room .
and i for@@ got the time i was wa@@ sted for meaning@@ ful things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after all , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i have no longer argu@@ ed with my wife for two years .
it feels great to feel great .
i &apos;m not trying to have a right to have right ; i decide to be happy
the third thing i learned -- and this is when the inner clock started , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , &quot; ... &quot;
you can see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to break this thing up in 20 parts , as you know it from docum@@ ent@@ ations .
while we dro@@ pped , i had this feeling , human , to die , is not terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s almost as though we &apos;re prepar@@ ing our lives for the rest of our lives .
but it was very , very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sa@@ dness was really introduced in a thought , which is that i &apos;m just one thing wi@@ sh@@ ed .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
about a month later , i went to my daughter &apos;s first -- first gra@@ ders , not a lot of arti@@ cal talent ...
... yet not .
and i celebra@@ te me , i &apos;ll c@@ ry like a baby child .
and in the world , everything had a sense to me .
i became aware then by conne@@ cting the dots with each other , that in life , it &apos;s about being a great par@@ ent .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in my life to be a good father .
i became a mira@@ cle that was not going to die that day .
i had another gift , which is to look back into the future and come back and live differently .
my call to all of you who fly today is : can you tell the same thing on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but think about it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that you would dis@@ miss , because you think you &apos;d always be there ?
how would they change their relationships , and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can possibly be ?
so thank you .
the idea behind the sta@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is pretty stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward .
we don &apos;t want the iran to build the bom@@ b .
the most important one there is to develop nuclear weapons is the ur@@ ani@@ an in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ation in theater .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes that you see here , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
now , if we &apos;ve been able to comp@@ com@@ ment the systems that control distribu@@ tes and val@@ ves , then we can actually preser@@ ve a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
these gra@@ x@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run with windows patterns ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can make it a more effective window virus on a laptop that is used by a fighting engineer to con@@ fabri@@ cate this gra@@ y box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and this is the planning behind cur@@ x@@ net .
so we &apos;re starting with a window of win@@ d-@@ like .
the user data is trans@@ fer@@ red into the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ging the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the ir@@ ani@@ an force program -- ac@@ cur@@ ately ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ment .
that &apos;s a child game , isn &apos;t it ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
when we started to stage our research six months ago , six months ago was completely un@@ known what was the point and purpose of this con@@ struc@@ tion .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated what we knew about the windows part , the dru@@ p@@ per@@ y part , made it by r@@ ung@@ ine pe@@ a@@ ks of pe@@ a@@ - .
and it seemed to be something , with these gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ ings , this real life , controll@@ ing system .
and we started our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our neighborhood with st@@ x@@ net , and we studied this constru@@ ct .
and then something bizar@@ re happened .
sta@@ x@@ net was like a lab that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- sho@@ ot@@ ing it , but he didn &apos;t want to eat him .
and that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after i experim@@ ented with various kinds of che@@ ese , i felt that this was a re@@ com@@ men@@ ded attack .
completely adap@@ ted on a certain goal .
the dry rou@@ te activ@@ ation on the gra@@ y box , when a special con@@ figu@@ ration has been discovered , even when the special program , which is trying to infe@@ ct it on this target .
and if it doesn &apos;t , th@@ x@@ net is doing nothing .
so , this really got my interest , and we started working with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it may , say , for example , a u.s. power plant , or chemical plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we have better to find out what the goal is .
so extra@@ cted and de@@ com@@ men@@ ded , we found the price code , and we found that it would be em@@ bed@@ ded in two digital war@@ heads -- one small and bigger .
and we also noticed that they were very ritu@@ ally constru@@ cted by people who obviously had all the opposite information available .
and they knew every single bits and by@@ tes that they had to attack .
they probably didn &apos;t know the ru@@ b@@ ble of the machine contain@@ ers .
so they were all familiar .
and if you &apos;ve come up with the fact that the collapse of steps is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisti@@ cated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
and this is a clip from this sort of attack code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 limit@@ s , right ?
it looks pretty much like the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned language language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to become smart out of this code .
so , what we &apos;re looking for as the first se@@ ats , syste@@ m-@@ func@@ tion@@ ing is , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
and then we se@@ arch@@ ed for ti@@ ckets and data structures , and tried to connect it with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that we could con@@ ci@@ pa@@ te , or we could dis@@ prove .
in order to make these theor@@ ies , we call ourselves remem@@ ber@@ ing that it &apos;s definitely about high s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it has to be a good goal , and it &apos;s probably in iran , because most infe@@ ctions have been repor@@ ted in most infe@@ ctions .
well , in this area , there are not several thousand tar@@ gets .
in fact , it goes out on the bu@@ pes of nuclear power plants , and it &apos;s on the for@@ -@@ cen@@ ter@@ ing movement in tanz@@ ance .
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; leave me a list of all of the experts for cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ cks and power programs from our cli@@ p@@ al tri@@ be . &quot;
and i called them up , and i wo@@ ke her knowledge to compare their exper@@ ti@@ se to what we had found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , we were able to connect the little digital out@@ head with the whe@@ el controll@@ ers .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tat@@ ing , you really are able to sha@@ p the ro@@ tor , and eventually you can explo@@ de the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
and what we &apos;ve also found out is that the goal of the attack is actually getting it slowly and getting it incredibly difficult -- obviously in trying to get legal engineers to get out so they won &apos;t be able to get out of it .
the great digital head -- we got a look at it by looking at very pre@@ cis@@ ely data and data structures .
so , for example , the number 16@@ 4 st@@ ops out of this code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
i started working on scientific liter@@ ature , about how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ts are built in nat@@ ance , and found that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in what &apos;s called k@@ ard , and there are all sorts of tin cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ads in 16@@ 4 cent@@
so , that made sense , it adap@@ ted together .
and it became even better .
these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gen in iran are divi@@ ded in the 15@@ th of what &apos;s called
and guess what we found in the code of attac@@ king code ?
it &apos;s a pretty , very iden@@ tical structure .
so again , the clo@@ s@@ est really well together .
and this gave us great confidence for what we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go like that .
and these results were achie@@ ved by a couple of weeks of working work .
and a lot of times , we just ran down into a stop@@ shop , and we had to collect ourselves .
anyway , what we found was both digital war@@ heads in reality in reality and also the same goal , but from different direc@@ tions .
the little war@@ head is going on a be@@ at , and kno@@ cks up the ro@@ tors and slo@@ ws it down and slo@@ ws it and the great war@@ head is lin@@ ked with six cu@@ es in inter@@ acting and manipu@@ lation .
so , in a lot of times , we are very confi@@ dent that we &apos;ve actually known what the goal is .
it &apos;s nat@@ ance , and it &apos;s just about nat@@ ance .
so we don &apos;t have to worry about that other goals could be hit by st@@ x@@ net .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- made a reality to my so@@ cks .
down there is the gra@@ y box , and you can see on the top of cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gen .
well , what this really does is that it exp@@ ands the value values of sensor@@ s -- so for example , of pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s -- and it provi@@ des legi@@ ti@@ mate code , which still happens during the attack , with a hand@@ -@@ based data .
and in fact , this fal@@ se data of st@@ x@@ net has been recor@@ ded before .
so it &apos;s kind of the same way as in hollywood fil@@ ming , where the val@@ u@@ ries@@ -@@ lap@@ se video is being f@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of the game .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea here is obviously not only to cop@@ e the machine contain@@ ers in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous , and more ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
and the idea is to over@@ line a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where we can &apos;t respond to a human machine provi@@ ding human service .
so , in a power station , for example , if the great ste@@ am tur@@ bine gets too fast , you have to open up dis@@ rup@@ tive lines within milli@@ seconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
so , at this point , we need digital security systems .
and when the treat@@ ments are , then really bad things can happen .
and the power plant can explo@@ de .
and nei@@ ther leaders , even the security system , are going to notice it .
this is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and this is what i &apos;m saying now , is very important .
think about it . that attack is gener@@ ic .
he doesn &apos;t have any special to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gen , ur@@ ani@@ -@@ en@@ han@@ cing .
so it would work as well as it is in a power plant or in a car factory .
it &apos;s conven@@ i@@ ent .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attac@@ ks -- you don &apos;t have to put the development data on a us@@ b@@ art key , as we &apos;ve seen at sta@@ x@@ net .
you could also use ordinary ta@@ x technology to distribu@@ te .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and if you do that , you end up going to become a cy@@ ber mass wea@@ pon .
so this is the con@@ sequence we have to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for these attac@@ ks don &apos;t exist in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green regi@@ ons , these are the world &apos;s most rich@@ ur@@ able environments .
we have to make the consequences , and we have to pre@@ p@@ are ourselves better .
so thank you .
i &apos;ve got a question .
r@@ al@@ ph , it became a lot of it repor@@ ted that people sus@@ pe@@ ct the master organization is behind .
is it also your appe@@ ar@@ ance ?
all right , you really want to know this ?
yeah . all right .
in my opini@@ on , mo@@ s@@ ma is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the dom@@ esti@@ c super@@ power .
there is only one , and this is the united states -- fortunately , lu@@ ck .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thank you so much that you &apos;ve ch@@ ased a cure . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
i spent the last few years trying to place me in situations that are usually very difficult , and at the same time , dangerous .
i went to ja@@ il -- it &apos;s hard .
i &apos;ve been working on a co@@ al@@ min@@ y work -- dangerous .
i was photograph@@ ed in war regi@@ ons -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- very much at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end of it .
in fact , i &apos;ve come up with most of my career that i &apos;ve been thinking about , and it &apos;s all just for trying to study social success so that it &apos;s comp@@ elling and interesting , and hopefully in a way that &apos;s reas@@ on@@ able , and hopefully reas@@ on@@ able in a way that makes them happy for the audience .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to look at a ted@@ talk in a ted@@ talk and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i would do something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard about it that i &apos;ve ste@@ pped an ad on e@@ bay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent a bunch of facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to get the name rights to my ted@@ talk 2011 .
really , some happy individuals and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never leave it back -- the fashion rights of the talk , which you just see , which at that moment had no degree , and not a lot of evidence on what this top@@ ic would possibly be .
so , what you get is this : your name is this : my ted@@ talk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and which at the end of the end , you could fly around the e@@ ars , especially if i &apos;m your company for your invol@@ vement .
but again , a very good media opportunity is a very good media opportunity .
you know , how many people see these ted@@ talks ?
a whole bunch of things .
and by the way , this is just the job ring .
so , despite that war@@ sion , i knew that anybody would buy the rights rights .
now , if she asked me this a year ago , i would not have been able to tell you this with the certain@@ ty .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the adverti@@ sing .
as i said , i &apos;d been in some pretty awful situations in some pretty awful situations , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could be able to go on something as difficult as dangerous and as dangerous as with these guys to go into a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i &apos;d like to do is a film about patterns , marketing and adverti@@ sing , which is fund@@ ed with the entire film , is fund@@ ed by patterns , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
and the movie is going to call &quot; the web ever wars . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the bottom world &quot; is that everything , from above to bottom , is that everything , from the beginning to the end , are completely contain@@ ed with br@@ ands -- from the ti@@ tle spon@@ sor that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the mar@@ k x .
now this is the tag , the pit@@ al@@ al@@ art sta@@ dium , which is the sta@@ ir@@ case center .
these people are going to be lin@@ ked with the movie in forever -- forever .
and so the movie is going to study this whole idea -- this is what ? in ever@@ ness , for forever ?
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
this was more to con@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze .
it was &quot; in the ever@@ ness , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a scan@@ ent spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re certainly going to make sure we &apos;re going to sell every possible categ@@ ory in the movie .
that &apos;s how we &apos;re going to sell a sho@@ e , and it will be the greatest sho@@ e that you &apos;ve ever had .
the great car you &apos;ve ever had , from &quot; the bottom beginn@@ s , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had .
so the idea is , asi@@ de , asi@@ des that br@@ ands are a part of life , in fact , to get them fund@@ ing to fin@@ ance the movie ?
and we really show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all of this film is transpar@@ ency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of the stat@@ s .
so this is the whole concept , the entire movie , from the beginning to the end .
and i &apos;d love to be happy if ce@@ g was going to help me .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how com@@ pi@@ cious people are going to be people .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective &quot; because that has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but do you know how it &apos;s going to work ?
how much money is going to require to re@@ constru@@ ct this ?
1.@@ 5 million people .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth a matter of trying to address some really familiar mar@@ ks .
who knows when the movie comes out , maybe we &apos;ll see a hor@@ n of spi@@ d@@ sight .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is going to be extremely likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the movie , or a difficult thing about me ?
j@@ k : both of them .
so , it doesn &apos;t mean that optimi@@ stic .
so , my l@@ ord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help it .
all right .
fantastic .
we need to think about what &apos;s going on .
yeah .
when you look at the people who you have to do it with ...
there are a couple of places we can turn to .
take the camera out .
i thought , &quot; you know , take the camera out , &quot; would mean that we wanted to take a feedback interview .
and it turns out , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and it just disappe@@ ared all of these companies , one by the other .
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
i was ast@@ on@@ ished .
they didn &apos;t want to do absolutely nothing with the project .
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of adverti@@ sing is to present as many people as possible as possible , to see it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , in this inter@@ section of new and old media and the frag@@ mented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting tra@@ c@@ ature of con@@ mission , that the mas@@ ses will bring this message .
no , that &apos;s what i thought i was thinking .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a f@@ at@@ al er@@ ror , and that was how it was .
actually , no , that &apos;s not the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
that would have been fine .
but this is what this image is about , it &apos;s a problem .
you see , when you inclu@@ de transpar@@ ency at the google search , that &apos;s one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your art , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now .
that was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free of de@@ ception and po@@ cks , just to explore and back@@ late ; person@@ ali@@ zing by visual skills and access to information , especially what businesses are about -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transpar@@ ency .
our politicians tell us , even our president says , even our ce@@ os say it .
but when it comes to that far , it &apos;s going to change something .
but why ? well transpar@@ ency is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing -- like this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ous bear , which is still pain@@ t@@ ling .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- it &apos;s like this weird land road .
and she &apos;s very ris@@ ky as well .
what else is rich ?
a whole cool whi@@ p eating .
this is very ris@@ ky .
so when i started talking to the companies , and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father got me in the lie -- and he &apos;s sitting there watching me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three ver@@ sions . &quot;
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there is the real version . &quot;
so , you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there is only one company , an agen@@ cy prepared to help us -- and this is also because i knew john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ tree had known for years -- i realized i had to do it alone , i had to go out to the midd@@ le-@@ man , and i had to go right with my team to go
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand was -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how you &apos;re going to be understood with these companies , it &apos;s a bro@@ ad problem .
i have friends , the great , gigan@@ tic hollywood films , and i have friends , the little areas of the web movies like me .
and my friends , the great , gigan@@ tic hollywood films , say that the reason their films are so successful is on the mar@@ ks that they have .
and then my friends , the small web@@ -@@ making films , are going to say , &quot; well , how are we going to compe@@ te with these big , gigan@@ tic hollywood films ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the web ever beginn@@ s . &quot;
so , how exactly are we going to see las@@ ons in the movie ?
every time i go on the way , and whenever i open up the medical line , you &apos;ll see a bot@@ de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
and every time i interview someone else , i can say , &quot; are you gay enough to interview this interview ?
are you so far ? you &apos;ll see a little nervous .
i want to help you to cal@@ m yourself up .
so maybe you &apos;re supposed to put a little bit of this out of the interview . &quot;
and then we give up one of these great dun@@ es .
either &quot; su@@ g@@ ise , &quot; or &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise wind , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated both for men and for women , or a stick , whatever .
this is the short fra@@ ction .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a ful@@ l-@@ fil@@ lo@@ wed point .
we &apos;re a smaller br@@ ush .
as you speak about the smaller films , we are a challen@@ ging of challen@@ ging .
so we don &apos;t have one such a budget as other br@@ ands .
so to do things like this -- you know , remember people in ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what are the words you would describe about ?
ban is a bit of bl@@ k .
this is a great question .
pro@@ li@@ stat@@ ant technology .
technology is not the way you need to describe something that someone under the ei@@ gh@@ ths does .
we talk about kitchen , fresh , fresh .
i think &quot; fr@@ ish &quot; is a great word that these categ@@ ory really does something positive to something positive , as op@@ posed to &quot; wel@@ f@@ end smell and hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty . &quot;
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh .
these things have a much more positive effect .
and this is a milli@@ on-@@ dollar cre@@ ature .
what about to me ? what about the prin@@ ting pole ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , who are like me , ot@@ eless consu@@ mer@@ ors .
you &apos;ve got to tell me something about my brand .
how are you going to describe your brand ?
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
and i don &apos;t know .
i really love beautiful clo@@ th@@ es .
ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ eight re@@ vi@@ val hits sk@@ at@@ er@@ er@@ ri@@ cs , except on the was@@ h .
all right , so what &apos;s the rou@@ te of fat ?
un@@ belie@@ vable .
i think the gen@@ re , the style that i have is probably &quot; real glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ m@@ ples and stuff like that .
but i usually have an ac@@ cess@@ es@@ bird , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and such a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ an rate rio .
man 2 : the tag i am is , i would say , free fly .
woman # 2 : participa@@ te to hi@@ pp@@ i , part of jo@@ g@@ i , part broo@@ kl@@ y@@ al girls -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the ch@@ ot@@ ton guy .
i sell ty@@ es all over the country , and i sell the world .
so i think that this is my brand .
this is my brand in my little , cle@@ an@@ -@@ fire industry .
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x , because i was an a@@ er@@ ant .
man 5 : pun@@ k@@ ed al@@ co@@ hol squ@@ at@@ ches .
is it going ?
an@@ yer : i &apos;m a cham@@ pi@@ er mark .
i &apos;m a tom .
now , we can &apos;t all be the tom@@ b brand , but i &apos;m often seeing myself at the inter@@ section of the form of glamour and lung fly .
and what happened was , what noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could step up in my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call the &quot; string person@@ ality . &quot;
and so , i found a company named ol@@ son z@@ ol@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ cky , fe@@ at@@ ar , hall@@ mark , to discover these sig@@ ns person@@ ality .
if they were able to do it for those , they could also help me .
you brought your images with me , yeah ?
this is me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how it conne@@ cts with your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who are forming my world@@ view .
talk to me about this world .
m@@ d : this world ? i think the rest world is the world in which you live -- like people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live life , the work and so on .
all these things came from one place , and start from a place , and they begin to start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
so , what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about .
this is the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the context of thinking about yourself and feelings about yourself ?
it &apos;s as i &apos;d like to be .
i like some things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what is it going to bring you ?
what is the ma@@ che@@ te ? where is it that pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ce line is right now ?
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what is it about red ?
let me tell you a little bit about this part .
it &apos;s a little bit more about you that aren &apos;t you .
what other me@@ tam@@ or@@ ori@@ ics have you gone through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . what kind of steven is you ?
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your pati@@ ence .
yeah . all right . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to get out there .
there was a lot of crazy things going on there .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her bridge person@@ ality is two separate , but it has continu@@ ed pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lo@@ ck mar@@ mer is a nin@@ ite / band@@ -@@ hand@@ ed game .
it &apos;s very good news .
and i think there is almost a con@@ tradi@@ ction with that .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a fix@@ ing , rather than both of them .
a lot of companies tend to be -- and this is human nature -- avoid things where they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re sc@@ ared , these elements , and they &apos;re going to turn them out for themselves , they &apos;re sc@@ ared , and they &apos;re actually changing them for themselves in a positive , and that &apos;s a ni@@ p@@ ful ch@@ ange@@ ship .
what other br@@ ands are doing so ?
the first one is a classi@@ c , apple .
and you can see it here , refle@@ ctive , wi@@ i , min@@ i , of min@@ i co@@ op@@ er and je@@ t@@ po@@ es .
well , there are br@@ ands and ei@@ ght@@ ful ta@@ gs , those things that come and go , but a de@@ ck , ei@@ ght@@ ful mar@@ ks is a pretty strong thing .
a nin@@ ite , ready to get brand . what is your brand ?
if someone would ask you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would you be ?
you get it up up ? are you something that &apos;s going to get the blood in the sand ?
or are they more likely to get a clim@@ b ?
are they something that is a little bit more quie@@ t , adul@@ st-@@ efficient , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
lower at@@ tribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ful , fresh like the car prin@@ ce , gradu@@ ated , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , de@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , sing@@ ing and hand@@ le , ma@@ gi@@ cal , ma@@ gi@@ cal , ma@@ gi@@ cal , ma@@ gi@@ cal , ma@@ gi@@ cal and my@@ sti@@ cal as gand@@ al@@ f .
or are they more like a down@@ -@@ wea@@ ving ?
are they ancient and mon@@ mon@@ n like $ 00@@ 7 ?
are they trained , traditional , care@@ ful , deli@@ ght@@ ful , com@@ passionate , com@@ passionate like op@@ ra@@ h ?
are they reli@@ able , stable , family , sec@@ ure , sa@@ kes , sac@@ red , san@@ g , pre@@ ten@@ ded , like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
by the time of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were up and down and down companies , and the &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to be doing anything with this movie , because they had no control , no control over the product .
but it &apos;s found 17 mar@@ ks who were willing to avoid on this control that wanted to do with some business that wanted to make such se@@ ad@@ ful and coura@@ ge@@ ous like me , and who finally em@@ powered us to tell stories that we normally didn &apos;t have to tell -- stories that would have never suppor@@ ted a commercial .
it em@@ power@@ red us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you now use mr@@ s. is mr@@ s. is to stop the pleasure centers of the brain , both to make adverti@@ sing and films .
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where foreign adverti@@ sing had been dis@@ pu@@ ted .
in the entire city , five years from now , there is no pres@@ entation of adverti@@ sing , no poster , no flo@@ yer , nothing .
and we went to school school , where companies are affec@@ ting their way into fr@@ inging schools across the united states all over america .
and the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most feedback or where i had the greatest success , those are where i inter@@ acting with things directly .
and this is what these ta@@ gs have done .
because they went to the middle man , they ran the agen@@ cies , and they said that the agen@@ cies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate the artist directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people are trying to think about , that our world@@ view is challen@@ ging .
and how was this for you ? what &apos;s successful ?
now , since the movie was at the s@@ und@@ ance film festi@@ val , we can look at this .
according to bur@@ r@@ ish was pre@@ mi@@ ere in janu@@ ary , and since all -- and this is not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls from this movie .
in fact , this is a two-@@ two-@@ two-@@ two-@@ two-@@ two-@@ two-@@ week weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been issu@@ ed yet yet .
it doesn &apos;t even have it online . it &apos;s not a foun@@ da@@ ti@@ le .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries yet .
now , after all , the film has got a very big time .
and this is not a project for a project , where almost every adverti@@ sing agen@@ cy that we talked to , to give up their custom@@ ers to leave the fing@@ ers of it .
something that i think that something that belie@@ ves is that , if you get a chance , risk is in these risks .
i think if you hold people out of it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risk , you &apos;re prepared all the company to be prepared to get a profit .
i feel that we &apos;ve got to encoura@@ ge people to take risks .
we need to encoura@@ ge people not to have fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of possibility that they may be avo@@ i@@ ded .
finally , at the end of the day , we should be wel@@ fortun@@ ate .
we should put the bak@@ s in the c@@ oth .
get your fear of fear . call the risk of saving .
there &apos;s a big spo@@ d@@ board that we &apos;re going to wel@@ come to save .
and finally , we ought to be wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
no@@ wa@@ days , more than ever before , a bit of honor brings us a little bit reas@@ on@@ ably .
and that said , with hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my entire talk , &quot; you call transpar@@ ency , &quot; she was pres@@ ented by my good friends of em@@ c , the $ 7@@ 100 for the name of &quot; e@@ bay , &quot; at e@@ bay .
big data is trans@@ formed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
em@@ c : &quot; you &apos;re going to wel@@ come transpar@@ ency . &quot;
thank you very much .
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency , this is what &apos;s going on right to the $ 7@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ,@@
this is a great question .
i have a check in my po@@ cket , repres@@ ented on the head organization of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a s@@ mile in the al@@ titude of $ 7@@ 100 to fund my ted reach@@ ing next year .
my name is am@@ it .
tw@@ ent@@ y months ago , i did something else at google , and i started making something with mu@@ ums and art , my che@@ ak@@ in , which is today , gave me a blu@@ er light .
and it took 18 months to do .
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , i can tell you , 17 very interesting muse@@ ums of nine countries from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the pres@@ cri@@ ption .
there &apos;s a whole bunch of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and its access .
i was growing up in india .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t inv@@ ent -- but i had too many mu@@ ums , and i didn &apos;t have to have access to many mu@@ ums , these works .
and as i travel@@ ed , and i went to see these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried to make this credit -- to make art acc@@ essi@@ ble -- to lead together with technology .
so we set up a team , a great man@@ ager , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demon@@ stration , and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the laun@@ ch .
so , you &apos;re just going to google photo@@ son@@ o@@ .com .
you can see in all these muse@@ ums here .
there &apos;s the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , which is mom@@ a , the her@@ m@@ ks , the van go@@ gh , van go@@ gh .
i actually start in one of my favorite , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
it comes out to two ways -- very simple .
google , and w@@ um@@ ber , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you po@@ ur around .
you want to ori@@ ent yourself in the museum ?
open the card , pull it with a click of cli@@ ck .
they &apos;re in there , they want to be until the end of the gan@@ gs .
just going . a lot of fun .
stick them up .
thank you , but the best one is still coming .
so i &apos;m here in front of one of my favorite images , grou@@ ers of pie@@ ter bag@@ s in the met .
i see this pla@@ te sig@@ ner .
if the museum has given us the picture , click it on it .
now , this is one of the images .
so , these are all meta@@ data .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click on this right now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been looking at with the so-@@ called gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
so this image , for example , has about 10 billion visual points , i think , is .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to do for 10 billion visual points ? &quot;
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can go very easily and zo@@ om out .
you &apos;re looking at something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
but then they really want to get in deep .
and so i started playing around , and i noticed that something was happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait , wait a minute . that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the end , and i noticed slowly that these kids were actually hit@@ ting .
i was a little bit , talking to some familiar when i met , and i actually found out that it was a game called squ@@ a@@ il , where a gang was be@@ aten with a stick at the end of the day .
appar@@ ently , it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they were doing it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close , you can go up to the cur@@ gs .
just to give you the over@@ look , i &apos;m going to zo@@ om out , so you can see what you get .
and here we have , and this is the painting .
the best one is still going on -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump quickly to mom@@ a , back in new york .
another favorite picture of me , saturn en@@ night .
in the previous example , it was about finding the details .
but what if you want to see the br@@ ush stri@@ c@@ tures ?
and what is it that , if you want to see , van go@@ gh created this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
you zo@@ om@@ ed in . you can actually go into it .
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om into one of my favorite cli@@ ps of this picture until i &apos;m really on the ris@@ es .
this is a star en@@ night , probably seen this .
now , i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s still a lot of other ones , but i don &apos;t know about time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ c@@ tors .
every one of you , everybody -- if rich or arm , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- out of all these pictures you can put on your own colle@@ ction .
just simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om around .
this is &quot; the lo@@ ach@@ ing , &quot; in the national psychiat@@ ry .
you can tell everything with dis@@ orders , send your friends , and a conversation of what they feel when they look at these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
i think , by the end of it , i think the main thing for me is that all of the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even get out of the muse@@ ums , i think .
maybe i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and it was an experience in hu@@ mili@@ ty for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be a great medium medium with art , and we &apos;re going to represent it all together .
and the biggest question that i &apos;ve asked is , &quot; did you do that to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum
and the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s going to be encoura@@ ging experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
so thank you .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . your brain can be divi@@ ded in two la@@ yers .
this is the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then the right half that is the intui@@ tive side .
if we had a scale to measure the apple every he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere every he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , we could paint your brain .
for example , this is somebody who is completely logi@@ cal .
this would be a person who is completely adap@@ tive .
now , where would you em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze your brain on that scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of those , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ te , which is at the same time in both he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere .
it &apos;s not as though they &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely or they &apos;re like that .
they can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tively intui@@ tive .
and so i &apos;m looking at one of the individuals , along with the most other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good variety of lo@@ gic to add together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good number of different things to actually address the experiments .
how do we develop these intui@@ tions ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it , and look at how it respon@@ ds , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intui@@ tions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can only be at the same time .
i mean , it may sound strange to think that one thing at the same time is two different places , but they &apos;ve not been born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember a child watching me playing on a floor hall .
he was still a pet kid , not very good at it , and he continu@@ ed to stay away .
but i bet that he taught him playing a very pre@@ cious lesson , which is a very pre@@ cious lesson , which is that big things don &apos;t just leave you up , and she sta@@ ys in one spot .
and this is a great concep@@ tual model of the world , as long as you &apos;re not a partici@@ p@@ ist physi@@ c@@ ist .
it would be a horri@@ ble model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist because it doesn &apos;t play with soil ner@@ ves , but with these little particles .
and when you play with your particles , you can see all kinds of weird things -- how they fly directly through walls , or that they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all of these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called them the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe the small , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t have to describe it around the great everyday objects around us .
that doesn &apos;t res@@ end my intuition , and it may only be because i &apos;m not so often playing with partic@@ le games .
you know , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , no one has ever seen a partic@@ le .
but my logi@@ cal side hasn &apos;t liked it either .
because if all of the stuff are made out of particles , and all those particles are following the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , shouldn &apos;t it just track the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
i don &apos;t see why this should not be that way .
so i would feel a little bit better with the whole thing , if we could sort of show the fact that daily objects are also following the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so a couple of years ago , i made myself to do exactly this .
so i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the quant@@ um micro@@ position .
so , what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green point there in the middle of the center .
this is the piece of metal about what i &apos;m going to talk about .
and this is a picture of the object .
i &apos;m going to tell you something . we &apos;re looking right here at the center .
and here &apos;s a really big clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , and it &apos;s sha@@ ped like a spr@@ h@@ board , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing in a kind of a way that you make a computer chip .
i went into a sau@@ ttle space with new si@@ li@@ um , and i ste@@ pped for 100 hours of all these big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swi@@ mming pool of mine , and get this thing up .
this thing has got the ability to be the ability in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ senses , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me just give you an analog@@ y .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a full al@@ ace ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the el@@ ev@@ ator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i get rid of other people , and i &apos;m going to stop doing all these things because i don &apos;t want to hurt them , or , frank@@ ly , they &apos;re going to lose it .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ conven@@ ate objects are the same thing .
the ta@@ il@@ -@@ related objects are not just humans , but also the lights that seem to appear to them and the wind that ow@@ ns on them and the heat of space .
and so we knew that , if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we had to cut all the players out there .
and then that &apos;s what we did .
we went out the lights , put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and throw it out , cool@@ ed all the air and cool@@ ed it up to just right now , reach@@ ed the piece of metal , the piece of metal , the piece of metal , the way it wanted to .
so we &apos;ve measu@@ red his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really weird to move .
instead of saying it &apos;s just sil@@ ent there , it vi@@ br@@ ated it . the way it was vi@@ br@@ ated was something like this -- like an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating and gather@@ ing bubble bal@@ an@@ ces .
in which we gave him a little s@@ mile , we could be able to vi@@ bra@@ te it at the same time , not vi@@ br@@ ating -- something which is allowed to be allowed in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so , what i &apos;m going to tell you is what really really fantastic .
what does it mean to vi@@ bra@@ te it for an object at the same time and not vi@@ br@@ ating ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the meta@@ ons of atoms that are the piece of metal is still sitting there , and at the same time the same atoms are moving up and down .
it &apos;s just too pre@@ cise at pre@@ cise time points .
the rest of the time , they are del@@ asi@@ alized .
that means that every at@@ om at the same time is two different places , which , at the same time , is the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
it really .
it was worth me for all this year in cle@@ aner space , because notice this , the difference difference between a single at@@ om , and this piece of metal is about just the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single at@@ om is at the same time in two different places , this piece can be a piece of metal in two different places , why not you ?
i mean , this is just what my logi@@ cal page says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in a number of places , how would that feel ?
how would your mind deal with it that your body is del@@ oc@@ alized in the room ?
there is another aspe@@ ct at the story .
and as we heat it up , we saw the lights , and we looked down the box , we saw the piece of metal always in one piece .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks as if all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are actually par@@ ked objects , which are put together in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says everything is associated with everything .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more beyond it , it goes even more .
it is that these connections , their connections with all the things around you , are literally defin@@ ing who they are , and that is the profound and weird of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
thanks very much .
in 2007 , i decided we should re@@ design concep@@ tu@@ ali@@ ties as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they &apos;re going to live and work , they &apos;re given the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition for new resi@@ dents .
at the moment , we &apos;re very far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who are not even a single city that they &apos;d come to be wel@@ come .
but the amazing thing about cities is they value so much more than it costs to build it .
so we could just easily with the world very easy with sil@@ ent , maybe hundreds of new to@@ w@@ ns .
now this may sound ab@@ sur@@ d for you , unless you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but they &apos;re just pas@@ sing the train of a@@ part@@ ments against the cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in a@@ part@@ ments , including this already , but the other half didn &apos;t even exist .
they may try to exp@@ and the capacity of exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
but , you know , they were going to be born in these a@@ part@@ ments and their surro@@ und@@ ings of the environment to be able to avoid and to dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to spot all of these exten@@ sions .
but you could go to a whole new place , a whole new high@@ port block , and the laws exi@@ pped there would support you , and not del@@ a@@ w it .
so i suggest@@ ed that governments made new faces , which provide enough space for a city , gave them a name : char@@ ter kill@@ s .
later , i &apos;ve found that , about the same time , ja@@ wel@@ - and oc@@ 4 and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o have thought about the challenge of a re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year of about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ es every year left their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do , to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in hon@@ dur@@ as .
and at this point , h@@ 4 to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; what happens when we measure an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented land of our country , what if we put it just a message of the american message , some of the can@@ adi@@ an bot@@ tors -- and if people want to work out of the can@@ adi@@ an rule , or the united states , can they work there , and can they do things on the area of these mes@@ sages , what would they typically go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as was under a dis@@ pu@@ te of con@@ mission .
in the next current elec@@ tions , pe@@ ran@@ thro@@ bo lo@@ bo won in a fashion whose program , including both new organization , and in@@ san@@ e .
he was asking oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his bro@@ ar@@ der .
and in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing for a talk at ted@@ global .
through impro@@ vement and trying to use , and through the investi@@ gation of consum@@ ing , i &apos;ve been trying to reduce this complicated idea of char@@ ter city to the key elements .
the first thing is , is the importance of laws , laws that deter@@ mine that you can &apos;t dis@@ miss exi@@ sting tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
we &apos;re giving new technologies great , but for the progress needs , it needs technology and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that are holding us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the ted@@ talk .
again , he showed him ja@@ wel@@ le .
they called me all the time .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s meet this by the front of our country ! &quot;
so we met in dec@@ ember in the cour@@ ch hall of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make sense of how valuable cities are , how much of them are more valuable than they cost .
and i &apos;ve been using this ch@@ art to show how much ro@@ oth and is in a place like new york , consider that a surface in some cases per square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstra@@ ct discussion , at a place when there was a sing@@ er , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at ted@@ talk . &quot;
so , the ted@@ talk wonder@@ ed in a very simple shape that a char@@ ter city is a place whose first un@@ inten@@ ded country , a fo@@ unding comm@@ ange@@ ment , which recogni@@ zed the laws that gover@@ ns there , and the people who offer the opportunity to decide either to live under those rules or not .
and that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , who meant we have to make this project happen , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is becoming ahead .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ son , and i was asked to give a talk to the fourth and fif@@ th of janu@@ ary .
so , i gave another talk with the facts that had a graph like this , which has a graph like this , which is trying to realize that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is an image of the city of den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch turns out to be the new port that was built in den@@ ver .
there &apos;s a 100 square kilometers on this air@@ port , and it &apos;s 100 square kilometers
so i &apos;ve been trying to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ist of this , if you want to build a new city , you have to start an area from at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand ac@@ r@@ es .
poli@@ dly all have to be appl@@ au@@ ded .
the vie@@ wers of the audience were very serious and attention .
the con@@ gress &apos;s director came up to the stage , and he said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the ted@@ talk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so , i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
and i came up with the stat@@ ement that a new city provi@@ des the people new possibilities .
it would have been the opportunity to live in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as instead of hundreds of kilometers away in the north .
and a new city also inclu@@ des new ways of leaders with leaders .
the leaders in hon@@ dur@@ as in hon@@ dur@@ as would be involved in the help of partner@@ ship , they could benefit from their partner countries that they could navi@@ gate at the law for this char@@ ter and at the imple@@ ment@@ ation , that everybody could trust that the char@@ ter is really dis@@ advan@@ ted .
and the notion of president lo@@ bo , of course , was that the spirit of the advantage that i thought i had thought was a way to get foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come and to build this city as well as a city for all par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as for many years , which for many years and sus@@ pi@@ des .
we &apos;ve gone into an area .
this is a picture of this place .
it em@@ cum@@ bs a thousand square kilometers .
and shor@@ tly after , in the 19@@ th of janu@@ ary , they &apos;ve mis@@ sed con@@ gress for a change of the const@@ it@@ ution to have a const@@ it@@ u@@ ency of exi@@ sting action that is necessary for exi@@ sting regi@@ ons .
in a country which has just happened to be a dist@@ ant crisis , in which con@@ gress had ele@@ cted for 1@@ 24 to a voice for this con@@ gress .
all the par@@ ties , all the shapes of society , suppor@@ ted this .
to be a part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it needs to be appro@@ ved twice by con@@ gress .
on febru@@ ary 17@@ th , it was appro@@ ved for the second time at 1@@ 14 to a voice .
in addition to this ele@@ ction , between the 21@@ st of febru@@ ary and the 20th of febru@@ ary , a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 hun@@ ces to the two places of the world , which were interested in the most interested to rise into the business of the city .
this is a place of south korea .
this is a picture of a big new urban urban hous@@ ing , which is constru@@ cted in south korea , big than the city of bo@@ oms .
everything that you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the per@@ mit@@ gen@@ cy .
the other place , which was interested in the city of city , is sing@@ apo@@ re .
it has already built two cities in china , and the third is prepar@@ ing .
so , if you think of prac@@ tically about this , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a blu@@ e@@ print , and they &apos;re already going to mention this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system already , that management care allows us to participa@@ te , and it will also work on an ex@@ ternal legal system .
a country has already provi@@ ded the top of its highest cour@@ der , as a court for the dama@@ ging of state of govern@@ ance for the community .
urban designers and corpo@@ ra@@ te companies are very interested .
they even bring fund@@ ing to fund@@ ing .
one thing you already know already has been there , there &apos;s a lot of second .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to reduce themselves in america , particularly in a place with free management zone , and there are a lot of people who like to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who ad@@ mit that they want to live in a different place .
there are a million people left in la@@ tin america and migr@@ ating into the united states .
a lot of them are fa@@ thers who are forced to leave their families back to taste work -- sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to ear@@ n enough money to ear@@ n food and clo@@ thing .
unfortunately , sometimes , sometimes kids who are trying to find their parents that they have no longer seen for a decade , in some cases , for a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about this in hon@@ dur@@ as , a whole new city ?
or , even stupid of these cities , or distribu@@ ted hundreds of countries around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between a variety of cities that are about competition for new resi@@ dents ?
this is an idea that is worth spre@@ ading .
so my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as have asked me , thank you ted .
you know , how many choices do you make on a typical day ?
you know , how many choices do you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve spent a survey with over 2,000 americans recently , and the average number of decisions , which inci@@ dent@@ ally makes a typical american american day , is 70 .
and recently , a study has been done with ce@@ os recently , where she was watching the ce@@ o for a week .
and these scientists just docum@@ ented the various the@@ mes that these ce@@ o are working on , and how much time they &apos;ve spent some of the time making decisions that go together with the the@@ mes .
and what they found was that an average ce@@ o is working on 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks in the week .
each one of those subje@@ cts , of course , was made out of lots and lots of little decisions .
fif@@ ty percent of their decisions have been met within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their choice , they needed an hour or more of their time .
so think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you &apos;re going to meet in the nine minutes of time versus the one hour of categ@@ ory ?
how good , do you think you &apos;ve got to deal with that choice ?
i &apos;d like to talk today about one of the biggest decisi@@ on-@@ making problems of our modern time , the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem .
i &apos;d like to talk about the problem , and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know how to know your answers .
so if i ask you one question , you &apos;ll drive because i &apos;m blind , just your hand , if you want to burn some cal@@ va@@ tus .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , you know , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem ?
thanks very much .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very ex@@ clu@@ sive hous@@ ing , and at least he was really ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely .
it was a store called the tre@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
this is a business , it was almost like a joy of pleasure .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d and aff@@ lu@@ g , and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ it and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of water -- and it was at a time when we had drin@@ ked water .
i loved to go to that business , but at a moment i wonder@@ ed , well , how &apos;s it going to buy something that you never buy ?
this is the o@@ live oil gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those ones that were in bo@@ xes that came from thousands of years of o@@ live o@@ live trees .
so i decided to go one day , and i asked the leader , and i asked the leader , &quot; does this model work that you really offer the people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he poin@@ ted on the bus@@ es of tou@@ ri@@ sts who came every day , and they typically had their c@@ ameras on it .
we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se ma@@ d@@ lock for our experiments .
here &apos;s your ma@@ ster@@ -@@ class gang .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of mar@@ ry sor@@ ses .
we &apos;ve put a small co@@ ordin@@ ation ti@@ cket right on the ent@@ r@@ ance of the shop .
we put up six different ta@@ stes of ta@@ x or 24 different ta@@ stes of ta@@ x , and we looked at two things : number one , i suppose , i suppose , would be more people standing , and they &apos;re trying to try to do mar@@ sages ?
it &apos;s more people fall@@ ing when it were 24 percent , about 60 percent when it was six percent , about 40 percent .
and after that , we saw ourselves in what case people bought a glass of mar@@ thou@@ d@@ ame .
now we have seen the rever@@ se effect .
and of the people who were dying when they were 24 , they were buying only three percent a glass of mar@@ ry .
and of the people who were dying than six were six , well , now we saw that 30 percent of them bought a glass of mar@@ thou@@ d@@ ass .
well , if you sele@@ ct it , people bought six times a glass of mar@@ ry , which you had six choices to choice when you had a choice .
now , don &apos;t decide to buy a glass tag is perhaps good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our ta@@ ist -- but it turns out that the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem also influ@@ enced us in a very con@@ sequence choice .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it comes to our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day is finan@@ cially saving .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to describe to you with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , au@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ ang j@@ ang , where we looked at the decisions for almost a million americans from about 6@@ 50 plans in the entire united states .
and what we saw ourselves was whether the number of ow@@ ners that were possible to make a reti@@ re@@ ment plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , impact the prob@@ ability of whether tomorrow is saved for tomorrow .
and what we found is that indeed there was a context .
for example , in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that would give people a difference between two to 5@@ 9 different fin@@ ches .
and what we found out was that the more fund were provi@@ ded that , indeed , the participa@@ tion rate was less than the participa@@ tion .
now , if you look at the extreme speci@@ or , the plans , which cele@@ br@@ ates two fin@@ ches , there have been a part@@ band in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans of almost 60 fin@@ ches , the participa@@ tion of participa@@ tion now fell on about the six@@ th-@@ highest percentage .
now it turns out that even if you have more choice to participa@@ te , if you &apos;ve got more op@@ tions to choose , even then it has negative consequences .
and so the people who decided to participa@@ te , more to say that the more possibilities they had is available to them , the more promis@@ ing they &apos;re going to pay it and pay it .
the more op@@ tions of them were available , the more they gave their entire money into p@@ ure market accoun@@ ts .
none of those extreme decisions will be heard to the choices that someone would re@@ com@@ men@@ d if our future financial well-@@ being is important to us .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three key negative con@@ sequence in humans that offer money from more and more choice .
they pre@@ fy the decision -- push them up , even if it &apos;s affec@@ ting their own best interest .
they make more dam@@ n decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
it &apos;s more likely to decide for things themselves to be less comfortable , even if you do it obje@@ ctive .
now , the main reason for this is that maybe we &apos;re enjo@@ ying these huge direc@@ tors full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mu@@ star@@ d , obs@@ ession and ma@@ d@@ lock , but we &apos;re actually not able to pull the compar@@ ations and the bottom lines , and then we actually can &apos;t choose something out of the most fantastic interven@@ tion .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve te@@ sted in various types of research and in different research places -- that you can just use in your business .
the first one is : limit@@ s .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never more true than now , that less is more .
the people are always fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed when i say , &quot; limited . &quot;
they &apos;re always wor@@ rying that they lose the earth &apos;s surface .
but in fact , we see it more and more that if you &apos;re willing to bor@@ row , and the un@@ important quanti@@ fi@@ can@@ ce is getting rid of it , then there &apos;s an increase increase of sal@@ es , it &apos;s going to cost the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s impro@@ vement of decisi@@ on-@@ making perception .
as pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble , the different head and the equivalent of 26 percent were re@@ duced to 15 , and they were able to get a redu@@ ction of the sal@@ es of sal@@ es by a 10 percent .
when the journalist c@@ at corpo@@ ration came out to be her 10 of the worst selling c@@ us fin@@ us , she felt that the dro@@ yers were about 8@@ 7 percent -- a result of extin@@ ction rates -- a result of extin@@ ction rates and
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ kr@@ t today , they give you 4@@ 5,000 products .
a typical wal@@ m@@ art today is going to give you 100,000 products .
but the ne@@ ar@@ est super@@ market , which is now nin@@ e-@@ largest super@@ market in the world , is al@@ di , and they &apos;re provi@@ ding you only 1,@@ 400 products -- some kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in a do@@ se .
now in the world of sav@@ ings , i think one of the best examples that came out of the market recently is something that david la@@ g@@ son has created very strong about how david la@@ g@@ son has created very strong , it &apos;s a program that is off@@ ered at harvard .
and every single harvard emplo@@ yer now does auto@@ matically in a lifetime of life .
the ones who really want to make a choice are 20 f@@ ans , not 300 or more f@@ ans .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m going to fail it . &quot;
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities diff@@ ers from each other . &quot;
and if they hadn &apos;t gotten them out , their custom@@ ers can &apos;t get away . &quot;
well before we started talking today , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience to offer a hand@@ ful of pay@@ mented vac@@ ation to the beautiful street of the world .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read that to you .
and i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read you , and i &apos;m going to ask you to cla@@ p , if you &apos;re willing to participa@@ te g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
all right . anybody who &apos;s willing to participa@@ te g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
is that all ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it .
you know , it was a trick , right ?
now , who is ready to do this journey .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that they looked very obje@@ ctive at the first time , and i had more information than the second time , but i &apos;d like to tell you a car that she felt like she was going to experience it for the second time .
because the images were going to re@@ mind it for you to re@@ build it .
what i get to do with the second technology that helps you want to deal with the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making , it &apos;s a con@@ cre@@ te .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between opportunities , to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that &apos;s where these consequences are vi@@ vid and con@@ cre@@ te to be felt .
why are people going to be at average 15 to 30 percent more when they &apos;re using an ec@@ -@@ map or a credit card than they &apos;re using g@@ inger ?
because it doesn &apos;t seem to be a money .
and it turns out that when you make it , it feels that something feels con@@ cre@@ te , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i &apos;ve done with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o fli@@ ther@@ o , and we &apos;ve done a study with the people who are all working on back@@ side -- and these people were all in a comm@@ and@@ ment where they &apos;ve sig@@ ned their participa@@ tion for their reti@@ re@@ ment services .
and in this gather@@ ing , we &apos;ve got this con@@ sequence in the same way as it always was , we just ad@@ ded a small ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy .
the small@@ ness that we &apos;ve put asi@@ de was that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in the participa@@ tion by 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save or grow by four percent by the time they were willing to pay care for sav@@ ings .
the third techni@@ que : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
we can make more choices than more choice than we have more choice .
so , for example , this is a study we &apos;ve done in a magazine course .
and it turns out that it &apos;s in the shoes of super@@ markets , and down in the nor@@ the@@ ast region , the number between 3@@ 3@@ 1 different types of maga@@ zin@@ es up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 new@@ spa@@ pers to 6@@ 6@@ 4 .
but , you know what ?
if i &apos;m going to talk to you about 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and spli@@ t them in 10 categ@@ ories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es , and i &apos;m going to tell you that i gave you more choice and a better choice experience , when i had to give you the 400 of them , if i &apos;d given you the 600 .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how i can hold them apart .
there are two different g@@ ap@@ s .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz , &quot; and the other is &quot; s@@ wing . &quot;
if you think the left record is s@@ wing , and the display on the right is ja@@ zz , then you cla@@ p in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think the fact is ja@@ zz is in the left , and the one on the right side is s@@ wing , you &apos;re cla@@ pping .
okay , a few more ones .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz , and it &apos;s s@@ wing on the right , but you know what ?
this is a highly un@@ useful categ@@ ori@@ zing equipment .
the categ@@ ories need to say something , not which choice provi@@ des the choice .
and this is a problem often , when you look at the long li@@ mit of all of these f@@ ans .
who do you really want to engage with it ?
my fourth technology : con@@ mission for complexity .
it turns out that , in fact , we can deal with more information than we think , we just need to simpli@@ fy it .
we &apos;ve got to exp@@ and the complexity again .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated choice : the k@@ ale of a car .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car company who provi@@ des you the opportunity to con@@ fabri@@ cate your car completely self-@@ repli@@ cate .
you &apos;ve got to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to design your car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that you offer per choice to every choice .
car colors , out@@ door color -- i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 possibilities .
mot@@ ors , ge@@ ars -- four op@@ tions .
now , what i &apos;m doing is , i &apos;m looking at the order in which the choices will appear .
half of the custom@@ ers are going to be about the many possibilities of 5@@ 6 car colors to the low possibilities , four ge@@ ar .
the other half of the custom@@ ers are coming from the low possibilities , four ge@@ ar , to the 5@@ 6 car colors , a lot of possibilities .
so what do i look at ?
how interested they are .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choice in the decision , it means that they &apos;re being over@@ la@@ id , the heal@@ ing , i &apos;m losing it .
what they find is that the people who go from the many to the very few choices of choice and keep the standard ele@@ ction and the standard choice .
we are losing them .
go from the lack of choices to the many , and then you stay on .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is changing the order in which this information is going to be present .
so when i look at the simple , i learn how i choose .
even though the ge@@ ars choose to choose me , none of my pre@@ val@@ ence is saying to me , i still don &apos;t always care about it .
it also makes me feel excited about the big product that i assem@@ ble , and so i &apos;m willing to motiv@@ ate myself to be interested in it .
so let me wra@@ p together .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques , which is the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making mil@@ ges -- limited -- get rid of over@@ all alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ ci@@ zing -- make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ zing -- we can make it real ; categ@@ ori@@ zing , we can make more speci@@ alists , fewer possibilities , in complexity .
now , every one of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people that you &apos;re going to offer service .
because i think that the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re sel@@ ele@@ c@@ table .
and the more we sele@@ ct choo@@ sing , the better we &apos;ll be able to do the art of choice .
thanks very much .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in the mer@@ c@@ ca , i &apos;m a member leader at youtube . i &apos;m going to watch youtube video .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos are vi@@ ral , and then , again , we want to talk about why this is important .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ty , sing@@ er , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed so infin@@ ite .
but web videos have allowed us that all of us , or all of our creative activi@@ ties , can be famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next satur@@ day .
but at youtube , more than 4@@ 8 hours video per minute , you &apos;ve got to get rid of
again , a tiny percentage of it is ever vi@@ ral , and it &apos;s seen thousands of times and so on the cultural moment .
so how is this going to work ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , partic@@ le communities , and the un@@ expected .
well , let &apos;s just want to do this .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god !
who@@ a !
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , w@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
last year , image vas@@ ber z sen@@ sor@@ ed this video he had fil@@ med in the yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this ch@@ art shows what it looked like , when the video was popular last summer .
in fact , the thing didn &apos;t want to do was make a vir@@ o-@@ dollar video .
he just wanted to spli@@ t a rain@@ bo@@ w .
because it &apos;s kind of like when you &apos;re called yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain galaxy .
he had brought up a lot of natural videos .
and this video was actually taken in janu@@ ary already in janu@@ ary .
what has happened here ?
there was j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel did the t@@ we@@ et , who was so popular at the end of the video .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ ys k@@ im@@ mel gives us new and interesting things , and show them a great audience .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . go@@ ta wal@@ ks down down@@ day . i mean , it &apos;s the web@@ front to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day . you didn &apos;t think we would join those conversation without talking about this video , hopefully i . &amp; lt ;
re@@ bec@@ ca mal@@ ac@@ k &apos;s &quot; fri@@ ght-@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
and this is what the graphi@@ cs looked like .
just like the &quot; hig@@ zen rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; seems to be out of no@@ where .
what &apos;s going on that day ?
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know it , these other p@@ ells are stac@@ ks too .
but what about this particular fri@@ day , this particular fri@@ day ?
well , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 poin@@ ted it , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son , von myster@@ y science theater was a first person who made a jo@@ ke on twitter about this .
and what &apos;s important is that a single person or a group of ta@@ ste@@ makers took a focus point , they divi@@ ded with a big audience , and so they acceler@@ ate the process .
and then this community of people who shared this big inter@@ jo@@ ther , and started talking about it and started to play around and to play around with it
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ ght-@@ day &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single day week .
unlike the lon@@ den entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , the participa@@ tion of the community is the participa@@ tion of the community -- either by spre@@ ading it or doing something new .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at , &quot; is anima@@ tion and music in the end@@ -@@ to-@@ loo@@ p .
that &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
this year , almost 50 million times , looked at it .
and if you hold that up for crazy , you &apos;d know that there is a three-@@ hour version that was turned in four million times .
and even cat@@ s look at this video .
cat@@ s are looking at cat@@ s who are watching this video .
what &apos;s important is , the creativity that is in the internet culture of technology and ge@@ e@@ ks .
there was re@@ mix@@ ing .
somebody made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of it .
and then it became internation@@ ally .
a whole re@@ mix@@ y community shot out of the ground that made it a sil@@ ent jo@@ ke to something that we all participa@@ te to participa@@ te .
today , we don &apos;t just find joy about something , we do with it .
who could have thought all of this ?
who would predict &quot; photo rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at ? &quot;
what were he going to write to write in which this was supposed to be ?
in a world where every minute of two days of video is u@@ plo@@ aded , only un@@ seen and un@@ expected phenomen@@ a can tell you that we have a video and un@@ expected phenomen@@
i ad@@ mit , i wasn &apos;t really interested in telling a friend , when a friend told me i &apos;d look at this great video , about a guy who was prote@@ cted in new york against the ti@@ me@@ on of bi@@ kes .
i got a ti@@ cket because i &apos;m not on the bi@@ ke path , but there are often dis@@ abilities that aren &apos;t going to take you all on the way down to the bi@@ ke .
because this was quite surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey k@@ ans@@ art was funny idea , and his reason was a five-@@ million million times .
this approach is true for anything new what we crea@@ tively do .
and all of this leads to a big question ...
and what does that mean ?
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
and what does that mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative partici@@ pants , completely un@@ expected , are the characteri@@ stics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to , and the audience in which the audience is present .
as i said , one of the greatest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- did its end at the end of youtube .
no one &apos;s got to give up green light .
and today we feel all of us feel as ow@@ ners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteri@@ stics of the old media , and they &apos;re har@@ dly making the media of today , but they &apos;re going to be expres@@ sing the conversation of the future .
thanks very much .
how can i talk about the inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness between women over three generations , and how the ast@@ on@@ ishing strength of this inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness was mani@@ pul@@ ated in the lives of a four@@ -year-old girl , when she was in her baby and her baby and her grandmother , five days and her grandmother &apos;s life in a small boat . a bin@@ osity that lived in the life of this little girl , and never disappe@@ ared more -- this little girl , which is now living in san francisco , and she &apos;s talking to you today ?
it &apos;s not a story yet .
it &apos;s a piece of puzz@@ le that &apos;s going to be put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzz@@ les .
so , imagine the first piece : a man who bur@@ ns his life work .
he &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a man whose entire life has been put together from the simple hop@@ es of surgery and freedom of his home .
if you think about it in sa@@ ig@@ on &apos;s pla@@ te in sa@@ ig@@ on , he has to be aware that his life was a single drop of dry .
the words , as long as his friends , the goo@@ d-@@ sha@@ ped .
and he went back into sil@@ ence .
he died , she was broken through history .
he &apos;s my grand@@ father .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
my grandmother never for@@ gotten me to forget his life .
i had to worry about that it wasn &apos;t too much , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to cr@@ ush us , but we over@@ come it .
so the next piece is how a boat is going out at the early mor@@ mic red bar on la@@ ke la@@ kes .
my mother ma@@ i was 18 , when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , had two little girls .
for her , she had a task , she had a task : the flight of her family and a new life in australia .
and it was completely appropriate that they could fail .
after a four@@ -year-old and film ho@@ fe poin@@ tly on the ocean , a boat ra@@ ped on the la@@ ke , as fishing sou@@ den .
all the adults were aware of risk .
they had the biggest fear of pir@@ ation , ra@@ pe and death .
like most adults on my boat , my mother dro@@ pped a little po@@ cket bottle .
when i was a pris@@ on@@ er , my sister and me would have was@@ hed her , and she was drin@@ king my grandmother .
my first memor@@ ies are from this boat -- the plu@@ ck@@ ers of the engine , the cla@@ p of every wave on the bu@@ g , the larger and empty hori@@ zon .
i &apos;m not going to remember the pir@@ ates that came out a lot of times , but from the death spirit of men on our boat , or at the level of the motor of the engine that six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform outside mal@@ ay@@ an coast , and i remember the young man who walked up and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the fla@@ vor of the first apple , which one of the men had on the platform .
no apple has ever mel@@ ted that out again .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next puzz@@ le is about four women in three generations that are together building a new life .
we sat down in foot@@ sc@@ ray , one from the work@@ school community , which is where popu@@ lations are made out of im@@ migr@@ ant neighbor@@ ings .
unlike the ol@@ d-@@ class classroom sub@@ ur@@ bs whose existence was completely un@@ known , in foot@@ sc@@ ra@@ ws , there was no thou@@ ght@@ ful thinking .
the sm@@ ells coming out of the la@@ ils of the world from the rest of the world .
and the l@@ ents of birds were separ@@ ated between people who had one thing in common : they were re-@@ re@@ co@@ very .
my mother was working on far@@ ms in a car factory , six days , six days , double la@@ yers of la@@ yers .
it felt you kind of felt the time to find english and gender quali@@ fi@@ cations .
we &apos;ve been poor .
each dollar was divi@@ ded , and it was em@@ bed@@ ded in more education for english and math , no matter what we had to do about it , and most of the time , the new stuff , which always came from the next hand .
there are two pil@@ es for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
a school uni@@ form to the c@@ and@@ y , because she had to do six years .
and there were the rare but pain@@ ful ch@@ au@@ re of &quot; bad eye , &quot; and here and here , &quot; asi@@ re@@ ils , goes home . &quot;
so back home ?
something ble@@ t@@ ched in me .
there was a meeting to re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ate , and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister , and i sleep in the same bed .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we said to each other from our day , and we listen@@ ed to the movement of our grandmother in the house .
my mother was suffering from the boat dreams from the boat .
and it was my job to stay up every night , until her nin@@ est dreams came out , so i couldn &apos;t wake them up .
she opened a computer business , then she made a co@@ s@@ me@@ tic education , and he still opened up a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t feed change , an@@ gry and un@@ flexi@@ ble children , and ex@@ posed children , grew up between two worl@@ ds .
the fun@@ ders and spon@@ sor@@ s have been se@@ arch@@ ed .
central centers have been built .
i was living in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , the un@@ questi@@ on@@ able dem@@ and@@ ments in itself .
in the other hand , i was involved in un@@ safe life , wearing the tra@@ gic sc@@ ars of violence , the drug ab@@ sen@@ ce and the insu@@ lation .
but that was how many years there had been assi@@ sted .
and because of those help , i was ele@@ cted as a young austr@@ alist in my last year of ju@@ ven@@ age , as a young austr@@ alist .
and i was sha@@ ped by a piece of puzz@@ le to the next , and i didn &apos;t connect the ed@@ ges of the clo@@ ch@@ est .
tan le , anony@@ mous edi@@ tion of foot@@ sc@@ ale , was now r@@ oth , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , who became invited to talk about places she never heard about , and in other ways , they could never imagine what they had never imag@@ ined .
i didn &apos;t get familiar with the lab@@ els .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bri@@ be .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back into the r@@ out@@ ine and the spirit of an un@@ known conference -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters , who gradu@@ ated so much every single week , as for 20 years , by telling each other &apos;s stories and invited them to sleep , and we still laugh@@ ed three in the same bed .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she remem@@ ber@@ ed me that now i was as old as she had clim@@ bed the boat .
no , no way was never a way .
&quot; do it just , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i spoke about ju@@ g@@ gl@@ y and education , and the gr@@ at@@ u@@ ation of mar@@ g@@ in@@ oni@@ zed and car@@ an@@ u@@ tic@@ ation .
and the more open i speak , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all wal@@ ks , so many of them did what they loved , living at the limit@@ ations of the possible possible .
and while i had graduate , i realized that i could not find myself with a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
there had to be another piece of puzz@@ ul@@ es .
and i realized in the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new grou@@ er , new in image -- not just fine , but not just fine , but something that you have to be gr@@ ate@@ ful , maybe a gift of the boat .
because in order to be clear so easy to collapse the hori@@ zon , it can mean so ligh@@ tly that you &apos;re accep@@ ted the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment .
i &apos;ve come to be enough from my conven@@ tional zone to know that , yes , the world is breaking apart , but not the way you fear it .
opportunities that would not have been allowed were ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly encoura@@ ged .
there was a energy , an in@@ san@@ ate optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and the wa@@ g@@ gery .
so i followed my gut sen@@ sation .
i gather@@ ed a small team of people around me for whom the bo@@ il@@ ing &quot; walking &quot; is not an inevi@@ table challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a co@@ operation .
and at the end of every day , i cooking a big car@@ d@@ board sou@@ p that we shared .
we went back until late to night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a couple of brilliant things , and we created the break@@ through .
i met the decision to pull out to the u.@@ s .
and after just a journey .
my gut sen@@ sation again .
three months later , i went back , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure continu@@ ed to go .
so , before i leave this talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ a was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in of the person &apos;s most important person .
life hadn &apos;t changed for cent@@ u@@ ries for cent@@ u@@ ries .
her father died shor@@ tly after her birth .
her mother was leaving her up alone .
she was the second woman of a las@@ ar@@ in whose mother poin@@ ted her up .
so , without support of her husband &apos;s support , she provi@@ ded it for a hand@@ ful , by having him in court , and a more larger job than she would win .
&quot; not &quot; is not &quot; is un@@ true . &quot;
i was sho@@ ot@@ ing in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and i looked through the sho@@ cks , and i looked at it on the other side .
i knew she &apos;d come to sleep to sleep .
my mother shou@@ ted me a few minutes after that .
a couple of days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ray , and we sat around her sar@@ bec@@ on .
we told her stories , and we as@@ sure her that we were more at all .
and at mid@@ night , the mon@@ k and he said he had to close the sar@@ let .
my mother asked us to play her hand .
and she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm , and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; because she &apos;s holding it on this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t let them get rid of it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women , and it &apos;s all about women .
see who we were , and how life formed us , we can now see that the men who might have come to our lives to get us to get us out .
it was too easy to be .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think i &apos;m going to go to the boat
who &apos;s ever going to want to do one ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privi@@ lege , suffering , an@@ x@@ iety of conflict .
can i give you a bu@@ g in your life , the coura@@ ge@@ ous of every wave stor@@ ed , the un@@ color@@ ed , ste@@ al tu@@ ck@@ ers of the engine , the wide hori@@ zon , who doesn &apos;t guar@@ an@@ tee anything ?
i don &apos;t know it .
but if i could give that , and sur@@ ely they could get through it , i would do it .
and also , t@@ ans &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fif@@ th row .
i &apos;m here to share with you my photograph@@ y with you .
is it a picture of photograph@@ y ?
because of course , that &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t absor@@ b with your camera with your camera .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , my interest in photograph@@ y , when i was given my first digital camera , at age 15 of 15 years .
i combin@@ ed it with my former interests for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because when the camera &apos;s using the camera , it was more in planning .
and if you take a picture of a camera with a camera , the process follo@@ ws when you &apos;re sending it on the dis@@ hes .
so to me , photograph@@ y was more likely to go to be at the right place at the right time .
i thought everyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process is going to begin when the fri@@ fi@@ der is pun@@ ched .
photos like this one : a building spot along a much more remote street .
but it has an un@@ expected pat@@ su@@ lation .
and still don &apos;t care about a reali@@ stic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and color@@ ful at the same time , but everybody with the common goal to keep a reali@@ stic level .
i mean , if i say reality , i mean a photo reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really catch in , but i just want to make it look like it &apos;s going to have you , it &apos;s on a
photographs where you have to think a quick moment to figure out how to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more likely to capture an idea , rather than really a moment .
now , what is the trick that makes it reali@@ stic look at ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what is the illusion of this ?
sometimes , the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpre@@ t the world , and how it can be done on a two-@@ dimensional space .
it &apos;s not what &apos;s reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic
so , i think the basic ones are very simple .
i see it as a puzz@@ le of reality , where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you just a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three ultra@@ -@@ form@@ able objects that we can identify by all of us in a three-@@ dimensional world .
but combin@@ ed in a particular way , you can create something that will still look at three-@@ dimensional as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is impossible .
so we over@@ lay our brains , because our brain really doesn &apos;t toler@@ ate that it doesn &apos;t really matter .
and i look at the same process in combin@@ ation of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different things .
so the things that really make a picture look at , i think , is the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday life .
but if we com@@ bine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you &apos;re just going to see it wrong .
so i &apos;d say that there are three simple rules to be achie@@ ved in order to achieve a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
and as you can see , these are not three special images .
now connect something special like this , but you can create something special like this .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ing photographs should have the same perspective .
second , adap@@ ted photos should have the same ligh@@ ting of light .
and these two pictures are played these two ideas -- out of the same al@@ titude and the same ligh@@ ting form .
and thir@@ dly , it &apos;s about making it impossible impossible , where the individual images begin and end by conne@@ cting se@@ am@@ less@@ ly .
does it impossible to tell how the photo was actually put together .
so by putting color , contr@@ ast and blin@@ dness on the ed@@ ges of individual images , photogra@@ ved photogra@@ gs , like field d@@ ones , dis@@ rup@@ ted colors and dis@@ orders , we &apos;re pus@@ hing the boundar@@ ies between the various images , and let &apos;s look at it like a single photo , even though a picture can basically em@@ body hundreds of levels of levels .
let me show you another example .
you may think that this is just a landscape of a landscape , and it &apos;s the lower part of the brain .
but this is a picture of really completely frag@@ mented by photographs of different places .
i personally make fin@@ e@@ . that it &apos;s easier to create a place than finding a place , because you don &apos;t have to go into com@@ promis@@ es with the ideas in your head .
but it needs a lot to compu@@ te .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i would have spent several months to map them , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzz@@ les .
for example , the fish was taken on a gl@@ ori@@ ous tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory
the w@@ inner is from another place .
the under@@ water part comes out of a quar@@ ter-@@ line .
and yes , i &apos;ve even color@@ ed the house up on the island to look at it swe@@ dis@@ cher .
so to do a reali@@ stic out@@ come , it &apos;s kind of going out from me on planning .
i &apos;m always starting with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of the different images .
and here is a very good piece of appl@@ ying up here .
and when you make good recor@@ ds , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite reali@@ stic .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that &apos;s affected us is our imagination is our imagination
thanks very much .
so i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects failed .
and i think that the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to us to talk to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced on the bi@@ b@@ ou@@ d university was to make a major listen@@ er .
it doesn &apos;t really matter very scientific -- it provi@@ des a c@@ up of coffee or a te@@ a , and you ask the patient , families , rela@@ tives , rela@@ tives , &quot; how is it going ? &quot;
how are we going to help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to think that this is one of the main problems why everybody -- maybe most of the electr@@ onic health projects are missing , because we stopped listening .
this is my wh@@ and@@ age age . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a butt@@ on , he &apos;s got a butt@@ on .
and every single morning , i &apos;ll jump for it .
and yeah , i have a task , which you may recognize .
i &apos;ve ad@@ ded my job at 95 pounds .
it &apos;s really easy to work : every time i go out on the prison , it invi@@ tes my data to google health .
and that is where they are also called my general doctor , so he can recognize where my current problem is , not just at the moment where i need car@@ di@@ ological support or something , but also to look at the past in which i need car@@ di@@ ological support or something , but also the past .
well , there &apos;s another one .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4@@ ,000 sig@@ ns on twitter .
so every single morning , i jump down to my wh@@ ale kitchen , and people are talking to me before i go in the car , &quot; to lunch only a little let@@ s@@ ession today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
but this is the first thing that can happen , because this is the kind of money that &apos;s going to happen , to help patients , to help patients , because that could be used to o@@ bes@@ ity , or it might be killing patients that are smo@@ king smo@@ ils .
but it may also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs , and to get them to play some kind of game to control their health .
by the next week , it comes to the market@@ place .
it &apos;s going to give you this little blood pressure refle@@ ction that you &apos;re looking at at a iphone or something .
and it &apos;s going to en@@ able people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to their doctor , and to share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , patients get into play . they can &apos;t just take control of control , they can be se@@ arch@@ ed on their own ship , but can also help us to help us care about the challenges of the challenges that are ahead of us , and the coal explosion of health care , double demand , etc . , etc .
make metho@@ ds that are easy to use , and begin to hu@@ ck@@ le patients in the team .
and they can do that by doing these kinds of metho@@ ds , but also by crow@@ d@@ source .
and one of the things that we did , i &apos;d like to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the navi@@ ga@@ tional systems in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know very pre@@ cis@@ ely where all the tu@@ mm@@ als are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ zing .
we know another place , where all the gas sta@@ tions are .
and sure enough , we can find fast food cha@@ ins .
but where would the next a@@ ed would be to help this patient ?
we wonder@@ ed around , and no one knew it .
no one knew where the next life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was at that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did a crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we &apos;ve created a website , and a crowd of people asked , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please share where he is , when he &apos;s up , &quot; and sometimes he &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds , they &apos;ve been repor@@ ted in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
the next step was to find the app@@ s to do it .
and we &apos;ve designed an i@@ pad ap@@ p .
we developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , exp@@ and@@ ed reality to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht , and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , your micro@@ -@@ com cell , to find the next a@@ f that can save life .
and by today , we don &apos;t want to be just as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , as the product is called , but also to imple@@ ment a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us as well .
and we &apos;d like to bring this up to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues all over the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us be@@ have like g@@ ware points to crow@@ d@@ source these a@@ e@@ ds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and you break somebody together , whether it &apos;s your own relationships or someone else , you can find something like this a@@ ed .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies all over the world are helping us to help us con@@ fir@@ ate these a@@ e@@ ds .
they may be in@@ spir@@ ing services , or techni@@ cian , for example , just to make sure that the publi@@ sh@@ ed a@@ f is still in its place .
so , please help us , and try to make it not just better , not only to make health , but take it in your hand .
thanks very much .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little star@@ d@@ p wants to get us to conser@@ ve for conser@@ vation , by ...
... this is true of crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing desire .
let me show you a quick video about what we &apos;re doing .
oh . so a moment .
it may take you until it &apos;s ho@@ ach@@ ed .
now -- we can just jump across this -- i &apos;m going to just jump out the video ...
no@@ pe .
this is not ...
all right .
sol@@ ar-@@ technology is ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to get a year out@@ time , and work in a context that &apos;s pretty much all about what they hate , what they &apos;re going to hate , we &apos;ve been working on working
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace of music for the computer ge@@ e@@ ks .
we choose some of the fel@@ lo@@ ws each year , and we &apos;re working with it to work with urban control .
instead of sending it to the third world , we send it in sou@@ th@@ il@@ ates .
and that &apos;s where they developed great app@@ s , worked with urban collabor@@ ators .
but what really makes you do is to show what &apos;s possible with technology today .
and so they meet al .
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
it looks like he &apos;s se@@ arch@@ ing for a date , but what he really is looking at is someone who &apos;s dro@@ pping him up when he &apos;s involved , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at brand@@ ing , because he &apos;s covered by a meter s@@ now when he &apos;s hit by a meter s@@ now .
how did he get to look at aid in this particular way ?
we had a team in boston last year , a team of pla@@ lo@@ ws in boston , the code for america .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it was a lot of ru@@ g@@ ger@@ ing last febru@@ ary .
and they realized that the city never li@@ f@@ ted these hy@@ dr@@ ants .
but a distin@@ ctive fellow , a man named ge@@ ik photograph@@ er , noticed another thing , and it was that the resi@@ dents were fall@@ ing down the se@@ a@@ ks , right in front of these parts .
so he did what every great develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p , where you can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te a hy@@ dr@@ ant .
you &apos;re afraid to s@@ wal@@ low it , if it &apos;s s@@ wee@@ ping .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and it called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , someone can take it away to you .
so , there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a mo@@ dest piece of a jo@@ p .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ ert app@@ s , which has written the fel@@ lo@@ ws in the last year .
but it does something that no other govern@@ ance technology is doing .
it spre@@ ads rapi@@ dly .
there &apos;s this fellow in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . director of the city hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who has seen that he could use this ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but so the citizens of tsun@@ am@@ i adop@@ ts the american tsun@@ am@@ i si@@ r@@ ens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ am@@ ics are working , but people are ste@@ aling the bat@@ ter@@ ies .
and so he got the citizens to check it .
and then se@@ attle decided to use the ap@@ p to get the citizens to clean up the mar@@ ks of gol@@ l@@ ys .
and chicago has just launched it , so the people get rid of the bush slo@@ wer when it &apos;s s@@ wee@@ ping .
now we know nine cities that plan to use this ap@@ p .
and it has dec@@ lin@@ ed , organic , natural , of course .
you know , when you know about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually work that way .
software is taking a couple of years on the re@@ plac@@ ement of software
we had a team that worked last year on a project in boston for which three people needed two and a half months .
it was about a method where parents could find out what the right public schools are for their kids .
we talked later that if it was going to go across the normal chan@@ nel , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing even nothing .
there &apos;s a project right now in california , which the ta@@ yo@@ ut has already cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of govern@@ ance .
so an ap@@ p , which is written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spread by fear , is a kind of a m@@ ess before the government fin@@ ters the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like private companies , like a lot of people think it should .
and not even like a technology company , it &apos;s more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which is open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly about this ap@@ p is that she represents a new generation that makes the problem of the government -- not as the problem of promis@@ ed institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good thing , because it turns out that we are very good at collective terms with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who are making the tools that we need to make things effectively effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code to american lo@@ ws , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country who write up and govern@@ ance app@@ ners , every single day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t have the government to give up .
they &apos;re terri@@ bly fru@@ strated with her , but they don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ ase it , they re@@ pair it .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all feel your feelings about politics , and the pla@@ te in it , and you &apos;ve given all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rich@@ l@@ ly , &quot; which we do in common , we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given the government to go .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;ll ask you that you &apos;re thinking about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; it &apos;s the government in change .
and because the government ultimately has their power out of us -- let &apos;s remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , it &apos;s going to affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about the government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i felt that the government was main@@ ly about choo@@ sing people to vote into a invited .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to this conclu@@ sion that it &apos;s particularly local , in fact , to be ma@@ g-@@ attac@@ ks .
this is the call center for service and information .
and you typically come out where you &apos;re going to run in your city of 3@@ 11 .
if you &apos;ve ever had an opportunity to work in your own urban call center , like our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man , as part of the program -- in fact , do all of you -- you &apos;ll see that the people , the government for many different problems , including that there is a th@@ res@@ hold in your house .
so scot@@ t is going to get this open .
he &apos;s typ@@ ing &quot; clay rat@@ s &quot; into the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he begins with the animal &apos;s .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors in your house , and you play a very l@@ oud music , and see if the li@@ ve@@ stock sin@@ k ? &quot;
and this worked . appl@@ ause for scot@@ t .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the cour@@ cil .
boston did not just have a call center .
it has a ap@@ p , a web and cell ap@@ p , which is called &quot; vent@@ ure capture . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
and this is the work very smart people at the office of the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- it came in : &quot; sh@@ ir@@ y in my tr@@ ash . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how are i going to get it away ? &quot;
but what happened to citizens in the landscape is different .
scot@@ t was introduced by man to man .
but on citizens , it &apos;s all public publi@@ sh@@ ing , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it actually saw a neighb@@ or .
and the next post that we received was , &quot; i went over there , we found the land@@ fill behind the house .
&quot; yeah . live ? y@@ ap . y@@ ap . &quot;
the land@@ fill turned on the page . went home .
good night , swe@@ et th@@ um@@ ps . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is where digital is the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going into the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ce .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition here of the platform .
i &apos;ve been talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
a citi@@ zen was helping a different citi@@ zen , but the government played a central role here .
they lin@@ ked these two people .
and you &apos;d have to have them connect with government services , if that was needed , but a neighb@@ or is far better and che@@ aper partici@@ p@@ ating to state services .
if a neighb@@ or is helping the other , we &apos;re em@@ power@@ ing our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal beginn@@ ers , cost it a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think about government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think this is one of the input of the other .
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is vot@@ ing .
how often have we ele@@ cted a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we d@@ end back , and we expect the government , our values , our values , and our needs , and then it hasn &apos;t changed a lot ?
this is because the government is like a rise of ocean , and politics is the top 15@@ 7 .
and what &apos;s inside is , what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
and we use this word with such de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing .
but it &apos;s this promise that we have , which is this thing that we have , and that we pay for , is something that works against us , something else , and then we bring ourselves together .
the people seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
and if we want this institution to work for us , we have to do bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
because this is where the actual govern@@ mental work is happening .
we &apos;ve got to put ourselves on the govern@@ ance of the government .
so the re@@ py@@ tho@@ od movement has done it .
do you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of well-@@ emplo@@ ying citi@@ zen that has written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report , which is an answer to the temperature of the atmosphere of fin@@ ance re@@ form .
this is not poli@@ tically active , it &apos;s bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic .
well , for those of us who &apos;ve raised the government , it &apos;s time to think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to think about the complex challenges that you have to ask .
do we really think we &apos;re going to reach out what we need to do without understanding the institution that we all act about ?
a government is absolutely requi@@ red , but it needs to become more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le the function of the government , in a way that can actually achieve a difference by conne@@ cting society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up in the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build it all right .
well , the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so unfortunately , i &apos;m , unfortunately , more than one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that has grown up to see her voice as a result of gran@@ ted .
they don &apos;t fight that battle that we all care about , which is , who can talk to who speak ; they all survive .
you can make your mind on every single chan@@ nel at every time , and you do .
so , if you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that improve government &apos;s work .
and these app@@ s allow us to use our own hands to improve our communities .
this may be to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate a hy@@ dr@@ ant , s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed fro@@ gs , turn a tr@@ ash bow@@ l with a th@@ um@@ ber .
and sur@@ ely , we would have to burn these hy@@ dr@@ ants all the time , and a lot of people do this .
but these app@@ s are like small digital memory that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers re@@ stor@@ ing the ta@@ xes and the supply .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re a citi@@ zen .
and we &apos;re not going to be able to make government better until we improve govern@@ ance .
so , the question that i &apos;ve all got to talk to you about here is , when it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , are we going to be a number of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
so thank you .
in fact , my role is to explain to people how wonderful these new technologies , which are at the end of the day , are going to be here , and i thought , &quot; because i &apos;m here , i &apos;m really thinking about my friends , i &apos;d tell you what i really think , and also trying to look back and understand what &apos;s really happening here , with those incredible spr@@ ings , which is why we can har@@ dly possibly do it .
so i &apos;m going to start showing you a single , bor@@ ing slide , to show you
... maybe you &apos;ll show you the slide .
this is a slide that i acci@@ dent@@ ally cho@@ se from my cre@@ ator .
i &apos;m not talking about the details of the slide , but rather , the general shape .
this slide shows data of a analysis of us about the power of ris@@ c process@@ ors with the performance of an agri@@ cultural area network .
now , what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , as some of us , that we often have in our field , will be a kind of a se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve in our field .
in other words , each step up here is a poten@@ cy in the performance scale .
and this is a new sense that we need to use this type of scale to se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you want to get that light back again .
something else , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper like this .
now , why are we going to draw graph@@ s on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves ?
and the reason for this is , if i &apos;m drawing it on a normal cur@@ ve , where , say , this is the years , let &apos;s say , this is the last year , so this is a random measure of technology , which i &apos;m going to image with a graph , the graph is al@@ ber@@ n .
and they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to draw a different technology , let &apos;s say a transpor@@ tation technology , then this would be very un@@ reas@@ on@@ able on the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ial scale , in shape of a flat line .
but when something happens like this , it &apos;s changing the quality of quality .
so if the transpor@@ tation technology would continue as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology , then we could go back to a tax@@ i , and in 30 seconds , we &apos;d be in to@@ k@@ yo .
but that &apos;s not going to be so fast .
this has never been in history history , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth , which is the kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth , which is exponenti@@ ally increasing for all hundreds of years .
now the question that i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you &apos;ll see , they don &apos;t go out forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is evol@@ ving for forever and forever as fast as now .
there are two op@@ tions .
either it &apos;s going to be a classi@@ c t-@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something else comes out of it , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s what it is .
now , i &apos;m a opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think something like this is going to happen in the way that it &apos;s going to happen
that &apos;s really the way , then we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
we are here on this line , in a transition from the world of the world to a new kind of world .
so the question that i want to ask , and i often often ask myself , is how do this new world will be ?
what is this new condition that &apos;s going to slow the world ?
because the transition seems to be very , very conf@@ used when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what was going to happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still born in the year 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go further than we &apos;re going .
so in other words , the future is dec@@ lin@@ ed every year since i am in this world .
i think the reason for this is that we realize that there is something in the wrong place .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that there is simply no sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is so different to the future , because everything is so different about what we &apos;re doing now , we &apos;re not making sense .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about what this might be like , this transition that we &apos;re currently at right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk first about some other things that really don &apos;t have anything to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to step back and look at what &apos;s going on at a longer time scale .
and i &apos;d like to look at this at the time scale of the earth &apos;s life .
i think the big picture gives sense when you divi@@ de it up in a number of billions of times .
so let &apos;s go back , and this is 2.@@ 5 billion years . the earth was a big , ster@@ i@@ le stone pen with many of them flo@@ ating chemicals .
so , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they put it .
i also believe there are theor@@ ies that start understanding how everything works with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ stic story about which , at that time period , little oil dro@@ ps , which had different kinds of reci@@ pes for chemicals .
some of those oil dro@@ ps exi@@ sted a special combin@@ ation of chemicals , which allowed them to integra@@ te other chemicals from out@@ comes and grow .
all of them who were like this started to divi@@ de .
and these little oil dro@@ ps were the most primi@@ tive cell form .
but these oil dro@@ ps were not about living in today &apos;s sense , because each one of them was just a small , random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
and every time it divi@@ ded , it has to distribu@@ te its small@@ -@@ limit@@ ed chemicals into the ground .
so every one of them was a little bit different .
in fact , the dri@@ ll@@ s , which had one for the growth of lar@@ br@@ ure , had more than others , and integr@@ ated more and more chemicals , and they divi@@ ded faster and more chemicals .
so that pro@@ pos@@ als to survive longer , and they multi@@ p@@ ly in tremendous ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interest@@ ingly it &apos;s going to be a trick of abstra@@ ction on abstra@@ ction .
in a way that we don &apos;t quite understand , that dri@@ ll has the ability to write information , the ability to write information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the pres@@ cri@@ ption of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , they found a way in this vi@@ cious , evolutionary way that allowed them to write de@@ bt what they were made out of , so that this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ i@@ ed .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information to commer@@ ce information over the period of 2.@@ 5 billion years ago , where it came out , is the same thing .
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same writing .
and of course , every organis@@ m uses exactly the same letter and the same code .
we are so far that we can write just for the pleasure of the code itself in this code .
and i have here 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of a white pul@@ ge , which i try to keep on air@@ por@@ ts of security in air@@ por@@ ters .
and it is -- what i did is , i took this code -- the code is made out of normal letter , which we use to symbo@@ li@@ ze to architecture -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i practic@@ ed it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody is a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a sel@@ fish , then i would have written it on a virus and put it in the room .
so , what is the next step ?
the de@@ ad@@ line of the dna was an interesting step .
and that would give these cells -- it made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and this is where these cells started to communicate and exchange information , so that communities of cells emer@@ ged from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew this already , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
it &apos;s also why , for example , the in@@ sur@@ ance to antibio@@ tics is growing .
some bacteria have figured out how they can stay away from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and they &apos;ve written these information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria , which is resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now , this communication allowed the case of communities , which was in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were sy@@ ner@@ ge@@ tic .
so they were either survi@@ ving together , or they were going out together , which meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals were increasingly repe@@ aten and pre@@ fer@@ red by evolution .
now the transition point is where these communities were so close to each other that they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community into a drawing chain on the dna .
and the next thing took about another billion years was about another billion years .
at this point , we &apos;ve got multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of many different cell types , which together acts as individual organis@@ m .
in fact , we are such a multi-@@ variety of community as well .
we have a lot of cells that are no longer being asked on themselves .
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started evol@@ ving , so that the level in which evolution was achie@@ ved , no longer the single cell , but the entire cell community , which we call the organis@@ m .
the next step happened now within these communities .
the cell communities began to abstra@@ ct information again .
and they developed special structures , which did nothing other than process@@ ing information within the organis@@ m .
and these are the neu@@ ral structures .
so the neurons are the information process@@ ing site , which these cell communities have built .
they started educ@@ ating speci@@ alists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and looking at information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
and this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that moment , an individual -- learning right now within the period of the day of a single organis@@ m , rather than this evolutionary period of time .
so a organis@@ m could learn , for example , to eat a particular fru@@ it , because she made it bad and made him sick , the last time she ate her .
now , this could happen within the li@@ fes@@ pan of a single organis@@ m , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be learned by the individuals that died because these information had to be learned by the individuals , because these information process@@ ing structures hadn &apos;t been there yet .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process with this particular information structures , because evolution could now find us in a single way .
it was able to take place in a time learning frame@@ work .
what happened then is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
so , as an example , the most el@@ abor@@ ate thing we know about these communication is human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , awful and conf@@ used idea in my head .
i &apos;m going to sit here and give you a defini@@ te sound from me , hop@@ ing to create a similar idea in your head , which has a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , conver@@ t it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produ@@ ces something very complicated into the minds of others .
so this is allo@@ wing us to work as a uni@@ fied organis@@ m .
and indeed , what we &apos;ve done is we , human human being , we &apos;ve started abstra@@ ct .
we &apos;re going through the same steps that several cell organisms have gone through -- the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds , how we &apos;re going to stop data .
the invention of language , for example , was a little step in that direction .
tele@@ ony , computer , video she@@ ets , c@@ d ro@@ ms , and so on , all of our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we &apos;ve built in our community to be able to hand@@ le this information .
and it conne@@ cts all of us together to something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today evolution can happen from micro@@ seconds in the time of micro@@ seconds .
you &apos;ve seen t@@ tom a little bit of evolutionary example where he has shown a little bit of evolution in the con@@ national program , right in front of its eyes .
so we &apos;ve sel@@ ec@@ ted the ti@@ me@@ al scale again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , ended up a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took a couple of hundred million years .
then the current steps , like language and so on , has dec@@ lin@@ ed less than a million years .
and those next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to be doing just a few decades .
the process gro@@ ws from itself and becomes , i think auto@@ -@@ cat@@ aly@@ zing is the word for this -- if something is integr@@ ating its change , it &apos;s a scale for something
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of explosion .
we &apos;re looking at the process that &apos;s being f@@ ed by itself .
i live in a lifetime of fig@@ uring out computers , and i know that i couldn &apos;t use the mechan@@ ism that i use to build computers , without the recent comple@@ tation of the computer technology .
my current job is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transi@@ st@@ or is doing in the inter@@ connec@@ tion machine .
and it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking are doing , is we think about a certain abstra@@ ction of abstra@@ ction , and we &apos;re thinking about this machine , and the machine makes it something that goes beyond our skills far more , better and faster than we could ever do it .
and it does it par@@ tly with metho@@ ds , which we don &apos;t even understand very well .
one way which is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve often used in time , is evolution itself .
and what we did was we put a evolutionary process in the machine , which is going on in the micro@@ -@@ second region .
so , to put an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evolved out of random in@@ struc@@ tions .
we &apos;re saying , &quot; computer , gener@@ ic dollars , you &apos;ve sel@@ ec@@ ted a hundred million points of infe@@
now , you &apos;re going to help all of these random infe@@ ctions , take action all programs , and choose the ones that my previous speak@@ ers are the first ones that i have . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;m going to tell you what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to take numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for it .
so this is programs that are the most common numbers that are going to track
of course , the od@@ ds at random are very small in@@ struc@@ tions that they &apos;re going to take a numbers on random , so probably none of the in@@ struc@@ tions will actually be doing this .
but one of those may be lucky to get two numbers into the right order .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; computer , take those 10 percent of the sequence , which is the first place that i &apos;ve come to see .
hold those up , give it the rest .
now all of the rest of it re@@ produ@@ ces the number of numbers that are best .
and with a method of re@@ combin@@ ation , anal@@ o@@ g to re@@ production . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ en , and the kids are em@@ bed@@ ding the properties of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that emer@@ ged by com@@ part@@ ments of programs , which are a little bit closer to the pres@@ ents than others .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot;
valu@@ ed them back .
so , leadership may be a few mu@@ tations .
and try this all the way to another generation .
all these generations cost only a few milli@@ seconds .
and so i can go through a evolution for millions of years on the computer in a few minutes , or in a more complex case .
at the end of the day , i &apos;m going to get programs that are perfectly different .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i ever could have described by hand .
and then when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
it &apos;s dis@@ pu@@ te and pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ful programs .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you have hundreds of thousands of programs coming out of a number of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because their life depen@@ ded on whether she was doing the job right .
i sat in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 , ellen , and he said , &quot; oh look , look . look at that .
it says , &quot; this plane is out of hundreds of thousands of small pieces , working together to make your wind sa@@ fer . &quot; don &apos;t do that to make sure that &apos;s impossible ? &quot;
we know that a process of development is not opti@@ mal when it gets too complicated .
so we &apos;re going to start on computers for a process , which is very different from the classi@@ cal engineering of engineering .
it allows us to be more higher than a much higher complexity than the normal metho@@ ds would allow us to produce
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of it .
so there is a lot of other things that we &apos;re going to see .
we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer much faster so that we &apos;re able to make those processes even faster .
so it creates feedback feedback .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so conf@@ used .
because all of these new technologies today are affec@@ ting themselves .
we &apos;re going down .
we have arrived at a moment , the anal@@ o@@ g is at once , as a sub-@@ cell organisms , has evolved into multi-@@ cell organisms .
so we are the po@@ o@@ ks , and we still can &apos;t do what the hell we &apos;re doing here are actually the way we &apos;re going to do it .
we are in the middle of this over@@ come .
but i really think that after us comes something else .
i think it &apos;s extremely diver@@ se from us to say that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going to happen next .
now , the lunch is before , and i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m listening to this now , before i &apos;m going to pick up .
my story is starting right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , about two years ago .
i was bene@@ ath the side sky in the desert with su@@ f@@ i sing@@ ers mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
we talked about the fact that nothing has changed since the era of the ancient indian epidemic of ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
if we wanted to travel in indian days , we jum@@ ped into a car and kno@@ ck over the sky .
now we &apos;re going to do this with air@@ planes .
at the time , when the great indian war@@ ri@@ prin@@ ce had allowed ar@@ ach@@ a , he took a bo@@ w , walked into the floor , and water .
now we &apos;re making it with dri@@ ll@@ ers and machines .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that the magic and magic of machines were re@@ placed by machines .
and i really loved that sad .
i got a little sc@@ ared of technology .
it was fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed that i could lose the ability to lose the sun@@ line without camera , without a camera , and without my friends .
i felt that technology should make magic possible , and not killing .
and when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver ta@@ ch@@ u .
this piece of 5@@ 0-@@ year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world full of pil@@ es and un@@ fortun@@ ated ships and pictures in my imagination .
it occur@@ red to me , when we had our che@@ cks and c@@ ameras on it , we were going to dream of it
and they kept us going to be inspired by that .
and so i set myself in the world of technology to see how i could use ma@@ me rather than killing it .
at age 16 , i started to illu@@ strate books .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as an instrument to story@@ telling , to connect the re@@ a@@ ders around the world .
it can know how we think it is .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing pictures and text together , anima@@ tion , sound and touch .
the story@@ telling has always used more sense .
but what are we going to do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to go to k@@ ho@@ ya , which is an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
this says , &quot; hold your fing@@ ers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s a box saying , &quot; this box is ... &quot; i &apos;m writing my name .
and i &apos;m going to make a character in the book .
once again , a letter for me falls down to me -- and the i@@ pad knows through gps where i live -- which is cor@@ rec@@ ted to me .
the child in me is really thri@@ ll@@ ed by such possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i mean not ma@@ er and dra@@ te , but the magic of the childhood , the ideas we all had as children .
fire@@ flies in a glass i &apos;ve always found very exciting .
and you have to ho@@ p the i@@ pad up here and leave the fire@@ flies out here .
and they kind of den@@ k the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascin@@ ated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put a single galaxy in a single mar@@ ket .
and so every book here is going to be a little mar@@ ket , and every world i &apos;m going to wra@@ p here to the magic device in the machine .
and so this op@@ ens a map .
fan@@ tas@@ y@@ books had always had maps , but these cards were sta@@ tic .
this map gro@@ ws and explo@@ ded and ser@@ ved and ser@@ ves to ori@@ ent into the rest of the book .
she &apos;s also showing other parts of the book .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
also , it &apos;s important to me to create something that is indian , but it &apos;s also very ti@@ me@@ y .
so this is the ap@@ sar@@ as .
we &apos;ve heard all of fe@@ es and n@@ y@@ mp@@ s , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were caught for thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers in an old mu@@ tter book .
and we bring them back to a con@@ temporary story for kids .
it &apos;s a story that spre@@ als with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
so , for the point of environmental crisis , a great problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , they don &apos;t go out to go out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book you &apos;re going to put on a search , you &apos;ve got to go out and collect the camera of the i@@ pa@@ l images of natural objects .
when i was a kid , i had colle@@ ctions of j@@ ars , st@@ ones , squ@@ at@@ ches and b@@ ells .
somehow , kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is a conversation that &apos;s brought back , and you &apos;ve got to go out and tag a picture of a flo@@ wer and tag it out of a flo@@ wer .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to photograph@@ er and tag a piece of tree z@@ ars .
and so you actually do a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put online .
a kid in london shows the image of a cre@@ ator , and he says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fo@@ wer today . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; today , i &apos;ve seen a mon@@ keys . &quot;
and this creates some kind of social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you &apos;ve actually photograph@@ ed .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that we have ma@@ gical , to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan an interaction where you use the video of the i@@ pa@@ ds , and by aug@@ mented reality , we see a anima@@ tion of ta@@ gs that appear on a plant front of the house .
in one place , the screen is fil@@ ling with she@@ ets .
you have to make the sound of the win@@ ds , b@@ ind them away and read the rest of the book .
we all move around a world where the natural nature of technology comes closer and closer to the magic and technology and the technology .
we &apos;re using the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids to the natural world and to the magic world and the magic and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thanks very much .
this is a really extraordinary honor to me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , pris@@ ons , or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the most so@@ cially afraid in the social assem@@ bly community and places where there &apos;s a lot of hope .
and being here at ted , watching and hearing how stimul@@ ta@@ tive this is , has given me a lot of force .
in the short days here , i got a clear impres@@ sion : ted has a identity .
you can say things that have influence around the world .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and a force that otherwise it doesn &apos;t have any meaning .
i say that , because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but the words of a de@@ dic@@ ated student are particularly meaning@@ ful .
you know , as a doctor , you can do good , but you can do a more good doctor , but you can still do more .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t do that in my work as a law@@ yer , by the way .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african wild@@ being hou@@ se@@ hold , which was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ir@@ in , and this matri@@ ir@@ in was my grandmother .
she was a ta@@ st@@ le , a strong woman , she had a responsibility .
she had the last word in every family argu@@ ment .
she was also the starting point in our family as well .
she was the kid of a sla@@ ve family .
their parents were born in virg@@ ini@@ a as a sla@@ ve in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s .
she was born by 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very sha@@ ped her world &apos;s experience very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also really trou@@ bled .
when i met her as a baby boy , she came up up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
she made me feel that i har@@ dly brea@@ the , and then she left me up .
and one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up up to me and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you feel my ni@@ ction ? &quot;
and when i said no , they hu@@ ck me again , and if i said , &quot; yes , i dro@@ ve me . &quot;
she was something that made you wish that you wanted to be in your head .
the only diffic@@ ul@@ ty was that she had 10 kids .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 kids .
sometimes , if i was going to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention to me .
my cou@@ s@@ ins travel@@ ed around all the way .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i would wake up one morning and went to the living room , all my cou@@ s@@ ins fell around the street .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room , and he star@@ ed at me .
i thought that was a game that would be a game .
i looked at her and s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious .
and that went to me 15 or 20 minutes , and then she walked up and she came over to me , she took me over , she said , &quot; come , br@@ y@@ an . you and i have to talk . &quot;
i still remember , like , it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
she took me outside and he said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you &apos;re not going to stand it up . &quot;
i said , &quot; forget , gran@@ ted , gran@@ ny . &quot;
and she said , &quot; hon@@ ey word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down to me , and he looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;m watching you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re doing something special . &quot;
and she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , gran@@ ny . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , you &apos;re going to love your m@@ ess always . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mother is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to promise with promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of it . &quot;
i ad@@ mi@@ red my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , gran@@ ny , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next , let me tell you that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to avoid doing the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yes , gran@@ ny , i promise it . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to promise me is &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , gran@@ ny . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up in the country , in the old south , and i have a brother who is older , who is older a year , and a year yo@@ unger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and brought this 28 bow@@ o be@@ er with my sister and me , and walked with us in the forest .
we just s@@ mil@@ ed around the way in which we are .
and then he took a bright be@@ cker and off@@ ered my sister one , and she took it , and then she sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . ok . just don &apos;t want to . i don &apos;t want a be@@ er . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do it today , you &apos;re going to do anything that we do .
i had what , you had your sister . go , drin@@ k a be@@ er . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it . just just do it . &quot;
my brother was star@@ ing at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh , no , you don &apos;t even do crazy because of the conversation with gran@@ ted with gran@@ ny ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grand@@ ma tells all the ti@@ cks that you are special . &quot;
i was destro@@ ying the floor .
i &apos;m going to be a bit of you .
i probably should not do that .
this may be trans@@ mit@@ ted by publi@@ c@@ ly .
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i feel like i &apos;ve never che@@ cked a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s virtu@@ ous . i say that , because identity is power .
if we make the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t think they &apos;re at first
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all of her grand@@ children , of course , they &apos;re special .
my grand@@ father was in ja@@ il during the pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
my un@@ cle died of al@@ co@@ hol infe@@ cted diseases .
and she believed that this is the top@@ ics that we had to take care of .
i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people were in circu@@ lation and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states today has the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate of the world .
seven million people are de@@ dic@@ ated to jud@@ ren@@ cy , or by lack of fi@@ ority .
in my opini@@ on , mass in@@ fu@@ ti@@ zes our world has changed fundament@@ ally .
in social cool@@ ers and black parts of the population of des@@ pair des@@ pair and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of these changes .
one out of three blan@@ k black between 18 and 30 is in soli@@ d , in prison , on cur@@ ren@@ cy , or with limited pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles over phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in rich , in prison , on cur@@ ren@@ cy , or with limited pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation .
but our system is going to be not just designed by questions that have to do with race , it &apos;s also being dis@@ placed by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that treated much better when they &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and un@@ for@@ ge@@ ence .
responsibility , not de@@ for@@ ir@@ ors , affec@@ ts the out@@ come .
yet , we seem to be wrong with it .
a politics of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
and there are a couple of very interesting develop@@ ments .
my home state of al@@ ab@@ ama is acc@@ ag@@ hing them rapi@@ dly , when they &apos;re pro@@ posed to be attac@@ ked .
here in al@@ ab@@ ama today , 3@@ 4 percent of men &apos;s black population is rapi@@ dly losing their vote .
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of re@@ vie@@ vation is going to be as high as the world &apos;s mind is going to pass out of vot@@ ing legal rights .
the sil@@ ence is o@@ ft@@ -@@ shar@@ pping .
i promis@@ ed kids .
a lot of my off@@ ers are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that con@@ tains three-@@ 10@@ -year-old children to death in prison .
in this country , there are dea@@ ths of life in our country for children without limited pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation .
we &apos;ve already travel@@ ed a lot of progress .
the only country in the world .
i was teaching people in death cells .
the question of death pen@@ al@@ ty is a very interesting question .
we think that because you &apos;ve taught it so that the real question is , did a human being deser@@ ves to die for him to die ?
and this is a very powerful question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other aspe@@ ct of it is not that anybody deser@@ ves a state for a crime , but is we deser@@ ve to kill it ?
i think this is fascinating .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty in america defin@@ es itself by er@@ r@@ ation .
on nine people we ex@@ ecu@@ ted , one that we have preser@@ ved for inno@@ cent , which has been dis@@ mis@@ sed and dis@@ placed from the death of death .
an amazing failure . one of the nine inno@@ cent cases .
i think this is fascinating .
we would never let anybody fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , they shu@@ t up , they cut one .
but somehow we &apos;re going to do it by setting ourselves out of this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race , and the question is whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m contribu@@ ting my students of abra@@ ro@@ american history , and i &apos;m talking about sla@@ very .
i &apos;m talking about terror@@ ism , the time at the end of re@@ construction , up to the beginning of the 2@@ th-@@ century war ii .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for afri@@ can@@ americans in this country , it was a time of ter@@ ror .
in a lot of places , people had to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed by ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs .
or you can see bom@@ bs .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror who was sha@@ king her life .
these old people come to me now and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they talk , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re saying , &quot; you know , we need to stop saying that for the first time in the history of our nation , we have to stop doing terror@@ ism for the first time in our nation
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terror@@ ism , of course , the ta@@ pe , and decades of the most motiv@@ ated sub@@ pres@@ entation and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
and yet , in our country , we don &apos;t like to speak a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions have in the histor@@ ical context .
we &apos;re constantly pus@@ hing up together .
we always do new ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
we &apos;re very hard to talk about race , and i think it &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to approach the process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in south africa , the people understood that the reti@@ re@@ ment is not over@@ come , without truth to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
even after the geno@@ cide , in r@@ wand@@ a , there was this battle , but not in that of our country .
i &apos;ve given a few talks in germany about death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply stupid to hear it . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and , of course , they can never give it more . &quot;
it got a sil@@ ence . and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ve ever re@@ fer@@ red to the syste@@ matic kill of people .
it would be anno@@ y@@ ful of us , consci@@ ously , to be aware of people . &quot;
i was thinking about it .
how it appe@@ ars to live in a world where the ger@@ man state fell in humans , especially if there were im@@ propor@@ tions of un@@ propor@@ tional je@@ ws .
it would be in@@ per@@ su@@ able .
it would be tru@@ sting .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states of the old south , we &apos;re going to go to people -- here is the risk of being sent@@ enced to death , at 11 times when the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce is white than when it &apos;s black -- when it &apos;s black -- and the vic@@ tim knows -- in the same state , in whose soil , where the body &apos;s bodies are sha@@ ped by the body .
and yet , there is this mental limit@@ ation .
i think our identity is being thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these difficult the@@ mes , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation as we know .
we love technology , creativity and creativity .
we &apos;re love entertain@@ ment .
but in the end , these reali@@ ties are over@@ lin@@ ed by suffering , ab@@ use , em@@ per@@ ation , ex@@ ecu@@ tion .
i think it &apos;s important to uni@@ te both of them .
because what we end up talking about is that we need more hope , more engagement , more commit@@ ment , to be in a complex world .
to me , it means to get time , to think about and talk about the poor , the people who are never going to be at ted .
but think in a way that &apos;s being em@@ bed@@ ded in our own life .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . that &apos;s as rational as we esti@@ mate the intelle@@ ct of emotions .
innovation , creativity , and development aren &apos;t just coming out of our minds .
they come from ideas that are driven by per@@ su@@ asi@@ ven@@ ess in our he@@ arts .
it &apos;s this head@@ day heart connection , which i think it kill@@ s us , not just being open for all the bright and clo@@ sing things , but also for the dark and proble@@ matic and proble@@ matic .
so vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ gen@@ a , the great kit@@ m politi@@ cian , once said .
&quot; when we f@@ ought in eastern europe against op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted to do everything , but what we most need was hope , a spi@@ ritual ori@@ entation , the will@@ ing@@ ness , sometimes to be in hop@@ eless places , the will@@ ing@@ ness , sometimes to be wit@@ er places . &quot;
that spi@@ ritual ori@@ entation is the core of what i believe the ted community also needs to emplo@@ y for .
there is no sub@@ stance about technology and design that allows us to be completely human , unless we have e@@ ars , and e@@ ars for poverty , ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te and in@@ justice .
i want to war@@ n you , and this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we weren &apos;t talking about it .
she &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
and as a young law@@ yer , i hat@@ ed the great privi@@ lege to meet p@@ ink par@@ ks .
woman par@@ ks always came back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery , where she was two of her ol@@ dest friends tra@@ f@@ ted , these el@@ der@@ ly women , church never car@@ r , who had organized the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ ot@@ t bush bo@@ y@@ k@@ ot@@ t -- an incredible african american -- and virg@@ ini@@ a perman@@ r , a white man whose husband , cli@@ ck@@ ord dr@@ r .
so these women were running around , and they were just holding themselves .
and then , mother car@@ r called me , and he said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , son par@@ ks come into the city . we want to pay attention .
do you want to come up and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , it &apos;s really like me .
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen to sleep . &quot;
and i went over and i just listen@@ ed to .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so it &apos;s so in@@ spir@@ ing .
and one day i sat there and listen@@ ed to these women , and after a couple of hours , my par@@ ks turned to me and said , &quot; well br@@ y@@ an , tell me what that meant is the initiative for real &quot; right .
what is going to try to achieve it ? &quot;
i started with my usual lec@@ ture .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go out for ine@@ justice .
w@@ r : people want to help people who were inno@@ cent .
we want to fight agen@@ cies and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al justice system .
we want to elimin@@ ate li@@ fel@@ ong sent@@ ences without a de@@ dic@@ ation of life .
we want to get a little bit against death pen@@ al@@ ty companies .
we want to reduce the number of g@@ ap@@ s .
we want to elimin@@ ate mass in@@ car@@ ger@@ ies . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and after@@ wards she looked at me and said , &quot; hu@@ h . m@@ h@@ mm . m@@ h@@ mm . &quot;
she said , &quot; this is going to make it very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
and then mother car@@ r emp@@ ited up to me , put a finger on my face , and she said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very ta@@ st@@ le . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be ta@@ d@@ ges .
we need to connect more resources : these problems , that de@@ ad@@ line .
because ultimately , our humanity , by our humanity , is depen@@ dent .
i learned very simple things in my work , quite simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst stuff we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
when someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a li@@ ar .
if somebody is taking something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to him , he &apos;s not just a box .
even who kill@@ s anybody , it &apos;s not just a mur@@ derer .
and because that is , there is a basic human being who has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of the country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s .
i think in many places , i think the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dra@@ matic , so beautiful and in@@ spir@@ ing , and so resili@@ ent , we ultimately end up meas@@ uring out not in our technology , not to the things that we develop , not in our intelle@@ ct , and minds .
finally , a society will not measure how they treated their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but about how they rel@@ ate to the poor , the in@@ scri@@ pi@@ ates .
because in this context , we &apos;re going to start thinking about the most amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;m going to lose that balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i ta@@ st@@ le too much .
i &apos;m going to be ti@@ red , as we all .
sometimes these ideas are predic@@ ting our thinking of thinking in a very important way .
i was teaching these kids who were very hard to be ma@@ pped by .
i go to the coun@@ cil and i visit a las@@ ant who may be 13 or 14 years old , and who is to be a grow@@ l@@ ant of court .
and then i wonder@@ ed , well , how could this happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn someone into something that it isn &apos;t ?
the ju@@ dge looks at it as an adult , but i see a child .
i sta@@ yed too long one night , and i thought , my goo@@ dness , if a ju@@ dge can turn us into something else , then he has to have ma@@ ma@@ cy forces .
in fact , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has ma@@ g@@ ged ma@@ mor@@ o .
you &apos;d want to have some of them .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think very much anymore , i started working on a pres@@ entation .
i had a 14@@ year-old , poor black boys as a man@@ l@@ ant .
and i started with this note . the head@@ line said , &quot; mission , my poor , 14@@ -year-old black man , like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old top man . &quot; pengu@@ . &quot;
in my pres@@ entation , i expla@@ ined that mis@@ abilities of the state of state and police and the police were fail@@ ing and re@@ stor@@ ing failure .
there was a crazy line about that , that in this country , there was nothing more about the fact that there are still failed behavior .
the next morning i wo@@ ke up , i didn &apos;t know if i &apos;d just dre@@ am@@ ed this crazy as@@ sign@@ ment or actually writing him .
and to my de@@ fau@@ lt , i didn &apos;t just write it , but i sent him to the court as well .
there was a couple months ahead of the day , and i just had for@@ gotten .
and finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to give you the cour@@ ts@@ hi@@ p , and i &apos;m going to give you a crazy
i got into the car , and i was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
so i went to the cour@@ ge .
and i thought , well , it &apos;s going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
i ended up going out of my car , and i went up the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court .
when i got the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court , there was an el@@ der , black man , the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds in the court .
and when he saw me , he came up with me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and he came up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
then he ste@@ pped me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it tou@@ ched something deeply deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribu@@ te every single community to a community &apos;s perspective , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the cour@@ k@@ room .
and as soon as the ju@@ dge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you put this crazy show ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to disc@@ uss .
more and more people would come in , just because they were an@@ gry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and volunte@@ ers and off@@ ers and office employees .
in the case , the cour@@ ch@@ room of people who were an@@ gry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality .
so from my eye , i saw the jan@@ it@@ ors up and down and down .
he always looked through the window , and he was listening to the whole to@@ hu@@ li@@ h@@ u .
and he went up and down .
and finally , this old black man came out in the cour@@ k@@ room with a very cher@@ ch@@ y face in the cour@@ k@@ room , and he was sitting behind me , almost to the defen@@ se bank .
10 minutes later , the ju@@ dge announ@@ ced a break .
and during the break , a police off@@ ic@@ er in which it was a nur@@ sing that the jan@@ it@@ ors were in the cour@@ ial room .
and this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you going to do in the cour@@ ts@@ room ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come out to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the goal out of my eyes . don &apos;t give it up . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pen@@ g@@ y of the universe is far more than it is , but it &apos;s going to increase justice .
that we &apos;re not completely evol@@ ving as humans , as long as we don &apos;t consider human rights and basic values .
that our survival is associated with survival every single person &apos;s survival .
that we have to connect our visi@@ ons of technology and design , of entertain@@ ment and creativity , with humanity , p@@ ity and justice .
and most of all , what i &apos;d like to do is just look at those of you who are just like , don &apos;t lose the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you have seen this audience , this community , an obvious wish , and you &apos;ve heard to help them .
what else can we do ?
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are ways to be .
if you live in california , in this spring , there is a her@@ bi@@ cal decision where it &apos;s about designing an effort to re@@ cover something from the money stream that otherwise flo@@ ws in the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
here in california , for example , in california , you &apos;re going to emplo@@ y a billion dollars for death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years .
and yet , at the end of 4@@ 6 percent of all sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce , it doesn &apos;t invol@@ ve a con@@ temp@@ li@@ ation .
ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ six percent of the ra@@ pe cases don &apos;t come from court .
here is the opportunity to do something .
this is a pres@@ ence that &apos;s going to pro@@ pose to invest the money in more security and safety .
i think there are possibilities everywhere .
over the last three decades , crimin@@ al rates of crime in america is im@@ men@@ se .
and the fact is , often , in a context with the increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers .
what would you say to someone who belie@@ ves this ?
well , actually , the number of violence in violence has not changed very much .
most of the mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country didn &apos;t really find in the classroom of violence .
it was the failed rou@@ te of drugs against drugs .
and so the dra@@ matic high numbers are coming at the prison in pris@@ ons .
we sat down from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
now we have &quot; three-@@ -@@ assem@@ bly &quot; the laws that people get for , for a bi@@ ke the@@ ft , for example , for the the@@ ft bit of tiny good good , rather than that you force them to give the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces back .
i think we have to do more to help people who have become vic@@ ti@@ ms of an offen@@ sion , not less .
and i think our current pun@@ ish@@ ment compassion helps no one to help .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
br@@ y@@ an , they &apos;ve really got a taste here to ho@@ ok .
they &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
ow@@ n : death provi@@ des a higher car risk with itself .
in som@@ alia , fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . in fact , in 2006 , the police spra@@ y spra@@ y of police .

rec@@ ession : sil@@ ence . do@@ om@@ s@@ r . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a .
crisis . death . cat@@ ure .
oh , my go@@ sh@@ ens .
so , these are just some of the cli@@ ps i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the last six months -- it may have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media pre@@ fer to show us normal the@@ mes , because our minds are very attention to the same top@@ ics .
and there &apos;s a very good reason to do that .
every second of every second , our senses begin to start a lot more information than our brain ever starts .
and because nothing is more important than our survival , the first one is for all of the information for all of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ bes , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our com@@ men@@ dation dete@@ ctor .
it inter@@ f@@ ers , and it takes away all of the information in search of dan@@ ger of dan@@ ger in our surro@@ und@@ ens .
so , when we see the news , we pre@@ fer to look for negative news .
and the old ada@@ ge , when it flo@@ ws , the demand ris@@ es , is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices , which are seven days a week , 24 hours a day , all of these negative mes@@ sages , it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that everybody thinks it &apos;s worse to the world as well .
but maybe that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century through a series of forces , is so strong that it will be possible for us in the next three decades to create a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , dom@@ esti@@ c kill@@ s , water and energy problems -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we are much better at seeing problems in a very long way , but they &apos;re over@@ come to over@@ come .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved in the last century , so that we can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te development .
over the last hundred years , average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has more than dou@@ bled , which is the average population of the world population has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
child mortality has dec@@ lin@@ ed by a tent@@ h of mortality .
it comes out that the diet , electricity transpor@@ tation and communication costs have a multi@@ pli@@ city of a multi@@ pli@@ city
steve pin@@ ker has shown us that we are currently living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history .
and charles ken@@ ny , according to the last 1@@ 30 years , has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent of the disease .
we are living in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget this .
and we &apos;re going to increase our expec@@ tations all the time .
in fact , we &apos;ve re@@ defined poverty .
remember that a great percentage of americans living under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , telev@@ isi@@ ons , telev@@ esti@@ pers , cell phones , the motor products and cars .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists of the last century , the im@@ per@@ ators of the earth , would have never been able to dream as an a@@ ung@@ ent .
the foundation for many of them develop@@ s are technologies , and they &apos;re growing ex@@ poten@@ si@@ vely .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown us that every tool that is going to be information technology , at the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and the price performance of state qu@@ o@@ ti@@ ent is dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times fewer , and it &apos;s thousands of times faster than a super@@ computer computer computer super@@ computer .
now take a look at that cur@@ ve .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law of over the last hundred years .
notice about two things on that cur@@ ve .
first of all , how smo@@ king it -- in good times , war or peace , rec@@ ession , depression , and high-@@ assem@@ bly , depression and high-@@ assem@@ bly .
this is the result of faster computers , which are faster computers to build .
it &apos;s slo@@ wed down for no of our big problems .
and also , despite your log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic process on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , it &apos;s going to go up@@ ward .
so the growth rate itself is acceler@@ ating .
and on this cur@@ ve , on the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of us .
&quot; clou@@ d-@@ computing , &quot; which is something that i call my friends at auto@@ des@@ k computing , sensor@@ s and networks , robots , 3d prin@@ ters that allow it to democra@@ ti@@ ze personal production on our planet , syn@@ thetic biology , fuel , vac@@ cin@@ ation and food , nan@@ o-@@ materials , nan@@ o-@@ materials , nan@@ o-@@ materials and artificial
how many of you have seen the vic@@ tory of the ib@@ m of super@@ -@@ computer wat@@ son at risk ?
and that was a nice thing .
i was going through the new@@ spa@@ pers and looking at the best head@@ lines that i could find .
i love this one : &quot; wat@@ son is as@@ ham@@ ed with human ad@@ als . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
so , imagine that this artificial intelligence of every mobile phone ow@@ ner has to have a mobile phone
four years ago , ray kurz@@ weil launched , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university called &quot; sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university . &quot;
we bring our students all the way through all of these technologies where they can take advantage of how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we &apos;re asking the students to create companies and products and services that are bene@@ ficial within a decade in a decade of billions of people in the course of billions of people
remember that a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people today .
30 years ago , it would have been ridi@@ cul@@ ously wrong .
today , we can sam@@ strate to do@@ zens of companies that have made this exactly done .
when i think about doing ab@@ und@@ ance , i mean not a life full of lux@@ ury to everybody on the planet , and i &apos;m about to create a life of opportunity .
it &apos;s about creating the amount of goods of sur@@ plus .
sc@@ ar@@ city is con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resource of liber@@ ating force .
let me show you an example .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ ii in the middle of the 18@@ th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king from the si@@ dge to dinner .
na@@ po@@ le@@ an soldiers got sil@@ ver bri@@ p@@ ck , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself had gol@@ d-@@ be@@ ar@@ ed .
but the king of angel@@ on , though , had become al@@ umin@@ um her@@ sen@@ gle .
al@@ umin@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and she@@ am@@ ent@@ y .
this is why the dom@@ e of the washington mon@@ um@@ ere was made out of al@@ umin@@ um .
now while al@@ umin@@ um al@@ umin@@ um takes 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a p@@ ure metal .
it &apos;s lin@@ ked by oxygen and si@@ le .
but then the technology of electro@@ mo@@ sis was developed , and made al@@ umin@@ um produ@@ ces so cheap that we use it with our tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory ment@@ ality .
and then we project this analog@@ y once into the future .
we &apos;re thinking today about energy sc@@ ar@@ city .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet that is 40@@ ,000 times more energy than we use in a planet .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ wat@@ is@@ wat@@ es of energy , every 8@@ 8 minutes on the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not bal@@ ity , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ bility .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , for the first time , you &apos;ve managed to reduce the cost of solar electricity in india to 50 percent of the same stream -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
the cost of solar energy dro@@ pped by 50 percent last year .
last month , this has been published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sun@@ ny areas of the united states in the sun@@ ny areas of the united states , solar@@ cents per pi@@ w@@ h is going to cost a national average .
and if we have a energy over@@ put , then we also will have water in ab@@ und@@ ance .
so let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember car@@ l sa@@ gan the vo@@ y@@ a@@ ger spac@@ ec@@ raft in 199@@ 0 when it went to saturn at the hori@@ zon , went back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it be ?
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
because we are living on a water planet .
we live on a planet , which is 7@@ 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent of sal@@ t@@ water , two percent , and we &apos;re fighting by 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there are hope .
and there are new technologies , not in about 10 or 20 years , but now .
they &apos;re new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ologi@@ cs on the way , and they &apos;re nan@@ o-@@ materials .
and from a conversation this morning with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ators of the will , i wanted to share something with you -- he gave me per@@ mission -- his technolog@@ ist , the &quot; sl@@ ing@@ age , &quot; which many of you may have heard about . it &apos;s the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator in the dor@@ d-@@ home classroom .
it can produce a thousand li@@ t of clean water per day from multiple sources -- whether sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- and all of that for less than 2 cents a gall@@ on .
the front of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just been introduced to laun@@ ch a very big project with a hundred un@@ its in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , then co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a is going to apply this technology glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries across the planet .
this is technology &apos;s innovation , which is available today .
and we &apos;ve seen this with mobile phones .
you know my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent redu@@ ction rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 20@@ 13 .
just consider that a mas@@ sa@@ i war@@ cher with a cell cell in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communic@@ ations than president re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
and if you search with your smar@@ t@@ phone on google , you have more access to knowledge , and information as president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in ab@@ und@@ ance , which nobody would ever have predi@@ cted .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you have and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , h@@ d video and photo , libr@@ aries full of books and music , and technology , and medical diagno@@ stics , technology -- now produ@@ c@@ tively , and che@@ aper in your cell phone .
and the best part is perhaps what it expe@@ cts us in health care .
and last month , i had the pleasure with the quality foundation called the &quot; $ 10 &quot; ful@@ l-@@ milli@@ -@@ com@@ posite tri@@ cor@@ der x prize .
we challenge teams all over the world to connect all these technologies in a mobile phone like this , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s written by ai , you can test fla@@ king , or your blood value .
and in order to win , the device needs to put a better diagno@@ sis than a team em@@ bed@@ ded physi@@ cians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care workers .
and if this device is sequen@@ cing a box or a dna virus , which is not known , it &apos;s going to collapse the secre@@ t@@ ary , and pre@@ vent@@ ing a pan@@ de@@ mic before it comes down .
but now , to the biggest force , which is going to lead us to a world of trans@@ mu@@ tions .
i call it &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for the population .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ on-@@ the-@@ dollar mark .
and by the way , the biggest ad@@ sur@@ ance against a population radi@@ ation is a better education and a diet in the world .
in 2010 , we &apos;ve only had two billion people inter@@ connected with each other .
by 20@@ 20 , we &apos;re going to go from two to five billion internet users .
three billion new parents that we &apos;ve never heard before are going to stop global communic@@ ations .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consu@@ me ? what are they going to consu@@ me ?
and instead of more econom@@ ful , i see one of the biggest economic dis@@ hes in history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they become heal@@ thi@@ ed by the use of the tri@@ co@@ der , and they &apos;re better trained by the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by having the opportunity to engage 3d prin@@ ters and infin@@ ite computing , and so much more productive than ever before .
so , what can three billion growing , healthy , educ@@ ated , societies , members of the human community bring us ?
how about a sentence of new , no one &apos;s ever vot@@ ed before .
how about being the op@@ pres@@ sed wher@@ ever you are to give up a voice to get yourself out and to make change , for the very first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring with us ?
how about the promis@@ es that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that small teams , who are motiv@@ ated by passion and focus , are able to create extraordinary things , things that could only make big businesses and governments in the past .
i want to close with a story that really gets really excited about me .
there is a program that maybe some people know .
it &apos;s a game called it called the following .
it was developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
and it &apos;s a game where individuals can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to explore how this protein is going to be evol@@ vable .
and at the end of its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the medical science .
and yet , this was a problem for super@@ computers .
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors , and so on .
and there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern recogni@@ tion is better the protein than the best super@@ computer .
and when these individuals came and looked at who became the world &apos;s most radical cre@@ ator in the world , this is not a mit professor student , it was someone from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman whose day , who worked at the age of business in a re@@ hab clin@@ ic , and at night , the world &apos;s small@@ -@@ or@@ an@@ ger was working in the world at night .
ladies and gentle@@ men , which i have great faith in our future , is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put us out of the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to the tools with exponenti@@ al technology .
we &apos;ve got the passion of a di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ators .
we &apos;ve got the capital of tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ pi@@ es .
and we have three billion new parents that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
thank you very much .
i think we need to have something to do with a shif@@ ted piece of medical culture companies .
and i think it begins with a medical medical community , and i think that &apos;s what it is
and maybe i &apos;m in the business for a long time , because i can allow myself to give me a piece of my own favorite pre@@ c@@ ision to make this happen .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why don &apos;t we ?
we &apos;re down the seas@@ on@@ es , and we &apos;re moving forward to the world cham@@ pi@@ on .
we all love baseball , haven &apos;t we ?
and pau@@ lin is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds and hundreds of them .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; appe@@ ars soon , and it turns out to be experts , and to use them to use a great week team .
so i &apos;m going to argue that i &apos;m hop@@ ing most of you have heard about me before .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 , if a bat is 300 .
what this means is that the player is likely to beat three out of 10 stro@@ kes .
that means the ball in the out@@ field , he comes up , he doesn &apos;t catch , and who the ball tries to take to the first base , it wasn &apos;t going to go in time , and it wasn &apos;t safe for safety .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 3@@ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ po@@ und in great lea@@ gue baseball ?
well , really well , maybe a mer@@ ry star .
do you know how you call a 4@@ 00@@ -@@ dig@@ it call ?
this is somebody who is safe at the end of four out of the day .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y , as ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ er -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball player who met over 400 times over a regular seas@@ on-@@ seas@@ on .
let &apos;s trans@@ late back to my world &apos;s world , which i feel about a few stran@@ ger , or maybe a little bit less than i &apos;ve talked to you about this .
so suppose you have a blin@@ d@@ board , and you &apos;re transi@@ zed to an oper@@ ator , which is the average power of 400 in terms of blin@@ d@@ ful am@@ her@@ ies .
it doesn &apos;t really work , right ?
if you think about life in a certain remote area , and you have a belo@@ ved person with s@@ uns@@ he@@ ated heart ves@@ sel@@ s , and your hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds are cros@@ sing this to a car@@ di@@ ologist whose minim@@ um capacity at the average level of oil .
but , do you know what ?
she &apos;s much better this year . she &apos;s on the rise of the stick .
and she &apos;s holding a 25@@ 7 .
and somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you one question .
what do you think the average effect for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , should be a cham@@ pi@@ er , should be a res@@ cu@@ t@@ ant ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what a good surge@@ on or a doctor or res@@ cu@@ es should be .
what we do , though , is that every one of them , i &apos;ve ad@@ ded to be perfect to the world , is to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one will do anything about the details of how this should be done .
and this is the message i took at the medical school .
i was an obs@@ essi@@ ve student , i was an obs@@ essi@@ ve student
in high school , a student said that brian gold@@ man was going to learn for a b@@ old test .
and this is what it was .
and i learned in my little back@@ steps in the nur@@ cher res@@ iden@@ ce at the tor@@ onto general hospital , so far from here .
i learned everything about it .
in my in@@ atom@@ ic lec@@ ture , i learned the orig@@ ins and the dist@@ ant of every mus@@ cles , each bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery of every ar@@ tery of the ar@@ tery of a@@ or@@ ta , ob@@ sc@@ ure and ordinary differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis .
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ g@@ re a@@ ci@@ sh@@ ates .
and all the time i was growing up more and more to know .
and i was good , i went out with c@@ um lau@@ de .
and i left the medical study with the impres@@ sion that i had , if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as possible as possible , as possible as possible as possible , that i was imm@@ une to making mistakes .
and it worked for a long time until i met a woman .
i was resi@@ stant at a teacher hospital here in tor@@ onto as a woman who was brought into the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital in the hospital department .
at that moment , i was given the car@@ di@@ ology layer of the car@@ di@@ matic service .
and it was my mission , when the emergen@@ cy workers sou@@ ght car@@ chan@@ ology , to study the emergen@@ cy patients .
and let &apos;s give feedback to my upp@@ ers .
i studied my wife &apos;s wife , and she was in s@@ uns@@ h@@ ence .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she made her embar@@ ras@@ sing no@@ g@@ g@@ y .
and when i finished her ch@@ est with ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i could hear a ch@@ ame sound on both sides , which told me that she suff@@ ered with a conc@@ ern of her@@ ber heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart fa@@ ils , instead of pump@@ ing all the blood further , put a part of the blood in the lung , and it fre@@ ets a part of the blood , so the shor@@ tation of the skin came up .
and it wasn &apos;t really a difficult thing to do .
and i made her , and i made care of the treatment .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in . i gave her medicine to take the pressure out of the heart .
i gave her medicine , which we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water , so that they get the flu@@ id out .
and over a year and a half to two hours , they started to feel better .
and i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to me with my th@@ est dan@@ gers .
i didn &apos;t take the listen@@ er up and i did what a phone call would have been on my top dan@@ ger to ac@@ qui@@ re it , so that he would have had a chance to make a face .
and he knew , he could have been able to invi@@ te more information to her .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the help of the physi@@ cian .
maybe i really wanted to work so successful and make a responsibility that i was so hand@@ ed , and so i would be able to make a decision for my patients without having to contact it without having to
so my second mistake was worse .
which i sent her home , i mis@@ sion@@ ed a quie@@ tly voice in me , trying to say , &quot; gold@@ man , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it hurt me so much of self-@@ confidence that i asked the nur@@ se , which was asking for the woman to check around , &quot; do you know it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nur@@ se thought about it , and he said , &quot; sure , i think it &apos;ll go out well . &quot;
i remember , like , it was yesterday .
so i sig@@ ned up the de@@ mis@@ ture pad and a tu@@ p@@ pet and i brought them home and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , the night , i had this na@@ sty feeling in my sto@@ mach .
but i was working on it .
and at the end of the day , i grab@@ bed my stuff , and i dro@@ pped the hospital , and i went to par@@ king space to go home with the car , and i did something that i couldn &apos;t do .
i went home from the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
and there , another hospital said , not the sister who saw prin@@ ter prin@@ ter , but another three words , and those three words , most of the emergen@@ cy doctors i know .
other medical profession@@ als are also afraid of it , but the emergen@@ cy care care is particularly , because we see the patients just so stre@@ t@@ ched .
the three words said : remember what ?
&quot; do you remember the patient that she dro@@ pped home for home ? &quot;
then the nur@@ se said .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in that particular note .
so , she was back .
she was back , she was dying .
about one hour after she reach@@ ed home , after leaving her home , she collap@@ sed , and the family called 9@@ 11 , and the spon@@ ch@@ men called them back to the emergen@@ cy department of 50 , which is a dangerous sho@@ ck of 50 , which is a dangerous sho@@ ck .
she har@@ dly brea@@ te , and he was a blue stick .
the emergen@@ cy staf@@ f pulled all the str@@ ands .
they put out their blood pressure .
and she ta@@ pped them up to the machine machine .
i was sho@@ cked , and i was sho@@ cked by the inside .
and i went through this roll@@ er@@ aster , because she came to the inten@@ sive care center , and i hop@@ ed she would get out there .
and after two , three days , she realized that she never was going to wake up again .
she didn &apos;t suff@@ er a dama@@ k@@ able bra@@ pe .
her family was gather@@ ing .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they were brought into that .
the next day they li@@ ved her -- son prin@@ ter , woman , a mother and grandmother .
it &apos;s said that you never forget the names of those extin@@ cts .
and that &apos;s the first time i did this myself .
the next couple of weeks i did , and i got the first time myself , the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame , which is in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not the kind of prof@@ it@@ y@@ man that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy sh@@ ame , if you give a secret of the best friend &apos;s secre@@ cy , even though this one gets on a m@@ ess , and then you get rid of the best friend with it , and you &apos;ve got a terrible discussion , if you arri@@ ve at the end of the end , and you get a terrible discussion , and you feel that you never do it again .
if you &apos;re wrong about re@@ crea@@ tion@@ ation , and you never do it again
this is the kind of acade@@ pi@@ ent sh@@ ame .
the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the ones that make you sick in the front of the first
it &apos;s the one who tells you that it &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done , but you &apos;re bad to it .
and that &apos;s what i felt like .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my zen@@ s ; he was very nice .
he was talking to me with the family , and i &apos;m confi@@ dent that he would h@@ our@@ ish the wo@@ mach , and definitely realized that i wasn &apos;t going to su@@ ck .
but i was constantly embar@@ ras@@ sed to these questions .
why have i not asked the cur@@ ti@@ sts ? why did i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i do such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly , but certainly it took place .
i started feeling better to feel .
and then on a fri@@ ght-@@ day day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds , and the sun came out , and i might tell you maybe i can feel better .
and i said to myself that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ ction , and i never enjo@@ yed a mistake again that the voice could st@@ um@@ ble .
and so she did .
and i continu@@ ed to work .
and then again , it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergen@@ cy center in a commun@@ al hospital north north of tor@@ onto , and i re@@ covered a 25@@ -year-old man with re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation .
it was a lot of time , and i &apos;m in s@@ wal@@ low .
he &apos;s always poin@@ ted here .
i looked in the hall , and it was a little bit of p@@ ink .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him up .
and even as he walked out of the door , he showed him on his ro@@ oth .
two days later , i came to my next emergen@@ cy service , and my tru@@ il@@ er asked me to become a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember you ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the break of paper ? &quot;
and it turned out he &apos;s a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ ene infe@@ ction .
he had a poten@@ tially vi@@ vid disease called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
you can goo@@ gl@@ ish that , but it &apos;s not infe@@ ction of the ra@@ zz , but the top of the pain , and the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation of the tre@@ a@@ ks .
and , lu@@ ck@@ ily , he didn &apos;t die .
he got in@@ tra@@ val@@ ous anti-@@ bo@@ tas@@ tic@@ a , and she re@@ turned a couple of days later .
and i went back through the same quar@@ ters of sh@@ ame and self-@@ dou@@ bt , felt my body and went back to work and went back to work again and again and again .
in an emergen@@ cy number , i &apos;ve had two times a blin@@ d@@ war@@ ge .
there is a lot of this , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital , at that time , 14 patients per night had just a night
and in both cases , i didn &apos;t invi@@ te them home , and there were certainly no dis@@ hes in their treatment .
i thought he was kid@@ ney st@@ ones at one point .
i jo@@ ined the ni@@ cher of the kid@@ ney , and when it was a conc@@ ern , my collea@@ gue , in the re@@ view of the patient , had a gravi@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in the lower right sector , and i called the oper@@ ators .
the other one had a strong di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
i klu@@ i@@ de flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ pl@@ ate him , and i asked my colleagues to look at him .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he mobili@@ zed a ferti@@ li@@ ty at the right lower sector , he called the oper@@ ators .
and they had surgery in both cases , and they were good .
both coun@@ t@@ ings at me , i &apos;m going to ask up .
and i &apos;d be fortun@@ ate to tell you that my worst mistake was only happened in the first five years , which many of my colleagues would say , but total non@@ sense .
i &apos;ve been talking about some of my blocks in the last five years .
and alone , no support , no support .
so , here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about it , if i can talk about the quie@@ t voice that tells me what really happened to me , how can i tell me what &apos;s going to happen to my
how can i teach them my er@@ r@@ ors so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i &apos;m in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think you &apos;re thinking about me .
when did you hear the last time you heard about somebody wrong about mis@@ er@@ ation about failure ?
oh , you &apos;re going to go to a cock@@ tail party , and there you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues with colleagues and trying to ask their immedi@@ ate support and invi@@ te to tell you what i just told you , i would probably not reach the end of the second story before it really would , someone would give you a jo@@ ke , you would change the top@@ ic and forget the rest of it .
and in fact , if i know my colleagues or my colleagues that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c had gone out in my hospital , you &apos;d trust me , i would have trouble look at problems .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely den@@ ial of er@@ r@@ ors .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic posi@@ tions -- the ones that make mistakes and those that are none of the sleep , those who inclu@@ de the sleep of sleep , and the lack of di@@ vor@@ ce , which is with bad results .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological reaction as an anti@@ body that attac@@ ks a human .
and there is the idea that if we put those who make er@@ r@@ ors out of medicine , we &apos;re going to fall out of a safe system
but there are two problems on it .
in my 20@@ -@@ years of medical sen@@ sation of medical sen@@ sation and journ@@ alism , i have a personal medical study on medical er@@ r@@ ors and wrong fun@@ dents to allow me all the time for one of my first artic@@ les that i show for the tor@@ onto star to my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
and what i &apos;ve learned is that mistakes are absolutely ir@@ relevant .
we work in a system where every day mistakes will happen every single day , where a decade of 10 medi@@ cations may be a fal@@ se or a mis@@ sed , where hospital infe@@ ctions will be more and more of pay@@ s and de@@ va@@ station or de@@ va@@ station or dead .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die of re@@ com@@ men@@ ded er@@ r@@ ors .
in the united states , the institute for medicine , the institute for a thousand .
they &apos;re very strong under@@ extin@@ ctions , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the cru@@ x .
in a hospital system where medical scientists have dou@@ bled every two to three years , we can &apos;t deal with .
sleep g@@ arb@@ age is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive er@@ ror , so that we can take a perfect disease on a patient with a breast pain .
and so i take the same patient with the breast pain , and i do it che@@ ating , and i give you a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic breath , and all of a sudden , the story is inter@@ placed with de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing .
i &apos;m not going to take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptom@@ s always in the same way .
all of those are er@@ r@@ able . it &apos;s un@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able
so , if you take the system like this , as i &apos;ve been taught it , and i &apos;ve ad@@ ded all of the failed health students , then no one is left .
and do you know the coura@@ ge about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst ancestors ?
in my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot; i have the ser@@ pon@@ ent to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to each of the support assi@@ stan@@ tors to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about y@@ ours ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show him with the micro@@ phone .
and then their pu@@ p@@ ils exp@@ ands , and they hit their head in front of them , and they look very heavy , and they start telling their stories , they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistakes that i was making . &quot;
what they need is an environment , which it uses it in a position .
what you need is a new culture of medical culture .
and it starts with a physi@@ cian .
the new determin@@ ed doctor is a human , it knows about his humanity , accep@@ ted it , is not proud of mistakes , but gives everything to learn about them so that it can be passed forward .
she &apos;s sharing her experiences with others .
they &apos;re suppor@@ ting if others are talking about their mistakes .
and she shows others whose er@@ r@@ ors , not just to fla@@ p , but in a lo@@ ad@@ ful , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody &apos;s benef@@ iting .
and it works in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes that people fill the system with life , and when it is , people also make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system is designed to create po@@ cu@@ ps that make it easier , which makes it easier , making people un@@ pre@@ cise , and also en@@ ab@@ led to create suppor@@ table spaces where anyone who sees health care , in fact , can actually address things , which can be a potential er@@ ror , can actually be re@@ war@@ ded , and specifically for people like me , making mistakes to be re@@ war@@ ded , and therefore , specifically for people like me , they ought to be
so my name is brian gold@@ man .
i &apos;m the new determin@@ ed physi@@ cian .
i &apos;m a person . i &apos;ll do mistakes .
i mis@@ fortun@@ e , but i &apos;m trying to learn best things about it , and i &apos;ll try to give it to you all the time .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re going to do , but i can live with it .
so , let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
so i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about transforma@@ tional under@@ value .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time .
so the first story is charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
you know , he was in 18@@ 35 here .
you may think he hun@@ ted fin@@ ches , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he colle@@ cted fish .
he described one of them as a very , very usual .
it was a p@@ ack@@ y .
until back to the 198@@ 0s , he was in great style .
and now he &apos;s a dangerous species on the list of treatment .
we heard this story a lot of times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet we &apos;re still going to the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands .
we &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re ini@@ tially .
they &apos;re still described as un@@ tou@@ ched as un@@ tou@@ ched .
what has happened here ?
the second story is going to be a different concept , the change of change , the transforma@@ ctive ta@@ st@@ ness .
because i experienced it when i was studying a la@@ go@@ on in west africa .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought , i can integra@@ te myself .
and i got a bad sun@@ burn , and i felt confi@@ dent that i really wasn &apos;t there from there .
and it was my first sun@@ burn .
and as you can see , the la@@ go@@ on of pal@@ m and some man@@ gro@@ ves were ar@@ ran@@ ged by a pair of man@@ gro@@ ves .
there was about 20 in@@ ches of in@@ ch , black ch@@ at@@ ters , an under@@ f@@ ass of the bun@@ g@@ in .
the fis@@ hes of these cro@@ vor@@ ers were very u@@ pris@@ ed , and the fis@@ her@@ men survi@@ ved in ghana , and the fis@@ her@@ men were very good in ghana .
when i went back 27 years later , the fish was s@@ hr@@ in@@ king up to half of his size .
she &apos;s growing up five in@@ ches .
they were gene@@ tically re@@ vie@@ wed .
it was still fish .
the people still were happy .
and the fish also had the fortun@@ e to be there .
so it didn &apos;t change anything , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my collabor@@ ation at the introdu@@ ction of the tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory of the tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- even at the beginning of the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe provi@@ ded a lot of develop@@ mental projects .
fishing re@@ mot@@ sar@@ ing , which has already started 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this rather ug@@ ly ship is called mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a four .
i went to mit , and we made re@@ ference across the entire southern south ocean , and in particular , in ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started out there .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of our testing were spon@@ g@@ y , other animals that are lin@@ ked with the reason .
most of the fish , the small dots there on the jun@@ k , the che@@ ck@@ le , were coral re@@ ef@@ s fish .
basically , the bottom of the ocean was on de@@ ck , and then it was thro@@ wn back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition continu@@ es very rapi@@ dly .
within a year , you &apos;re going to go through and start with the commercial fish .
the reason is going to be changed . it &apos;s -- in this case -- a tough reason or white cor@@ als will be hand@@ lo@@ aded .
this is a dead tur@@ tles .
they didn &apos;t eat , they thre@@ w them away , because they were dead .
once again , we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t cr@@ un@@ k yet .
and then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of cra@@ cks is wra@@ pped by fis@@ her@@ s every time they go in areas where they never have never been stab@@ bed .
it &apos;s not going to docum@@ ent .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember about it .
we &apos;re going to fit our min@@ d@@ set into the new level of the new level , and we &apos;re not going to call ourselves what &apos;s there .
when you multi@@ p@@ ly it , what happens is what happens .
on the y-@@ axis are some good things : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of its country , the water supply .
and over time , it changes . it changes , because for the people , their actions are all natural .
every generation looking at the images that you see at the very beginning of your conscious life as a standard , and it &apos;s going to cause everything from it .
and the difference is then being stuck as loss .
but they don &apos;t really take the most los@@ sed los@@ ses .
it can be a sequence of change .
and at the end of it , they just want to get rid of the rema@@ in@@ er@@ al rema@@ ins .
and this is exactly what &apos;s pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are no longer as they were .
you might think that the problem is that the problem of people living in gro@@ vation societies , killing animals , and who ended up being aware after a few generations of what they had done .
because obviously a single animal is going to be a very common animal before it &apos;s extin@@ cted .
so , you don &apos;t lose a lot of these animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it doesn &apos;t seem to be a great loss .
and over time , we &apos;re focused on the big animals , and in the ocean , these are the big fish .
they get less rare , because we catch them .
there &apos;s little fish left over time , and we think this is the value .
the question is , why people accept it .
well , because they didn &apos;t know it was a different way .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , con@@ fir@@ m that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to con@@ fir@@ m it , because the evidence , as they present in an ini@@ tial shape , are not as they would like to cla@@ im that the evidence would be
for example , there are an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that the report of a survey of a survey that occur@@ red in this area can &apos;t be used , or by fishing scientists , usually not being treated , or fishing scientists don &apos;t usually , because he is not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have a situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in corpo@@ ated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
and this shows the enor@@ m@@ ously important role that can be played a marine prote@@ cted area .
because through oce@@ an-@@ prote@@ ction areas , we &apos;re basically re-@@ assem@@ bling the past .
we bring back the past that people cannot be able to understand , because the value of value is changing and very low .
so the people who see a marine reser@@ ve , and they &apos;re able to benefit from what they choose to re@@ move their value values .
what about the people who are impossible to do this , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the mi@@ d-@@ west , for example ?
so here , i think the art and the movie may be fil@@ ling the gap , and the simu@@ lations .
this is the character of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
there &apos;s a long time ago , there was e@@ als -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes and the sha@@ p@@ ples don &apos;t remember &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
when you think about &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people were tou@@ ched like this -- except by the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ ist story , why were she so tou@@ ched from the world &apos;s world ?
because it &apos;s a little bit ra@@ ke that &apos;s been lost in some way .
so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , the only one i &apos;m going to give you is c@@ amer@@ on , so he fli@@ ps &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
thanks very much .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in commun@@ ist eastern country , you had to , if you had a writing machine , you had to regi@@ ster those at the government .
and they also had to regi@@ ster a paper with pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions from this writing machine .
and the reason for this : the government was able to track back where a text came from .
if they found an article with fal@@ se thought , they could look at the heart of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west exactly how anybody could do something like this , and how much that freedom was going to collapse .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you buy a new color las@@ er in 2011 today , you &apos;d buy a new color las@@ er from the top las@@ er prin@@ ted and print a page , and then this page has flas@@ hed a flas@@ h of light on every page that can easily follow the page on you and take your prin@@ ter back on it .
this is what happens to us today .
and no one seems to re@@ cover about that .
and this was an example of what our own governments are about the technology against us , the citizens , the people .
and this is one of the three main sources of today &apos;s online problems that we have today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really going on in the world : we can divi@@ de the attac@@ ks into categ@@ ories .
we &apos;ve got three main groups .
and there are online crimin@@ als .
for example , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo from k@@ ie@@ w at u@@ kra@@ ine in the u@@ kra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ tive of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these people deser@@ ve money .
they use online attac@@ ks to ear@@ n a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online milli@@ on@@ ics , multi-@@ milli@@ on@@ aries that have their money through attac@@ ks .
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ mir t@@ sa@@ st@@ a from tar@@ tu in est@@ eland .
and this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
ste@@ phen wat@@ h .
b@@ j@@ he@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q@@ ar da@@ an@@ and and so on and so forth .
these people are online to thri@@ ve , but they &apos;ve made it illegal , by example , using tro@@ j@@ er to cla@@ im money from our bank accoun@@ ts , while we &apos;re doing our online ban@@ king , as we &apos;re doing our online ban@@ king , or also key@@ log@@ gers , who have colle@@ cted our credit card information at the same time , while we buy over an infe@@ cted computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agen@@ cy fro@@ gue two months ago , the s@@ wis@@ s account by mr. sam ja@@ in , and on that account were 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars when it was fro@@ zen .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on free feet , which is un@@ known in the place .
and i &apos;m very much suggest@@ ing that it &apos;s more likely to be vic@@ ti@@ ms of an online com@@ ment than a dis@@ pen@@ r@@ ist in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that it &apos;s still going to become worse .
in the future most of the crime , most of the crime goes on online .
the second largest commercial group that we can obser@@ ve today are not fund@@ ed by money .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- the prote@@ sts of it , or by their audience .
groups like anony@@ mous have gone up over the last 12 months , and they &apos;re one of the main players on the field of the online attac@@ ks .
so , these are the three main ads : crimin@@ als that are doing it for money , fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ists like anony@@ mous , which are caus@@ ing that resi@@ stance , but the last group are nations , governments , governments that are leading the attac@@ ks .
we &apos;re afraid of how ste@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is .
it shows you what happens when governments are attac@@ ked their own citi@@ zen .
nei@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a very powerful cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- warm . it &apos;s it .
last fall , it had to put it in in@@ kla@@ ven@@ ce , because stan@@ in@@ ot@@ ar was ha@@ cked .
somebody was po@@ pped up , and he was ha@@ cked by the system .
and last week , in a meeting with a du@@ tch govern@@ ance , i posed one of those group of these group asking the question whether he had died for possible , that because of the sil@@ in@@ ine ha@@ ck people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die at con@@ sequence of one such ha@@ cks ?
tu@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fied place .
they &apos;re selling cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
what do you do with the cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate ?
now , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate , if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with ss@@ cell@@ op@@ ed services , for example , g@@ mail .
now we all use , or many of us , g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are particularly distribu@@ ted in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents are using foreign ma@@ sters like g@@ mail , because they know that they can trust more confidence than local families , and that they &apos;re en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over silk connections so that the local government can &apos;t s@@ hr@@ ink in their conversation .
but still , if you &apos;re in an out@@ wh@@ el@@ der@@ ly foreign .
cer@@ ti@@ fication char@@ ges ha@@ ck@@ le and dis@@ rup@@ ted cer@@ ti@@ fication .
and this is exactly what tumor@@ in@@ ot@@ ar &apos;s case happened .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening in eg@@ y@@ pt , for example ?
now in eg@@ y@@ pt , the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy in the 18@@ v@@ eil in apri@@ l , 2011 , the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an mammo@@ -@@ police police , and they found a lot of action .
and in those acts , a cre@@ ator was called &quot; the fin@@ fish . &quot;
and in this cre@@ ator , the notes of one in germany had a few programs sold by the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government , which had sold several programs to which they -- in very lar@@ ge-@@ scale terri@@ tory -- were able to capture any communication of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens .
they had this program on the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government program to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
the corpo@@ rate head@@ quar@@ ters is right here .
so western governments provide pris@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with aid tools so that they can take care of their own citizens .
but the western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany a couple of weeks ago , just a couple of weeks ago , he found a tro@@ j@@ er , and it was a tro@@ j@@ er who was used by ger@@ man government services to pun@@ ish her own citizens .
if you &apos;re sus@@ pe@@ cted in an crimin@@ al case , you &apos;re going to pun@@ ch your phone with something like that .
but today , we &apos;re far beyond what we are .
they &apos;re ta@@ pping their internet bon@@ ding .
they use tools like the state stro@@ j@@ er to cast their computer with a tro@@ j@@ er who allows you to monit@@ or all of the communic@@ ations , listen to their online conver@@ sions , to collect their pas@@ ses .
so , if we keep thinking about these things , the obvious answer of people would be saying , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter me , because i &apos;m a bra@@ ck citi@@ zen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it .
i don &apos;t have anything to hi@@ de . &quot;
and that argu@@ ment@@ ation doesn &apos;t make sense .
it has to be priv@@ acy .
priv@@ acy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between priv@@ acy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between liber@@ ty and control .
and as we now today , in 2011 , in the year 2011 , we may be aware of the government that we &apos;re giving away for forever .
and do we know that we &apos;re tru@@ sting one of the future government , a government that we may have in 50 years to have in the 5@@
those are the questions we have to deal with for the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ te she@@ pher@@ l .
the first con@@ cre@@ te stri@@ st@@ les were made in 18@@ 6@@ 8 , and they em@@ bed@@ ded a simple idea : agi@@ le of c@@ ement with exi@@ sting senses that fit together .
con@@ cre@@ te blocks became very rapi@@ dly the emerging public unit area in the world .
it invi@@ tes us to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one block after the other .
basically , the con@@ cre@@ te pla@@ te block was given to the building of our time .
nearly a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out of this .
it was called the auto@@ matically adap@@ ting stone .
and within a couple of years , le@@ go went in every hou@@ se@@ hold .
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion st@@ ones , or 75 stro@@ cks for each person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings .
and le@@ go made it possible for all possible .
so le@@ go basically has a pla@@ te pla@@ te , which is the building block of the world , and made it a blu@@ ial pad for our imagination .
in the mean@@ time , in the case of bell lab@@ s , the next revolution announ@@ ced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would bring us from a world of sta@@ tic , broad@@ band building blocks to a world in which everything was inter@@ active .
as the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows us to build much larger , more complex cir@@ cles , a rock after the other .
but there is a major difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t toler@@ ate this that the building poster of our time is reser@@ ved for the experts , so i decided to change this .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started explor@@ ing this idea of how to make the power of engineers into the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing in le@@ v@@ ance &apos;s its .
so let me show you how it works .
li@@ tt@@ ing@@ its are electr@@ onic mo@@ du@@ le , which have a specific function .
they are pre@@ domin@@ ed , light , sound , engine and sen@@ sor .
and the best part is that it conne@@ cts with magne@@ ts together .
that &apos;s how they can &apos;t get them wrong .
the st@@ ones are the color co@@ ded .
green is out@@ put , blue is current , p@@ ink is input , and orange is c@@ able .
so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green together , and you can build a very rapi@@ dly larger hous@@ ing .
they add a blue to a green green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and so you &apos;ve made a little di@@ mmer .
take the switch out around a pul@@ se of a pul@@ se , which is here , and you &apos;ve made a little blind .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for an extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop this .
it &apos;s actually quite powerful . it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of co@@ ding , wired or dis@@ car@@ ded , li@@ dden life allows you to program them with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so , in order to acceler@@ ate the blind or slow down , you just throw it on the butt@@ on , and it makes the impul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ yle &apos;s its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction around the world into a com@@ modi@@ ty ar@@ ray .
lights , sound , solar elements , mot@@ ors -- all should be available .
we distribu@@ ted li@@ tt@@ ine@@ its to kids , and we see them playing with it .
and it was an un@@ belie@@ vable experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics that you &apos;re going to surro@@ und and which you don &apos;t learn in school .
like for example , working a ni@@ ght@@ light , or why the do@@ ors fall down in the back , or a ipo@@ d is respon@@ ding on touch .
we also brought it to design schools to design schools as well .
so , for example , we had language with no experience in electr@@ onic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ yle &apos;s eyes as a material .
and here we see , with fil@@ r , paper and water bot@@ tles , like george the ...
a couple of weeks ago , we brought li@@ tt@@ ess its to ris@@ d , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just car@@ ton , wood and paper -- and told them , &quot; do what makes it . &quot;
this is an example of a project that they did , a modi@@ fied con@@ cre@@ te can@@ on can@@ on .
but wait , this is really my favorite project , ok ?
it &apos;s a bu@@ mer from pla@@ f , which is fear in the dar@@ k@@ ness .
for those non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ ue &apos;s its material was just one other material , electr@@ on@@ ics became just another material .
and we want to make this material available to all of us .
so , li@@ tt@@ yle its open source is .
you can go on the website , send all the design front lines and make it yourself .
we want to encoura@@ ge the world of the public , the inv@@ ent@@ ors , to encoura@@ ge compassion , because this world that we live in , that inter@@ active world , is present to us .
so , pull out and start inv@@ enting them .
thanks very much .
