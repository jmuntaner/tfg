you know , one of the great reasons when travel@@ ing , and one of the pleas@@ ures at eth@@ no@@ graph@@ ical research is to live with the people that can remember the old days , that their past still feels in the wind , tou@@ ching them on the rain@@ ro@@ w rock , touch them in the woo@@ den leaves of the plants .
just the know that ja@@ gu@@ ar sh@@ am@@ an@@ es travel beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the meaning of the my@@ ths of the ol@@ dest of the on@@ est of in@@ u@@ it still , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as the budd@@ hi@@ sts still follow the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , that is the idea that the world in which we live , is not in a completely true sense , but only as a model of reality , as a con@@ sequence of a group of certain possibilities of adap@@ tation that we see , is very success@@ fully success@@ fully cho@@ sen many generations ago , starting to success@@ fully cho@@ se many generations
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ t@@ ability .
we all lie . we bring children to the world .
we run through the initi@@ ation ritu@@ als .
we have to move through the un@@ stopp@@ able separ@@ ation through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique co@@ inci@@ dence of the song , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s about the pen@@ an in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ st@@ in in haiti , or the war@@ ri@@ or in the ka@@ is@@ u@@ ge desert from nor@@ gh@@ ia , the cur@@ ander@@ os in the sahar@@ a . this is the collea@@ gue i &apos;m travel@@ ing with a month ago , or even a y@@ i she@@ pher@@ d in the middle of the sahar@@ a . or even a y@@ n@@ i she@@ pher@@ d on the &apos; q@@ et@@ ab@@ berg slo@@ und , ever@@ est , the god go@@ d@@ mother in the world .
all these people taught us that there are other people who are facing opportunity , other ways of thinking , other ways to ori@@ ent on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can pur@@ s@@ ist you only with hope .
together , the multi@@ grown cultures of the world is forming a network of spi@@ ritual and cultural life that is also thro@@ wing the earth and is also as important for the earth , like the biological life of life that &apos;s known as a bio@@ sphere .
you can think of this cultural life network as an eth@@ no@@ sphere : eth@@ o@@ sphere can tran@@ sc@@ end the vast sum of thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths and intui@@ tions that have been produced by the human imagination since the early beginn@@ ings of conscious mind are defined
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what to be stri@@ ctly cher@@ aci@@ ous species .
and just as the bio@@ sphere was strong , this was done with the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- only with even bigger speed .
no bi@@ mes would say car , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are almost before the extin@@ ction , because it &apos;s just not right . and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ um in the field of biology -- is almost equivalent to what we know as optimi@@ stic about the most up@@ sc@@ u@@ red of the cultural diversity .
and the cru@@ cial indi@@ c@@ ator is the extin@@ ction of languages .
as any of you were born in this room , she was spo@@ ken on the earth 6@@ ,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the whole vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary of vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r .
a language is appe@@ ar@@ an@@ ced of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means that the sou@@ l of a particular culture can find access to the material world .
each language is like an ancient forest of the mind , an el@@ ev@@ ation point , an idea , an ecosystem of spi@@ ritual possibilities .
and of these 6@@ ,000 languages today , while we sit in mon@@ ter@@ ey here , we don &apos;t elimin@@ ate half up in the e@@ ars of children .
they don &apos;t teach kids any more . that means , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what might be more lon@@ ely than being surro@@ unded by the sil@@ ence , one of the people &apos;s last being to talk to your language , no possibility to continue the wisdom of ancestors , or to expect the hope ?
yet this terrible dest@@ in@@ y actually pul@@ ls anyone on the earth , about every two weeks , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies , and takes the last p@@ ar of an old language to the gra@@ ve .
and i know some of you may say , &quot; well , isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world not a better place , if we all would talk a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be the language of chil@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s be kan@@ mon@@ es@@ ian .
let them be kog@@ i . &quot;
and then you suddenly realized what it would be like if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so today , i want to kind of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a quick journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to understand to you what actually went wrong .
well , there are some am@@ on@@ gst us that i &apos;m sure that , in a sense , i say , &quot; various possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities of his being .
take for example this child of the bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west , the people of an@@ a@@ kon@@ da , they believe that they came up with my@@ th@@ ological the mil@@ ky flow of the east from the east , in the bel@@ ly of hol@@ y sna@@ kes .
this is a people that doesn &apos;t cogni@@ tively live between the colors of blue and green , because the sky is the eleph@@ ant of the forest that people dep@@ end on .
they have a strange language and a well-@@ law pres@@ cri@@ ption called l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : you have to mar@@ ry somebody who spea@@ ks to a different language .
all of this ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , which is a strange part of these big houses , where the mis@@ nom@@ ers are spo@@ ken six or seven languages , but that you &apos;ll never listen to somebody who lear@@ ns a language .
they just listen to and they start to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i in ecu@@ gu@@ or , an amazing people who had been cont@@ fac@@ ed in 16@@ 8 expres@@ sed in 195@@ 8 .
in 195@@ 7 , five arr@@ sion@@ ary contact tried to take five mis@@ sion@@ ary contact .
they were fil@@ ling out sh@@ in@@ y photographs of ou@@ ts , which we would ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate as a friend@@ ly gest@@ ure , and they for@@ got that these people from the rain@@ forest in their lives had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and conclu@@ ded that this business diagra@@ m was of de@@ vil , and they killed the five reci@@ ver@@ s with spe@@ er .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i did not just killed the out@@ come with the spe@@ ers .
they were trans@@ fer@@ ring each other .
fif@@ ty percent of the dea@@ ths was ab@@ used by ab@@ dri@@ p@@ ts .
we lin@@ ed back the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations , and found two cases of a natural death , and when we ex@@ posed people to conclu@@ de about it , they gave that one of the people was so old that he died because of his aging , and we still killed him with spe@@ er .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest , which was quite amazing .
their h@@ unter could smell the ur@@ in@@ ine of an animal from 40 steps away and im@@ pos@@ ing what the animal species ow@@ ned .
in the early 8@@ 0s , i got a really incredible task when my profess@@ or professor asked me to go to haiti , if i was interested in to in@@ fil@@ tra@@ te to haiti and to in@@ fil@@ tra@@ te the secret societies , which were the bedro@@ ck of the strength of du@@ v@@ ali@@ ans and clay ma@@ cou@@ ts and the po@@ ison that was used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
now to give you a sense of sense , i had to , of course , have to give a sense about this remarkable faith of vo@@ zz@@ is and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a culture of black magic and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o .
in the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical view .
it &apos;s thri@@ ll@@ ing .
if i were to ask you to guess the great world subje@@ cts , what would you say ?
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
a continent is always ab@@ and@@ oned , because the assu@@ mption was that there was no religious faith in black africa , of course , there was no religious faith , and of course , there was one and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o was simply this very profound religious idea that was coming through the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very .
but what vo@@ o@@ do@@ o does so interesting is this vi@@ tal relationship between the living and the dead .
the living sons are the ambi@@ dom@@ s .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be tex@@ ted by the big water , answers to the rhyth@@ m of dance to over@@ come the sou@@ l of the living forward , so that the ac@@ oly@@ th is going to be a short sh@@ ining moment to god .
and grand@@ born li@@ kes to say vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists , &quot; your white wal@@ ks to church and talk about god .
we dance in temp@@ le , and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re going to take off of the mind . how can you be used by har@@ m ?
look at this amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ th in a trans@@ cen@@ tion , the glo@@ wing coal with no su@@ ite , an amazing illu@@ stration of the sense of the mind to influ@@ ure the body to make the body that this is keeping when it &apos;s written into a state of extreme ar@@ ou@@ sal .
now , of all the people that i met were the kog@@ i from the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia , the most extraordinary .
off@@ spring the old ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ cal civilization , who popul@@ ated the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in , and in con@@ fer@@ su@@ s , this population fell back to an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ v that dro@@ ps up above the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an of the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an pla@@ an .
in a blood wor@@ ker continent , these people who were never con@@ fron@@ ted by the sp@@ ani@@ ards were ar@@ med .
right to this day , they &apos;re gover@@ ned by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od . the education of pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is very extraordinary .
young ac@@ oly@@ es are separ@@ ated by their families at age three and four years , and in a sha@@ bot@@ y world of pain@@ t@@ ness , in stone hu@@ ts , for 18 years , gradu@@ ally ele@@ cted to the gl@@ aci@@ er for 18 years . two times from whatever nine years , inten@@ ded to mi@@ mic the nine months of preg@@ nan@@ cy that they spent in their daily mother , now are now me@@ tam@@ or@@ ph@@ or@@ ic in the la@@ p of the big mother
and throughout this whole period , they &apos;re cul@@ tur@@ ally add@@ res@@ sing into the values of their society , values that keeping the cla@@ ims that their pra@@ yers and only their pra@@ yers , the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we could say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- main@@ tain@@ ing balance .
at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , you suddenly have , one day , and for the first time in your life , at 18 years old , you see a sun@@ rise . and in this cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to fli@@ p on the ed@@ ges of amazing cool landscape , suddenly everything that you learned in abstra@@ ct , and the pre@@ a@@ cher comes back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really , like i &apos;ve told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and they say that we &apos;re the yo@@ unger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think of in the landscape and landscape , we &apos;re either cele@@ ma@@ ting r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old sk@@ ill of the no@@ ble wil@@ d , which is a ra@@ ci@@ ful thought , or other th@@ ore@@ au and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , in dom@@ esti@@ c language , they &apos;re not sen@@ ti@@ mental , they &apos;re not car@@ ried by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
it sta@@ ys not too much in the pool of the pool of as@@ m@@ at or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they still , through time and ritual , is sha@@ ped a myster@@ y ni@@ m@@ bur@@ bus of the earth , who is not on the idea of being consci@@ ously close , but on a far more sub@@ tle intui@@ tive , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s dra@@ wn into the human awareness .
now , what does this mean ?
it means that a tiny child is growing out of the top that are growing in the belief that the mountain is an a@@ pu@@ a spirit , that &apos;s going to be a very different person , and a different relationship with this resource or a different relationship with this resource or this place , as a little child from mon@@ tan@@ a that can grow in the belief that a mountain can be a bunch of st@@ ones that can get sor@@ shi@@ ged .
whether it &apos;s a place of a mind or a bunch of er@@ r@@ ance , is ir@@ relevant .
now , what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of british col@@ oni@@ ans , and believe that these fore@@ sts are there to be sc@@ ared .
that led me to another than my friends under the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ t@@ l who believe that these fore@@ sts in the hu@@ be of hu@@ ku@@ k and the trage@@ red cele@@ bri@@ ty and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ic viol@@ ist are who in the nor@@ di@@ de of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts that they would join on their ha@@ par@@ sa@@ to jun@@ ting .
well , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of your extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies , for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a picture that i only took last apri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , that many of you have heard , the stron@@ gest neu@@ social post@@ po@@ de from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of the sh@@ ame .
what ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca does so fascinating is not just the pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical matter of this pre@@ par@@ sor , but his process@@ ing . it &apos;s made really made from two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this woo@@ den li@@ an@@ e that &apos;s a series of bu@@ ta@@ at@@ ines , har@@ m@@ in , har@@ mo@@ lin , little hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ es , s@@ uns@@ h@@ . this cli@@ mber plant is equivalent to her consciousness , but it &apos;s similar to taking a blue plant on smo@@ ke , but it &apos;s also mix@@ ed with the leaves of a switch from the coffee plant with the &quot; psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is . &quot; but
this is a plant that has some very strong tr@@ yp@@ cop@@ es that are very similar to the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ ony@@ y@@ tr@@ yp@@ ine 5 and flexi@@ z@@ y@@ di@@ o yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in .
if you even saw the y@@ an@@ o@@ po@@ i , how they make this stuff gra@@ ve , this sub@@ stance that they also created from various species , they also have a metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ mic mur@@ abo@@ yp@@ tam@@ in .
so , the po@@ w@@ der to fra@@ gi@@ le is about as much as min@@ ed out of a bar@@ p , ban@@ kli@@ gh@@ ted by b@@ aro@@ que &apos;s pain@@ t@@ ings and the land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not produced a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but it &apos;s the resol@@ ution of reality .
i actually talked to my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ d , the man who introduced the trau@@ che@@ deli@@ an cap@@ re@@ a to adop@@ ted the ma@@ gical mush@@ rooms in mexico in the &apos; 3@@ 0s , and i argu@@ ed that you could not inclu@@ de these tr@@ yp@@ rus as hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen , because , in the moment that you feel like you could feel the impact , you &apos;re no longer there to learn a hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
but the thing about s@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is that they can &apos;t be wrong , because it will be mod@@ el@@ ed by one of the human her@@ it@@ age in the human condition , of mon@@ o@@ am@@ in o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase .
they can only be atta@@ ched to some other chemicals that can counter@@ f@@ are the ma@@ o .
now , the amazing thing is that the po@@ ta@@ vor@@ es that are inclu@@ ded in the li@@ an@@ e , ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ators of exactly the same species that &apos;s necessary to affect the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . ask themselves .
how can these people from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ oles@@ cent plants find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally related plants that , if appropri@@ ated this way , create some bio@@ chemical version , so that when they &apos;re combin@@ ed , all kinds of bio@@ chemical version is so bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , try and wrong , what turns out to be meaning@@ less .
but if you ask the indi@@ ans , they said , &quot; the plants are talking to us .
so , what does this mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 vari@@ ations of the month a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , that all of you notice at a very high distance in the forest that look like a species .
and then they asked them how they &apos;re doing their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something of plants .
i mean you don &apos;t know anything at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so it turns out you take each of the 17 vari@@ ations on full moon , and you &apos;re sing@@ ing to you in a different section .
now , this doesn &apos;t get you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count tri@@ ina .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sym@@ pathy for the difficult position of indi@@ ans , they look like an or@@ g@@ ini@@ ally and color@@ ful , but they kind of nar@@ row on the past , while the real world , that &apos;s our world , they continue .
so the fact is , for the 20th century , in 300 years , it &apos;s not for its war or technologi@@ cal innovation , but rather than an era where we were against , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on the earth either are ac@@ tively fund@@ ed or passi@@ ve , so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have involved and over again at the dance with new living .
and the problem is not the technology in itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans never listen to si@@ ou@@ x much less on si@@ ou@@ x when they &apos;re honest and ar@@ row when the americans stopped to be americans , when they &apos;re horse and hor@@ ses of horse .
not change and technology thre@@ ats the integri@@ ty of eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . it &apos;s the ug@@ ly face of the g@@ ad@@ ge@@ um .
and wher@@ ever you look in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not direc@@ ted at the heart . these are dynam@@ ically living people whose existence is being auth@@ ori@@ zed by adap@@ table forces , a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , a no@@ ma@@ di@@ c people from the pen@@ an , and now now to bas@@ alt and pro@@ stit@@ ution at the river floor , from where you can see that even the river is pollu@@ ted with the mu@@ d , who seems to res@@ ha@@ pe nearly hal@@ f-@@ bor@@ ny and pro@@ stit@@ ution at the river floor , where the japanese issues are ready to fill their ships with ra@@ w trees that they have lost the forest , or the y@@ an@@ o@@ dor@@ i , where they &apos;re predat@@ ors to fill their walls with ra@@ w trees that they have dro@@ pped the forest , or the fall of the y@@ an@@ o@@ dor@@ i , where they &apos;re predat@@ ors that are gel@@ ed during the
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i recently study a lot , you &apos;re going to see the ug@@ ly face of the political domin@@ ance .
you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of people is universal , but the eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of the lives of humans , is not only not only con@@ vi@@ cted , but in general and in many in@@ land as part of a develop@@ mental strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering that suffering , if you don &apos;t experience it on the top level .
i travel@@ ed with a young collea@@ gue of 6@@ francisco in western china , covered across sou@@ the@@ tal ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a , and only when i saw je@@ hat@@ a came to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind the statistics of whom you hear . 6@@ ,000 hol@@ y mon@@ u@@ ents , which were killed in the ru@@ d@@ der and as@@ hes . 1.@@ 2 million people that were killed by the c@@ attle .
the father of this young man was identi@@ fied as the follo@@ wers of the animal lam@@ a .
that meant that he had been killed while the chinese invasi@@ on was killed .
his un@@ cle was@@ h with her hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , who brought people to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was lo@@ cked in , as pun@@ ish@@ ment for -- to be weal@@ thy for the crime .
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ ged in prison for two years , to hi@@ de under her rock ran@@ row , because she couldn &apos;t live without life .
the nur@@ se who were commit@@ ted this bra@@ ve exercise was brought into an edu@@ cational camp .
she did take away one day on a wri@@ t band of ma@@ os , and for seven years she had to go to a sever@@ e labor camp for seven years .
the suffering can be in@@ toler@@ able , but the em@@ power@@ ing spirit of people is a little un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
and in the end , we really are in front of a choice . do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ y said before she died that it was her greatest fear that as we moved in toward a thre@@ ad , per@@ si@@ sted , gener@@ ic world@@ view , we would re@@ duced not just the over@@ range of human imagination in a ti@@ ed way , but that we were wa@@ king out of a dream , and for@@ gotten that there was no possibility of others .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species may have exi@@ sted for 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution , which brought us agriculture , and at this moment the cul@@ t of the hall of the hall , which led to the sha@@ man through the pri@@ es@@ man of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od and hier@@ arch@@ y , speci@@ alization and over@@ -@@ pay@@ ment -- just found 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is har@@ dly 300 years old .
now , this super@@ ficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all answers to the challenges that we face in the mil@@ len@@ nia .
if we ask this low-@@ conflict world culture for the meaning of human beings , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : people with ex@@ ternal consciousness that recogni@@ zes the importance that all people and gar@@ dens have to be rel@@ ated to us , and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands , when i went to in@@ u@@ it h@@ unt , and this man , ol@@ ay@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ adi@@ an government is not always very well transpor@@ ted with the in@@ u@@ it , and in the &apos; 50@@ 0s at the san -@@ year develop@@ ment of our return , they were forced to pull in in sett@@ le@@ ments .
the grand@@ father of this old man re@@ f@@ used .
the family that had sc@@ ared about his life , took all the g@@ uns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the in@@ u@@ it didn &apos;t have fear of the cold , they used it to their advantage .
the contr@@ es of their re@@ tail were origin@@ ally made out of fish that were wra@@ pped in car@@ ke skin .
the grand@@ father &apos;s grand@@ father didn &apos;t fear the arc@@ tic night or the land@@ ing stor@@ m .
he &apos;d zi@@ p out , he would pull his pants from the sea du@@ ck fuel and de@@ fe@@ ated in his hand , and when the fe@@ ces started free@@ zing , he formed them in the form of a kni@@ fe .
he put pan@@ els on the sides of the fe@@ ed kni@@ fe , and when it was completely fro@@ zen , he was ama@@ zed a dog with it .
he put the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a sha@@ ke , took the skelet@@ on of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a sle@@ t@@ led , tor@@ tured another dog , and de@@ v@@ ise over the ice ch@@ al@@ ches with the gy@@ et kni@@ fe on the horse b@@ elt .
that &apos;s where you can do something out of nothing .
and this is a symbol of many ways of the resi@@ stance of the in@@ u@@ it and of all the dom@@ esti@@ cated in the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government rele@@ ased the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l in apri@@ l 199@@ 9 , 199@@ 9 left back over an area that is larger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new home@@ land and says n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ak@@ er .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control the miner@@ als .
an ast@@ on@@ ishing example , like a nation , a state , that can look at its own resi@@ dents and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve gone to these dist@@ ant goals of the earth to realize that they &apos;re not going to be at all .
you &apos;re the wel@@ f@@ are countries of somebody .
they represent parts of human imagination that &apos;s coming back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children will be part of our own children of the geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope .
what we &apos;ve done at geographic geographic is that we think politicians are never reach@@ ing anything .
we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we think po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs is not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we think story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best institution for story@@ telling in the world , and our website hands 35 million other minds every month . so our website are 35 million stories every month .
15@@ 6 nations then send our tv chan@@ nel .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions of months .
and we are doing a series of travel into the eth@@ no@@ sphere that we &apos;re taking our audience to places of these cultural belie@@ fs that they suff@@ er from the familiar fl@@ es@@ h , and hopefully , they &apos;re going to assu@@ me one after the other central res@@ on@@ ation of anthropo@@ log@@ y : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in different ways that we can a li@@ ability in a really mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural plu@@ ori@@ alist world , in which the wisdom of all people can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
thank you very much .
what i &apos;m first going to show you , first as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we have left microsoft as part of a transition ago , which is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either address local or faster with a large amount of visual data .
we see lots , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photographs here that you can se@@ am@@ less@@ ly , progress , start to re@@ ar@@ range , in any way , to re-@@ ar@@ ran@@ ged .
and it &apos;s no matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , we &apos;re looking at how large these colle@@ ctions are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital pictures of the camera , but this one , for example , here is a map of the library library , and it &apos;s in a valley of 300 to@@ g@@ ap@@ i .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that can nar@@ row the performance of a system like this is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen in every moment , and it also has a very flexi@@ ble architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-@@ recor@@ ds data .
this is b@@ lea@@ k house of di@@ ck@@ ens . every sp@@ ill@@ ar is a chap@@ ter .
to prove that it really really is about a text and not about an image , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the tex@@ ts and not the picture .
maybe this is an arti@@ stic way to read an e-@@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is a copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
every big picture is the beginn@@ ings of a sequence .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real pa@@ tho@@ form or a newspaper , which is in a kind of a partner@@ ship with several orders of scale .
we also did something at the corner of this particular copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
we have a wrong hin@@ t with very high resol@@ ution designed that &apos;s much higher than a normal ad , and we have ad@@ ded addi@@ tional content .
if you want to see the fun@@ ctions of this car , you can see you here .
or other models , or even technical explan@@ ations .
and this really meas@@ ures these ideas to ero@@ de these restri@@ ctions for the available place on the screen .
we hope that no po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other non@@ sense is more -- it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t really want to spend a lot of time not to say that we &apos;re going to be contribu@@ ting to this area .
but these are all the streets in the united of states .
over@@ bor@@ row up the top picture of nasa &apos;s mel@@ d-@@ flight picture .
let &apos;s take something else out .
this is even live on the internet now . they can te@@ ver@@ t it .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really conne@@ cts two different technologies .
the other is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , from no@@ ah pin@@ net , a university student in washington , under steve l@@ tz at u@@ v coun@@ cil at u@@ v .
and ri@@ ck s@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i of microsoft research has been done . a very good collaboration .
so , this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you can see this , if we create these kind of insi@@ ghts where we can break through images and make this experience of a lot of great ag@@ ents .
but the space graphi@@ cs of the images is actually important here .
the computer visi@@ on algorith@@ ms have cap@@ tured these pictures so they held the real space , where these images that were all made near the gras@@ s@@ i pi@@ cks in the can@@ adi@@ an rock , and you can see elements of soli@@ d sli@@ des or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic image process@@ ing , and these things were syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing differently in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are those who are much more stable .
i &apos;d like to just share one of the original data sets of no@@ ah , and that &apos;s from a early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we &apos;ve been working for the first time in summer to show you what i believe is really the poin@@ ted behind this technology , of photo@@ syn@@ thetic technology , and that &apos;s not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about law@@ yers , because of the law@@ yers .
this is a ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral re@@ construction of ca@@ the@@ dr@@ ot@@ re d@@ ame , who was just condu@@ cting in the computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r . just give them my@@ re d@@ ame in fli@@ ck@@ r and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-@@ shir@@ ts and in the university site , and each of these orange c@@ ameras represent a picture that has been discovered in this model .
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ p images , and they &apos;re all places that are related to each other .
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to end up working with microsoft .
i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for the re@@ com@@ men@@ dation here .
so i sus@@ pe@@ ct you can see that there are many different kinds of c@@ ameras : everything is everything from the mobile si@@ d to professional sl@@ ress , a pretty large number of them that have been wir@@ ed up in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird curi@@ es .
many of them are covered by faces and and so forth .
so somewhere here are a number of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by not@@ re d@@ ame , which was right up right .
we can navi@@ gate from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can make things with social environments , it &apos;s all colle@@ cted data from all of all -- from the whole collective memory of how , visu@@ ally the earth looks -- and everything is connected .
all these photographs are lin@@ ked together , and there are something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that gener@@ ates from all over the earth .
consider this as the sequ@@ el of the work of ste@@ wart law@@ l@@ ers on virtual earth .
and this is something that is using the complexity that people use , and whose use to grow and their use for the user and the actions is going to grow bigger .
your own photos are chur@@ ned with a meta@@ data that has given a different person .
if someone has done the wisdom , and all these sac@@ ches , and shared all of you , my photo comes from the not@@ re ber@@ t ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral suddenly wra@@ pped with all this data , and i can use it as a starting point to bridge in this space , into these metal ver@@ ses , and so to use it as a kind of cros@@ s-@@ discipl@@ ined model of social experience , and therefore a kind of cros@@ s-@@ trans@@ fer model with other families .
and of course , th@@ ie@@ p products are all the huge virtual virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that have been recei@@ ved not just by over@@ stre@@ t@@ ched or satelli@@ te images and so forth by collective memory .
thank you very much .
. so do i understand them ? their software allows that , at some point in the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world are fundament@@ ally mes@@ h-@@ lin@@ ked ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t do anything else than dete@@ cted .
if you want to create them hyper@@ links between the images .
and it &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting , if you think about the loss of the se@@ man@@ tic information that many of these pictures have .
what if you take a web search for images , where you give up sent@@ ences , and the text of the website con@@ tains many information about what &apos;s on this image .
but what if the picture conne@@ cts it with all of your images ?
then the range of se@@ man@@ tic string com@@ pounds and the l@@ ength that makes it out is really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . heart toler@@ ation .
thank you very much indeed .
so i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book that , i hope , are in mind with other things that you &apos;ve been hearing already , and i &apos;m going to try to do even some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i want to start by calling what i call &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
what ? the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the offi@@ cial belie@@ ver of all western industri@@ alized societies .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma works like this : if our obje@@ ctive is ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the social matter of our citizens , this is especially due to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing freedom of individuals .
the reason that freedom is good in itself is value , wor@@ th@@ ful , a na@@ tive desire for the human .
when people have freedom , all of us will be for themselves to do the things that ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our societies , and no one has any to decide for us .
the journey to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more they have better good .
this is , i think , so deeply de@@ plo@@ yed in our water supply , that it would not come in the sense of asking it .
and it &apos;s also been ro@@ ot@@ ed deeply in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you a few examples of what en@@ ables us of modern progress .
this is my super@@ market . it &apos;s not a big one .
i just want to brie@@ fly say a little bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
there are 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ ses in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different photo@@ o@@ val@@ op@@ ies , and 12 bal@@ al@@ i@@ os spent 12 bal@@ al@@ i@@ o rich@@ ly that you could buy to a big number of your own sal@@ at of des@@ s@@ ends , in the un@@ likely case that none of the 17@@ 5 in the store is right for them .
so this is , you know , the super@@ market .
and then they go to the consumption electr@@ on@@ ics business to tell a stere@@ o system -- lou@@ d@@ speak@@ , , c@@ d player , a c@@ asse@@ tte player , radio , am@@ pli@@ fi@@ er , and in this one electr@@ on@@ ics business there are so many stere@@ o buildings .
we can assem@@ ble 6@@ .@@ 5 million different stere@@ o fun@@ ds out of the components that are off@@ ered in this one business .
you have to ad@@ mit that that &apos;s a big sele@@ ction .
in other real@@ ms -- the world of communic@@ ations .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have every phone provi@@ der that you wanted , as long as it came from fashion sla@@ very .
they r@@ ented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . sun bought it .
one ep@@ iso@@ de of that was that the tele@@ phone was never flat .
so these days are over .
we have now almost an infin@@ ite sele@@ ction of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile mobile phones in the future .
my favorite is that in the middle -- mp@@ 3 play@@ ful , earth@@ -@@ ha@@ ir@@ tri@@ cles and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ att@@ e and cr@@ è@@ me &apos;s figu@@ kel .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that yet in your business , you can be sure that you will soon be able to do it .
and what it does is it brings people to run into the business and ask this question .
now , do you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell@@ phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspe@@ cts of life that are much more significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is capable of the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that the doctor go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , we could do a thing or we could do b .
a has these advan@@ tages and some risks .
b has these pre@@ c@@ ision and risks . what do you want to do ?
and you say , &quot; doctor , what do you want me to do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a lam@@ c has these advan@@ tages and risk and b have these advan@@ tages and risk .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , can@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &quot; autonom@@ y . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift of the bur@@ den of the responsibility of somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and the ulti@@ mate probably , and that &apos;s why not in the best const@@ it@@ ution is a decision -- nam@@ ely the patient .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption medi@@ cin@@ es for people like you and me , which if they think about it , they don &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do we ga@@ ther care about ourselves if we can &apos;t buy it ?
the answer is : they expect to call us the doctor the next morning and ask a change in the pres@@ cri@@ ption .
something so profound as our identity now is to a choice of choice of how this slide should show .
we don &apos;t preser@@ ve identity , we inv@@ ent them .
and we need to inv@@ ent as often new how we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up in the morning , you have to choose what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of e@@ ternal and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everybody had one , and they could get married as quickly as they could , and then kids got as fast as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who , not when , and not what they did after after@@ wards .
today , everything is quite easy to have .
i teach wonderful smart students , and i give you 20 percent less work than i used to .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less care@@ ful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re bus@@ y with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i mar@@ ry or not ? should i be as@@ sum@@ ing now ?
should i get married later ? should i have children , or do i even make career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all invi@@ ta@@ tion@@ ally questi@@ oned questions
and you &apos;ll hear these questions matter whether it means all the tas@@ ks that i in@@ tend to get and don &apos;t get good details in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to ans@@ wer@@ ing questions .
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed , like car@@ l illu@@ str@@ ates , with the material that en@@ ables us to work every minute from every day on the planet -- except to the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
, by the way , there &apos;s a corner , i &apos;m going to not tell you about that in which the wir@@ eless work works .
i won &apos;t tell you because i want to use it , because i can use it .
so what it means is that this tremendous freedom of opportunity we have to make decisions in terms of work , again and again , maybe again , whether we should work or not
we can look at our kids at soc@@ cer , and we have our cell phones on the one a hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on other hi@@ p , and our laptop will probably on our la@@ p .
and even if you &apos;re all kno@@ cked , every minute in which we look at our kids in the mu@@ ti@@ lation of a soc@@ cer game , we also ask , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this e-@@ mail ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and also , if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be very different from your child &apos;s foot@@ ball game than it would have been .
anywhere we &apos;re seeing , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all of it was a question of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re living on now looks like this .
and the question is , is the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m about to talk about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on human beings .
so one of the consequences , parado@@ x@@ ical way , is that it &apos;s paraly@@ zing paraly@@ z@@ ess .
with so many op@@ tions that you can choose from , it &apos;s very difficult to decide to be able to
i &apos;m going to give you another dra@@ stic example of , a study on invest@@ ing in volunte@@ er reti@@ re@@ ment .
a collea@@ gue of mine had access to investment docum@@ ents of van@@ gu@@ ard , the giant f@@ on@@ es of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found per 10 investment fund that was the emplo@@ yer , took the participa@@ tion by two percent .
they offer 50 investment to -- 10 percent less employees do -- 10 percent less employees than if they were just off@@ ered five . why ?
because there are 50 investment fund that are the deci@@ ction , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to choose to sho@@ ot it to tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow morning , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come .
understand that it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food when they go in reti@@ re@@ ment , because they don &apos;t have enough money to get back , it means making decisions so hard that they miss great investment supp@@ lies of emplo@@ yer .
through that non-@@ participa@@ tion , it puts them up to 5,000 u.s. a year on the work@@ student who would have been happy to re@@ produce their contribu@@ tion .
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of too many choices .
and i think it &apos;s worried that the world is this like this .
they want to be really useful the decision when it &apos;s for all the e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong app@@ le@@ ments , or even the fal@@ ck sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we get over the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end less content with the out@@ comes of choice than if we &apos;ve had the possibility to decide ourselves between less possibilities .
and there are a couple of reasons for this .
one of them is con@@ fin@@ ed by the great plan@@ ging of different sal@@ at@@ d@@ ings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing is already perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made another decision that would have been better . and what happens is this amazing idea leads to the satis@@ fac@@ tion , and this re@@ gre@@ ts seems negative to the satis@@ fac@@ tion that they had of their gest@@ ed choice even when it was a good decision .
the more possibility there is , the easier is to ad@@ vo@@ cate at all , that &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting to the choices that you meet .
secon@@ dly , what econom@@ ists call op@@ per@@ on cost .
dan gil@@ bert made a big point of morning this morning by telling how much the world we &apos;re foc@@ using on things , depen@@ ding on what we contr@@ ast it .
well , when there are many alterna@@ tives to consider , it &apos;s simply attra@@ ctive to imagine attra@@ ctive tra@@ its of alterna@@ tives that you end up with , it makes you less satis@@ fied with the alterna@@ tives that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what you would have thought .
so here &apos;s a couple at the ham@@ p@@ tons .
very expensive real e@@ state .
beautiful beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; fu@@ ck &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it could be aug@@ ust .
everyone in my web distri@@ ct is gone .
i could par@@ ly park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spent two weeks of the thoughts that he pres@@ sed the possibility , day over day , a great par@@ king lot .
op@@ per@@ on cost is growing the happiness that we have by our sele@@ ction , even when what we cho@@ se is fantastic .
and the more possibility there is to sele@@ ction , the more attra@@ ctive properties of these sele@@ ction are consi@@ stent in the op@@ per@@ on cost .
now , here &apos;s another example .
now , this carto@@ on is doing some stat@@ ement .
he &apos;s doing a stat@@ ement about living now in now and maybe doing things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is : always who you choose for a thing , they don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attra@@ ctive characteri@@ stics have , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less .
three , em@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
this was what happened to me when i wanted to exchange my je@@ ans .
i &apos;m wearing je@@ ans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only je@@ ans of a kind , and they bought her , and they made it bad , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wor@@ n them long enough and they &apos;d often was@@ hed enough , they have started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
so , i went to buy new je@@ ans after a lot of years of com@@ ment , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the counter man said , &quot; would you like to take a bag , a ligh@@ ter or contr@@ ary ?
do you want to was@@ h butt@@ ons or ti@@ l@@ sy ? row or ac@@ id was@@ h ?
do you want to be je@@ ans with holes ?
you want to cut far on the bottom , ke@@ et , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; and so on he said .
my ja@@ w was down , and after i got married , i said , &quot; i would like to have the kind of species that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what it was , so i spent an hour so that all this dam@@ n je@@ ans , and lay the business -- and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- with the best run je@@ ans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had it better . all this anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ent led me to do better .
but i was more bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try it myself to my own .
the reason that i felt bad with all of these available possibilities , my expec@@ tations for what it was worth a good pair je@@ ans , went up .
i had very low expec@@ tations . i had no con@@ cre@@ te expec@@ tations than they could only have in a kind of a way .
when they came to 100 species , they would have to be perfect , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got good was , but it was not perfect .
and so i compared what i expected to , and what i expected was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment in compar@@ ison with what i expected .
the ad@@ ding of opportunities in the lives of people inevi@@ ted inevi@@ t@@ ably the expec@@ tations that people have about how they &apos;re going to be doing so well .
and that leads to less satis@@ fac@@ tion with the results , even when the results are good .
no one in the spor@@ ts world knows this , because if you would , because if you were to , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
but the truth is more like this .
the reason is that the whole thing was better than anything worse than anything , when anything worse was , it was possible for people to make experience that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we are weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , perfe@@ ction -- the best thing to hope -- things that you can never hope for you are as good as you would expect them .
they &apos;re never pleas@@ ant surprise , because their expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , are hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what all of you have come -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
i want to say -- a short auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phic moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really , really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t ab@@ and@@ on me .
but ab@@ and@@ oning is not always such a bad thing .
finally , an out@@ put of the buying of a mis@@ si@@ le je@@ ans when there &apos;s only one way to buy is that if you &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why who is necessary , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you have done ?
when hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and they buy one of the dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
and it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is it &apos;s : you .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans in the front ri@@ dge , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about , they acc@@ use themselves .
clinical depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant com@@ bat with this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experienced the dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment because their standards are so high , because their standards are so high , and then , if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think it would be their fau@@ lt .
and so the refle@@ ction is that it &apos;s generally better , it goes on generally , obje@@ ctive , and we feel bad .
so let me rec@@ all you .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , which one we all think for accu@@ rate , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than any choice than zero , but it doesn &apos;t follow that much more choice than something .
there &apos;s a ma@@ gical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve mis@@ sed this place a long time to improve our collective interests .
now , as a basic question -- i &apos;m nearly done -- as a basic issue , the thing about thinking about it , and what all of these choices are allo@@ cated in the industri@@ alized societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we heard from many of them , whose problem is not the big sele@@ ction .
your problem is that you have too little .
so , the things that i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and suff@@ oc@@ ent : steve le@@ vi@@ tt told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard to have car se@@ ats -- it &apos;s a waste of money . it &apos;s a waste of
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they &apos;re actually doing .
they worry for what we are up there .
if something of what makes people of our society allow so to make decisions of our societies in which people would have too little choice , not only would impro@@ v@@ ise the lives of the people , but our dig@@ ni@@ ty will be impro@@ ved .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ vement .
income is going to make it make you better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are colli@@ ded to us .
finally , let me read this carto@@ on , and read this carto@@ on , and , you say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know it &apos;s possible in this gold glass glass . &quot;
terri@@ fied ph@@ ant@@ as@@ is , a shor@@ t-@@ term view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the idea that the fish knew something .
because the truth is , when you break the ic@@ fish glass , everything is possible , they don &apos;t have any freedom . they have paraly@@ sis .
if you break the ic@@ fish glass , everything is possible , they send happiness .
they stre@@ tch the paraly@@ sis and they un@@ plu@@ g happiness .
everyone needs an ic@@ fish glass .
this is almost limited to very limited security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the thi@@ m thing is from a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ fish glass glass is a reci@@ pe for ad@@ v@@ ance , and i sus@@ pe@@ ct of disaster .
thank you very much indeed .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before about the human genome and what this could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new life and build .
and we always tried to ask important questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i believe that a lot of bi@@ ologists tried to understand and that at different levels .
we have tried multiple approach@@ es to simpli@@ fy it on the minim@@ al components .
we op@@ pli@@ c@@ ated almost 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , we sequen@@ ced the transition from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology to the digital world of biology .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , can we re@@ generate life , or do we create new life , out of this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma fer@@ tal@@ ari@@ za@@ city , that has the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate itself in the lab , and we have to try to do it with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve been able to get it to about a hundred genes of the 500 or something that are here .
but when we look at this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , which is very simple to us , compared to ours . trust me , that &apos;s easy . but if we look at all of these genes that we can elimin@@ ate one after the other , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that this is the only way to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some , to actually trans@@ late this chromo@@ some , to modi@@ fy the individual components , and therefore to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started asking with the question , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
able to create the chemistry to make these really big molecules that have never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromo@@ some ?
a chromo@@ some is so way , right next to just a piece of chemical material .
our steps in the edi@@ ti@@ fication of life were exponenti@@ al .
our ability to write genetic code has been evol@@ ving very slowly , but it &apos;s still increasing , and our lat@@ est point would now be put on an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
we started . we started 15 years ago .
and in fact , it took a few years earlier with a bio@@ eth@@ ical stat@@ ement before we did the first experiments .
and as it turns out , dna syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zation is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world can make the small bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process , the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could assem@@ ble these little pieces , and we could cor@@ rect the mistakes .
this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information , the genome ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria killing bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a com@@ mission cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ment , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we got this piece of in@@ ert chemical and gave it into a bacteria , and the bacteri@@ um started reading the genetic code and made vi@@ ral particles .
the vi@@ ral particles were then rele@@ ased by the cells , and came back and killed e@@ . col@@ i .
so , recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they seemed to stop this model .
they laugh@@ ed more than you do it here .
so , we think that this is a situation in the software to actually build your hard@@ ware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some . it has over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters genetic code . so we thought , we build it in a ta@@ pe of the virus that we could vari@@ ed the size of the ta@@ pe to understand what the individual compon@@ ent of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information at the computer , this digital information has to be really mis@@ er@@ able .
when we first sequen@@ ced the genome in 199@@ 5 , the er@@ ror rate in a mistake per 10,000 pa@@ irs was per 10,000 pair pair .
so we found 30 mistakes . if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and over@@ la@@ pping with 50@@ 0-@@ letter bub@@ bles to build smaller sub-@@ un@@ its to fit smaller sub-@@ un@@ its together to fit them together .
we built unique elements in there .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve put water@@ sig@@ ns in .
think about it : we have a four@@ -@@ letter code : a , a , c , g and t .
these letters -- these letters co@@ ating about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there &apos;s a single degree for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phr@@ ase , thoughts .
ini@@ tially , we only sig@@ ned sig@@ ned .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it wasn &apos;t a poetry .
we engine@@ ered the pieces so that we could just tag them with enzy@@ mes , and there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair them and then put them back together .
and we &apos;ve started to create pieces , starting with pieces of five to seven thousand letters , put them together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter bits to put it back together , up to 7@@ 2,000 .
in each shot , we had these pieces in return , so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of the auto@@ ma@@ tion .
so this , it looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball bil@@ yo@@ ff .
if we get these really big st@@ ones -- with over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e@@ . col@@ i , it &apos;s increasing all the possibility of modern molecular biology , and so we turn ourselves to other mechanis@@ ms .
we knew from a mechan@@ ism of the hom@@ ologist re@@ combin@@ ation , using biology to re@@ pair dna that can assem@@ ble these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of that . there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ago that &apos;s on three million bi@@ ke of radiation .
you can see on the inside of the field , his chromo@@ some just dro@@ ps apart .
for 12 to 24 hours later , everything has been re@@ moved to the same way as it was .
so we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely blo@@ wn up , they can actually live to live in vac@@ u@@ um .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move around , looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there is a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a found of the molecule that we made using these processes using -- actually , we used he@@ ating mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces of the pieces we &apos;ve ad@@ ded it , and then ye@@ ast ad@@ ds it auto@@ matically .
this is not a scan@@ ning scan@@ ning , it &apos;s a regular microscop@@ ic .
it &apos;s such a big molecule , that we can even see it with the light microscop@@ e .
this is over a six seconds &apos; time .
that &apos;s the publi@@ cation that we &apos;ve just been rele@@ asing recently .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with absolute structure that has ever been created by people .
it &apos;s got a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we could print it with a newspaper size of 10 and without circum@@ stances it would inclu@@ de 14@@ 2 pages , just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we start a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s a lot more sophisti@@ cated with bacteria .
it &apos;s as easier when you &apos;re in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ites like we &apos;re doing , you just take the nu@@ cle@@ us out and you have another in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re all talking about at the kl@@ on .
arch@@ a@@ e@@ bacteria , integr@@ ated the chromo@@ some into the cell , but just recently , we show that you can transp@@ l@@ ant a complete transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ som@@ es from one cell to the other and it can activ@@ ate it .
we placed the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ bes of micro@@ bes . well , they were saying , well , these two as close to each other like humans and mi@@ ce . we gave some extra genes to solve this chromo@@ some . we put it with enzy@@ mes to destro@@ y all the proteins . and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell -- and they &apos;re valu@@ ed our very sophisti@@ cated illu@@ stra@@ tions here .
the new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring the process on .
and this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have a second chromo@@ some or a third of each subject from any time , thousands of characteri@@ stics each time thousands of tra@@ its in just a second .
so people that think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time has a lot of mis@@ sed of biology .
there are enzy@@ mes the restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes are called dna that are actually di@@ mming dna .
the chromo@@ some that was in the cell was not one , the chromo@@ som@@ es that we &apos;ve put in .
it was expres@@ sed in the cell , and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as alien material , and so we had only one cell with a new chromo@@ some .
it was color@@ ed blue because of the genes that we had em@@ bed@@ ded .
and after a very short period of time , it lost all the characteri@@ stics of species and completely conver@@ ted into a new species on the new software that we gave up into the cell .
all the proteins changed the mem@@ bran@@ es -- when we were las@@ ing the genetic code , it was exactly what we trans@@ fer@@ red .
it may sound genom@@ ic al@@ ch@@ our y , but we can use by shif@@ ting the software dna , changing things quite dra@@ matically .
now , i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that this is not the gen@@ es@@ is -- that is based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we might be able to create a new kind of cam@@ brian explosion , where there might be massive new education education based on this digital design .
so why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re growing from si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
today , three people on this planet are three people on this planet for every year in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there will be four .
we have problems with food , with fru@@ it and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge to offer for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0-@@ plus billion , 3@@ 0-@@ bar@@ rier oil . that &apos;s a hundred million off@@ ers a day .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 coming from this material that land@@ ed in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our disco@@ disco@@ zation from all over the world , a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electr@@ on@@ ter industry had a do@@ zen components and look at the diversity of it .
we &apos;re missing pri@@ mar@@ ily on the boundar@@ ies of biological reality and of those of us who we think .
we have technologies today based on this fast syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing techni@@ que to do it what we &apos;re calling a combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gene@@ tics .
we have the possibility now to build a large robot that can make millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes , or optimi@@ ze this process to optimi@@ ze oc@@ tober , or drugs new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can change more molecular biology with a simple team than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just a second sele@@ ction . we can sele@@ ct life ability , we can sele@@ ct energy from chemicals or fuel efficiency v@@ acc@@ ine and so on .
this is a picture of actual design software that we &apos;re working on that you can actually sit up with and design new species on computers .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look exactly what their genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re foc@@ using on the green@@ 80 generation of fu@@ els now .
you &apos;ve recently seen cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol what &apos;s just a bad experiment .
we have the fuel of the second and third generation of the second few things that will come out pretty much out of much higher so@@ verage , like oc@@ ch or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but , as we think that the only way with biology is a big influence without any amount of increase on food or limit@@ ation of their avail@@ ability , if we see co2 as a source of neurons , and so we work on cells who go along this path .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first carb@@ on-@@ gener@@ ated source of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s in about 18 months .
sun@@ light and co2 are a way .
and but in our disco@@ disco@@ sts of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organis@@ m that we &apos;ve described in 199@@ 6 .
it lives in the deep sea , about a quar@@ ter and a half miles deep , with almost cooking water temper@@ atures .
it conver@@ ts co2 in me@@ than@@ e as a source of hydro@@ gen as a source source .
we &apos;re explor@@ ing whether we can use pollu@@ ted co2 , which could simply be used to regu@@ late the co2 in fuel , in order to power this process .
in a short period of time , we believe that we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moder@@ ates goals like the re@@ plac@@ ement of the whole pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry . right . so if you could not do that at ted , where else ? a pri@@ mate source of energy .
but because of that , we &apos;re currently working to integra@@ te the same approach@@ es for the development of vac@@ cin@@ es .
you saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back to the back and have a dollar too little when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
i think that this can be changed by building re@@ com@@ pres@@ sive vac@@ cin@@ es in the interests .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes , but today can be acceler@@ ated today by the evolutionary tree with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ es , and possibly eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ites .
we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ed to make people better about it , and our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i promis@@ ed back to them , to expla@@ ining how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for those of those who didn &apos;t exist at all at that time , the l@@ h@@ c is the biggest scientific experiment that ever was stopped -- 27 miles in diam@@ e@@ ter .
the job is to create the conditions that exi@@ sted less than one billi@@ on@@ th of the universe in the beginning of the universe , and up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just just brea@@ th@@ taking ambi@@ tious .
this is the machine underneath gen@@ ev@@ a .
we take images of these mini@@ -@@ big gates in dete@@ c@@ tors .
that &apos;s what i work at . he &apos;s called at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters in the base , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
here &apos;s a spec@@ tac@@ ular picture of the at@@ las in the construction of the construction so you see the scale .
on september 10 , last year , the machine was running for the first time .
and this picture was recor@@ ded by at@@ las .
it gener@@ ates real ju@@ g@@ ger in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first str@@ aus@@ y partic@@ le that came back the entire distance to the l@@ h@@ c , then with one part of the l@@ h@@ c colli@@ ded to put a rain of particles on the dete@@ ctor .
in other words , when we saw this image on the 10@@ th of september , we knew the machine worked , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph .
i don &apos;t know if this was creating the greatest ju@@ g , or this one , as somebody would visit the google side and find the slide .
it means that we achieve a cultural impact bes@@ i@@ de the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machin@@ ery that had to do with these wir@@ es here -- these gold dra@@ dra@@ tions here .
these wir@@ es go 13@@ -@@ thousand thousand cu@@ ps when this machine is head@@ ing up at high power .
well , the engineers who are going to look at you and say , &quot; no you don &apos;t do that . these are little wir@@ es . &quot;
they can afford that , because if you cool them very far , they become called the super@@ conduc@@ t@@ ary .
so with min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the room between the stars , these wir@@ es can hold the ten@@ sion .
in one of the connections , between over 6@@ 3,000 magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a shi@@ ec@@ te@@ -@@ fru@@ it .
so the wir@@ es of small@@ -@@ made , 13@@ -@@ 500 am@@ p@@ ber@@ ters en@@ counter@@ ed suddenly electric resi@@ stance .
this was the out@@ come .
now , all of this is even more impres@@ sive if you imagine that the mag@@ net wei@@ gh@@ s over 20 tons and reach@@ ed about 30 in@@ ches .
so we cele@@ br@@ ated about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
and i had to re@@ move them , which we did .
we changed her re@@ pair . she re@@ pair them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back to their journey .
by the end of mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be oper@@ able again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and expect to be able to collect first data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and we &apos;re continu@@ ing our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , like such acci@@ dent@@ al acci@@ dents , the deb@@ ates about the value of science and engineering are about such boundar@@ ies . it &apos;s easy to re@@ je@@ ct such something like that
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to take the fact that we take beyond our limit@@ ations , creating the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i &apos;m going to give my conclu@@ sive words to a chri@@ gi@@ an scientist . go@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , i think , considered when he defen@@ ded the us@@ less experiments of his teaching , his teaching , michael far@@ a@@ day , that said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the progress of the human spirit than to think that our scientific ideas are complete , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are immedi@@ ate , and that there are no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
thank you very much .
i &apos;m a no@@ ve@@ list .
so writing books is my job , but it is , of course , more than that
it &apos;s also my big , life@@ -@@ long love and fascin@@ ation .
and i don &apos;t expect to ever change it .
however , funny of something weird in my life and my career has happened to re@@ think me to completely re@@ think my relationship with this work .
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called two , pra@@ y , love , pra@@ y , love -- that , in fact , i had my previous books come out of the world , for some reason , and a big me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , international s@@ eller thing .
the result is that , because i come from , wher@@ ever i come , than i &apos;m being driven to the end of the road .
seriously , got out of the board !
for example , they &apos;re excited to stand up to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear they &apos;re never going to miss this success ?
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to pass your whole life and never create a book that interest someone in the world ? never again ? watch ?
okay , that &apos;s really getting really coura@@ ge .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was talking about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager for the first time , that i wanted to be writer with the same kind of an@@ gi@@ fied interpretation .
people said , don &apos;t you fear to succe@@ ed succe@@ eding ?
don &apos;t you have afraid you need to change the hu@@ mili@@ ty of a vote ?
don &apos;t you worry that you leave this cra@@ ve your life after@@ wards and never reach@@ es something , and you &apos;re going to die on a bang@@ on pat@@ ade of dreams -- your mouth filled with the bit@@ ter a@@ hn of failure ? figure for your mouth filled with the bit@@ ter a@@ on ?
that &apos;s how , you know .
and the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , look , yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of all these things .
and i always had .
and i sc@@ ared a lot more stuff that would no one would get fru@@ strated .
how al@@ ga@@ e -- and other fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things .
but when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , and i &apos;ve been asking myself , why ?
is it sensi@@ ble ?
is it logi@@ cal that if someone should be expected by someone to do the work that he feels was excited to do the work that he
and what &apos;s the thing with creative entreprene@@ pu@@ tions that they don &apos;t make us un@@ certain about the individual spirit of psychiat@@ ity -- in a way how other professi@@ ons don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemi@@ sts and i can &apos;t remember situation in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist that he was asked if he was afraid to be a chem@@ ist .
with your chem@@ ist block@@ ade , john -- how do you do it with this ?
it just wasn &apos;t going to know , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chem@@ ist hasn &apos;t received the call of al@@ co@@ hol over the cent@@ u@@ ries of al@@ co@@ hol depres@@ sing people .
we &apos;re repor@@ ters who seem to have this kind of call , but not only the wri@@ ters , but the crea@@ tives of all gen@@ ru@@ es seem to have this repu@@ tation , ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
all you have to do is to look at the more wi@@ der death numbers of really great vot@@ ing from the 20th century alone that died young and often killed by their own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually deliver su@@ i@@ cide , they seemed to be really ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted by their tal@@ ents .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er just said before his death in his last interview , each of my books have killed me a little further .
it &apos;s an extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can do about your life work .
but we don &apos;t even pause when we hear somebody like this , because we know this kind of thing for such a long time , and somehow we have the idea so bro@@ ad and colle@@ c@@ tively accep@@ ted that creativity and suffering are kind of con@@ sequence together that creativity and suffering -- at the end -- always leads to the se@@ tin@@ -@@ fac@@ tor@@ ing .
the question i want to ask everybody i &apos;d like to ask today is : is this idea for you right ?
are you feeling familiar with this ? because with just a centi@@ meter back@@ late -- i don &apos;t really feel involved with this notion .
i think they &apos;re ol@@ d-@@ num@@ bing .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see it being taken on to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we &apos;re living our great creative education .
and i know , for me , that it &apos;s -- in my situation -- very dangerous to starting , to start this dark path of reas@@ oning , especially in the context that i &apos;m just present in my career .
that &apos;s called -- see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i &apos;ve probably got another 40 working years in me .
and it &apos;s especially likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now about the world as the work , which came after the graduate success of my last book , is right ?
i &apos;ll tell you very quickly , because we &apos;re all kind of friends now -- it &apos;s most likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jes@@ us , what &apos;s the thought !
that &apos;s the kind of thoughts that can get somebody to start drin@@ king 9 in the morning , drin@@ king g@@ in , and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d further like to keep doing this work that i love .
and so the question is : how is it ?
after a while of obser@@ ving , i seem to think that to keep writing , i have to keep writing some kind of absor@@ ber@@ ing psych@@ ological constru@@ ct .
i somehow have to find from now on to a path@@ way in writing a sec@@ ure distance between me and my very natural gra@@ ve about how the reaction will be to the written .
while i looked for models in the last year for models to do that , i also looked in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see whether they might have better or more difficult ideas than how to help to deal crea@@ tively with the emotional risks that are associated with creativity .
this qu@@ est led me to the ancient gre@@ ek is@@ lands and the old ro@@ me .
please join me , because the circle is going to re@@ connect .
but in the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce of gre@@ e@@ ce and ro@@ me , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ v@@ ine di@@ ving spirit , which comes from a dist@@ ant un@@ known source to people -- un@@ know@@ able , un@@ known reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these di@@ v@@ ine g@@ ho@@ st of creativity of creativity of the creativity of the world .
from soc@@ ri@@ ts , he thought he thought he believed he had a d@@ ong he shared for a long time .
the ro@@ man had the same idea , called this kind of body embar@@ ras@@ sing mind a little bit of a second geni@@ us .
that &apos;s great . the ro@@ wer didn &apos;t really think that a geni@@ us was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine cre@@ ature that was believed that it was always living in the walls of a arti@@ at@@ ter -- something like do@@ bby , the fourth -- that came out and helped the artists in the work literally un@@ legi@@ ti@@ mate and helped the result of work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there &apos;s this , there &apos;s the gap i &apos;ve talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that prote@@ cting you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it worked like that , right ?
the artist of the peri@@ ods was prote@@ cted by certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew that you had this powerful geni@@ us that helped you .
if your work was fli@@ pping -- not entirely your mistakes , doesn &apos;t it ?
everyone knew your geni@@ us was a little bit of a tin .
that &apos;s how people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was , let &apos;s bring the human individual to the center of the universe -- about all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies . and there &apos;s no room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures to assu@@ me the orders of the di@@ v@@ ine .
it &apos;s the beginn@@ ings of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people who call a geni@@ us , or whose artist , a geni@@ us -- not enough to have a geni@@ us
i have to tell you , i think it was a big er@@ ror .
you know , i think to allow a m@@ ere person that he thinks he or she is like the ves@@ sel , like the b@@ ars and the source and the source of all of the di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ known , infin@@ ite , infin@@ ite myster@@ y is a little bit too much responsibility to kill them of a fra@@ gr@@ om@@ y of human psychology .
it &apos;s like somebody to please sho@@ ck the sun .
this de@@ pic@@ ts and re@@ je@@ cts all e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ reach@@ able expec@@ tations of the success .
i think that this happiness risk has wi@@ ped our artists of the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s right , -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe a aging understanding about the relationship between people and the myster@@ y of the crea@@ tives .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just elimin@@ ate the thought of 500 years of good human@@ ism in an 18@@ -@@ minute lec@@ ture .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would report really ad@@ ju@@ sted scientific dou@@ bt about the idea of -- basically -- fe@@ es that people are looking at and il@@ fair@@ y on their projects and so forth .
i &apos;m not sure all of you can take this journey on this trip .
but the question that i &apos;m trying to throw up is : why not ?
now , why not think about it ?
because it makes as much sense as anything that i &apos;ve heard of , when it came about to explain the absolutely crazy mo@@ bility mo@@ bility of creative process .
a process that is -- as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everybody actually be@@ ats -- doesn &apos;t always understand meaning@@ ful .
in fact , it can be difficult to feel really par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
i had a close focus when i met the extraordinary american diet ru@@ th stone , who was now 90 , but who was li@@ sted their whole lives , and she told me that when she was growing in the village virg@@ ini@@ a , she told me that she was growing up in the fields , she said she would feel and hear like a po@@ em about the landscape to come to her .
she said it was like a th@@ um@@ bing train out of air .
they would fli@@ p over the land .
she felt when it came , because it was going to bring the earth under her feet .
she knew that she could do just one such second in one such moment , and that was -- in her words -- fli@@ pping like the de@@ vil is finished .
she ran like the de@@ vil to the house while she was tra@@ pped by this po@@ em , and it was only about giving them fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil to get it into a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil so they could capture it through cu@@ es and cla@@ at on the paper .
in other words , she was not fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she reach@@ ed and ran the house , and the po@@ em roll@@ ed through her , and she conf@@ used it . she said it kept moving across the land and she said , &quot; watch out of the country after another po@@ et .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget the part -- she said that there were moments in which they almost rand@@ om@@ ly mis@@ sed it .
so , you run the house , and you look for the paper , and the po@@ em comes through you , and it just grab@@ s a pen as it goes through them , and then -- -- it was like , you know , with your other hand , and you get it to ka@@ b it .
and she got the po@@ em on his tail , and then moved it back into her body , and took it on the she@@ et of paper .
and for these od@@ ds , the po@@ em came in and in@@ t@@ act on paper -- but back@@ wards -- from the last word , first .
when i was watching this , i thought , i &apos;m more sever@@ e -- this is exactly how my creative process is oc@@ curr@@ ing .
it &apos;s not like my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel .
i &apos;m a mou@@ l@@ maker . to be able to work , i have to stand up at the same time and swe@@ at , cal@@ m down and really un@@ pleas@@ ant .
but even i &apos;ve st@@ um@@ bled this thing in my po@@ l@@ stream species sometimes .
and i sus@@ pe@@ ct many of you have been doing it too .
i even worked or some ideas that came through a source of a source of a source that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we end with this in relationship without losing our minds , but in the contr@@ ary of keeping us in a more intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this is the musi@@ cian tom wa@@ di@@ art . i &apos;ve had to interview him for a magazine a few years ago .
we talked about this top@@ ic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the well-@@ trained modern artist who was trying to control these un@@ controll@@ able creative pul@@ ses that lived in his house and engage with them .
but then he got older and harder , he told me that one day he got on a fa@@ st@@ dri@@ way in los angeles , and there was all changing for him .
he went with a high speed when he &apos;s hearing a small frag@@ ment of the tun@@ e , the way it &apos;s often un@@ tan@@ k@@ able for him , and he wants to have it . she &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous . he &apos;s done it , but he &apos;s not able to en@@ sure it .
it doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe recor@@ der .
so , he starts to acceler@@ ate this old cu@@ p in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing and get tra@@ pped by this song on ever@@ right .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not making it . summer .
but instead of p@@ ani@@ cked , he stopped listening .
he left the whole thought , and did a whole new .
he just looked into the sky , and she said , &quot; look sorry , can you see i drive a car ? stars is change ? &quot;
right is it that i &apos;ve just been able to write a song ?
if you really want to exist , you &apos;re going to get a mis@@ er@@ able moment when i can focus on you .
if not , br@@ ing@@ les today somebody else .
go and artic@@ ate leon@@ ard co@@ hen . rio .
his whole work has changed after@@ wards .
not the work itself . it was often as dark as bee@@ h and ever .
but the process and the heavy ad@@ mission that surro@@ unds him , was li@@ t when he got the geni@@ us out , where he had nothing more than a de@@ er and left to him where he was somehow going , and he realized that it was no more a broken , qu@@ and@@ ing thing .
it could give a kinder , mira@@ cul@@ ous , bizar@@ re partner , a kind of conversation between tom and the foreign , challen@@ ging thing , that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard that story , it also changed a little bit the way i was working , and it saved me .
this idea saved me when i was in the writing process of pictures , pra@@ y , love was . i dro@@ pped into one of these cu@@ ts of the second place that we all fell when we &apos;re working on something and it didn &apos;t happen . you start to think that it &apos;s a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book that has ever been written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just put the project out .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed tom was talking in the fre@@ e-@@ sky , and i tried .
so i took my view from man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt , and i spoke to my com@@ ment on a blan@@ k corner of the room .
i said , &quot; who@@ n to , you know , you and , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not entirely my fau@@ lt , right ?
because you can see that i &apos;m spending all i &apos;m spending . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you have to cross up here and keep your percentage of dis@@ order .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t like that ... you know what , then the he@@ ck with it .
i &apos;m still going to keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a proto@@ col@@ s that i was today for my part of jobs .
because -- ... at the end it &apos;s like followed . from cent@@ u@@ ries , from cent@@ u@@ ries , in the desert north of northern africa and music pil@@ ed up with hol@@ y dan@@ cers and music that were sus@@ pen@@ ded for hours -- to the da@@ wn .
these sc@@ is@@ sor@@ s were always great , because the dan@@ cers were professional , and they were fantastic .
but every once and again , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something special happened , one of the per@@ form@@ ers was actually oc@@ curr@@ ing .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you all saw one of your life in your life before .
it was like time was standing sil@@ ence , and the dan@@ cers were walking through a kind of p@@ for@@ te , he did nothing different than he had ever done before -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before . but it was all gather@@ ed .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t appear ab@@ und@@ ant even longer .
it was clo@@ sely open by inside , and ligh@@ ted from below , and everything kno@@ cked through a di@@ v@@ ine fire .
when this happened , people knew what that was , and they called it with his name .
they put the hands together , and they started sing@@ ing : mirror al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god .
this is god , do you know ?
interesting histor@@ ic foot@@ print : when the mo@@ ses sou@@ sp@@ in brought out this practice , they brought this action . the ep@@ ill changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries of alex@@ al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h piano to broad@@ ol@@ ene , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , that you can still fight in cra@@ f@@ ts and fl@@ ame dan@@ cers .
if an actor in spa@@ in in spa@@ in , bas@@ al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , is something that has done something impossible : mirror al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ vo , al@@ la@@ h , great , patter@@ ny star is un@@ stable , it &apos;s a more el@@ abor@@ ate look towards god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the tri@@ cky part follo@@ ws the next morning , when the dan@@ cers wake up and reali@@ zes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;@@ clock on a tu@@ es@@ day -- and he no longer car@@ ries a five-@@ round of god .
it &apos;s just an aging cur@@ ent with pain@@ t@@ ling k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe it will never again rise to these hei@@ ghts .
and maybe nobody will never call god &apos;s name when he ro@@ tat@@ es , but what does he want to start with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ ds of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite as big a p@@ in if they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of their existence would come from you .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a pole -- from an incredible source of your life that &apos;s distribu@@ ted to someone else , when they &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it as this , all of this changes .
so i started thinking , and i think with my last month , while i was working on the book that followed soon -- as soon as the dangerous , sc@@ ary , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , well-@@ determin@@ ed success@@ or of my ini@@ tial me@@ as .
what i have to say constantly when i &apos;m going to talk about it is , don &apos;t have any fear .
it &apos;s not im@@ pris@@ oned .
you just do your job .
must be contribu@@ ted for your contribu@@ tion , whatever it wants to be .
if your job is dan@@ cing , tan@@ se .
if the du@@ m@@ b thing that is edi@@ ted to you is deci@@ ding to you , deci@@ pher@@ ing a cure of wonder through your effort for a moment , then analy@@ z@@ ler ! watch .
and if , not even , dan@@ te is your dance .
and saturn ol@@ p@@ é ! look for it against all of that .
i believe that in it , and i feel that we should teach .
bas@@ ol@@ é ! right for all you , despite all of that , just for you , simply that you have the na@@ sty human love and the mind to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
ol@@ é !
last year , i showed these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s , which had about three million years the size of the bottom 4@@ 8 states , was s@@ hr@@ in@@ k by 40 percent .
but it doesn &apos;t write very much the simpl@@ est of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thi@@ ck@@ ness of ice .
in a certain sense , the arc@@ tic ice cap@@ s is the be@@ ating heart of our global climate system .
it gro@@ ws in winter , and s@@ hr@@ in@@ ks in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se oc@@ curr@@ out@@ ement in the last 25 years .
the perman@@ ent ice is contain@@ ed with red mar@@ ks .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue . this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it &apos;s s@@ hr@@ in@@ king in summer .
what &apos;s called the ad@@ ded ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood that &apos;s fli@@ pping out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here .
this is a problem , because the air is rele@@ ased the fro@@ zen cause to the arc@@ tic ocean , where there &apos;s large quanti@@ ties of fro@@ zen carbon , which , when it turns , is trans@@ fer@@ red to the micro@@ bes of me@@ than@@ e .
compared to the full amount of climate trans@@ actions in the atmosphere , this is going to double dou@@ bling if we tran@@ sc@@ end this critical point .
today , today in some flat la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e from itself , they ta@@ p out of the water .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ters at university in al@@ as@@ ka is travel@@ ing with another group of work at the other flat la@@ ke of the last winter .
who@@ a !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how &apos;s it going to happen to us ?
and one reason is , this vast heat of heat is foreig@@ ning green@@ land from the
this is a year of an@@ nu@@ al rain flow .
but the volu@@ me are much larger than ever before .
this is the do@@ unt l@@ us@@ l@@ us@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know what the sea level is with land@@ ic@@ ing clim@@ bing through land ice here , it &apos;s flu@@ sting into the sea .
these ri@@ vers are taking even the same .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ic@@ e@@ al mass on the planet .
last month , researchers repor@@ ted that the entire continent now has a low ice foot@@ print .
and the west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which is spu@@ ned by a few under@@ water is@@ lands , is particularly strong in mel@@ ting .
this is equivalent to 20 feet of sea hei@@ ght , as bio@@ land .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the thir@@ d-@@ largest ic@@ e@@ ar mass , you see on the top of new la@@ kes that were gl@@ aci@@ er a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ k@@ water water from this mel@@ ting water .
in the and@@ es , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the hydro@@ carb@@ on resource for this city .
the water pil@@ es have been zo@@ o@@ zing .
but when you lose , most of the drin@@ king water will fall away .
in california , a 40 percent redu@@ ction of the si@@ er@@ ra cei@@ ling of the si@@ er@@ ra .
this is because of the memory bas@@ ks .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read them , are serious .
these ex@@ pul@@ sions around the world creates to a dra@@ matic rate of fir@@ es .
and the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es around the world have never resul@@ ted in a really extraordinary and not before it ever out@@ bor@@ ted .
four times so many forward in the last 30 years than in the previous thir@@ d-@@ trillion .
this is a completely un@@ hal@@ vable develop@@ mental pattern .
if you look at this in the histor@@ ical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
and in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons everyday every day in the oceans .
look at the do@@ main of the eastern pacific , right , from the american continent of west and both the axis of the indian sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a des@@ per@@ ate dec@@ line of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single dig@@ it for global warming , against de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fu@@ els .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest thing to do .
the united states is one of the two largest pollu@@ t@@ ters , together with china .
and the sugge@@ sti@@ on was to build a lot of other coal fac@@ tor@@ ies .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that were recor@@ ded in the last few years with some of the green alterna@@ tives that have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
i think that &apos;s a political debate in our country .
and the co@@ hl@@ ines and o@@ iled du@@ stri@@ es have spent a quar@@ ter-@@ billion dollars last satur@@ a year to measure clean coal , which is already a resi@@ stance in it .
so , that image remin@@ ded me of something .
when christ@@ mas came around me , at home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion tons of co@@ her@@ ese .
you didn &apos;t seem to see it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the second largest ab@@ und@@ ance of america .
this is what happened at christ@@ mas .
one of the ko@@ hl@@ on &apos; s of the co@@ hl@@ ine industry was this one .
ho@@ dy the fossi@@ man is a deli@@ ght@@ ful , happy boy .
it &apos;s got it in bo@@ ir@@ y and poverty in america , and it helps our economy grow .
fro@@ sty , the carbon man becomes cle@@ aner every single day .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and des@@ ir@@ able , and fe@@ e@@ sta@@ sty and bread sta@@ ys in fo@@ ster and bread .
this is the source of most of the coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the most powerful mile wor@@ ker is the g@@ ate@@ of of mas@@ sey desert .
let me tell you one very clearly . al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry ri@@ d , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has repor@@ ted two pro@@ fil@@ es .
this is one , a part of it .
at co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we see climate change as a serious dan@@ ger for our business .
so we led it to the top line , to spend a si@@ x-@@ sour@@ ced money to bring an argument on the way to bring the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not mu@@ ck@@ ness .
we think she &apos;s clean -- and we &apos;re also sm@@ elling well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave that quie@@ t .
sau@@ dy coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a separate of this modern , clean carbon factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty lou@@ m@@ le .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean co@@ al-@@ nan@@ la@@ ged technology .
and yet , burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remark@@ ably clean co@@ al-@@ led technology , which you see here , changes everything .
and just look at it , this is the clean , clean co@@ al-@@ technology technology .
finally , the positive alternative of our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
in america , america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thre@@ w that conne@@ cts all of these , we &apos;re our depen@@ dence on carbon dio@@ xide fu@@ els like dir@@ ty coal and ferti@@ li@@ ty oil .
but now there is a coura@@ ge@@ ous , new solution to get us out of this stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward situation .
fe@@ eding america with 100 percent clean electricity over the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work , to make us sa@@ fer and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
sen@@ ior america . find more out .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a new govern@@ ance of america .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways of re@@ duc@@ ing our depen@@ dence of old , dir@@ ty fu@@ els that are ob@@ tain@@ ing our world .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new invest@@ ments to create well-@@ paying jobs .
hand@@ ness america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african pro@@ ver@@ say : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to get far , and we need to get fast .
thank you very much .
i want to start by asking you to think back to your childhood , when they played with com@@ modi@@ ties .
but as she recogni@@ zes how to dist@@ ingu@@ ish the hands and embra@@ ce the blocks , they actually started to learn to think and to fundament@@ ate issues and to solve issues by understanding and change struc@@ tural link .
the spa@@ tial thinking is ti@@ ck@@ fully related to how we understand a vast environment .
as a neuro@@ scientist , inspired by the way our interaction with real objects -- together with my science ad@@ oles@@ cents pat@@ ti and my collea@@ gue je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i started mar@@ vel : what if we use computers , rather than a mouse ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment , which moves like a digital finger@@ ti@@ p on a flat operating surface ... what if we could interven@@ e with both hands and do it physi@@ cally and could the way we want to do it
that question was so he@@ ating that we started to investi@@ gate the answer and the si@@ st@@ ure .
in short , an el@@ vable computer is an inter@@ active computer in the size of a small coo@@ k@@ ie .
they can move with the hand , they can sense each other , they can map their mov@@ ements , and they have a screen and a spor@@ ting sor@@ thi@@ er .
more importantly , are physi@@ cal , so you can only pick them up like building blocks just by fre@@ ing out your hands and trying to move .
and the si@@ st@@ les are an example of a new generation of aid to the manipu@@ lation of digital data .
and when these tools get more powerful and develop a conscious awareness for their mov@@ ements , recogni@@ zing each other and feeling the ene@@ mi@@ ties of our way with them , then we can start to study new and more entertain@@ ing species .
i start with a couple of simple examples .
so this si@@ st@@ ness is con@@ characteri@@ sion@@ ed for the video re@@ mission , and if i ru@@ p it into a direction , the video will play ahead , if i p@@ p it to the other direction , it &apos;s walking back@@ wards .
and those inter@@ active portra@@ its take some other true portra@@ each other .
so if i leave them si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side , that &apos;s what they &apos;re interested in .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded by the inside , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can become something nervous .
and they feel their mov@@ ements as well and re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e .
one interesting result of the inter@@ actions that we started to recognize was that we could use everyday gest@@ ures , like scre@@ aming of colors like this , how to scre@@ w them with flu@@ ids .
in this case , we &apos;ve con@@ activ@@ ated three run@@ ls as a color po@@ t , and i can use them to po@@ ur paint in the middle , where they &apos;re mix@@ ed .
if we over@@ go it , we can send a little back back a little bit .
there are also some nice ways in education like languages , mathematical or lo@@ gic play , where we give people the possibility of fast experim@@ entation and want to see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series , which i &apos;m creating with a simple scale of data .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ g@@ bur@@ e .
basically , every round of a round on every hig@@ hl@@ able event happens to somebody , and as you &apos;re trying to form words , they &apos;re being re@@ sted over a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
then , after 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s mix@@ ed and you have to try a new letter combin@@ ation and new possibilities .
thank you very much .
these are some of the kids on a trip to the media lab , and i was able to get them to try it out , and taken a video of it .
they really loved it .
one of the interesting circum@@ stances about these kinds of appli@@ cations is you don &apos;t have to give people lots of instru@@ ction .
all you have to say is , &quot; manufac@@ ture words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
let me show you a few people that test it .
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest zi@@ ster at the bottom right here .
and it turned out he wanted the si@@ ties only to st@@ ack the si@@ ties .
so for him , they were just building bra@@ kes .
this is an inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ filter .
we wanted to develop a learning for language sch@@ ers .
so this is fe@@ li@@ x .
he can bring new characters into the scene by po@@ pping the el@@ ev@@ ate from the table , showing this character .
here , he &apos;s holding the sun .
the sun is going up .
now , he &apos;ll put a tra@@ ctor in the scene .
the or@@ an@@ an tra@@ ctor .
good work ! yeah .
by sha@@ king the el@@ ev@@ e and she can turn them si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side , he can inter@@ mit the characters ...
... inno@@ v@@ ate your own story .
hell@@ o !
it &apos;s a story with the open end , and he can decide how it &apos;s evol@@ ving .
flying c@@ at .
the last example i have of today to show it is a musi@@ cs for community that we &apos;ve developed recently , and that we &apos;ve recently developed in the si@@ st@@ le as a sound , like leadership , and &quot; b@@ ass and br@@ inger . &quot;
each has four different vari@@ ations ; you can pick up which one you want to use .
and you can feed this sound into the sequence that you can initi@@ ate in any patterns .
and you store it by simply holding a ton@@ gue si@@ st@@ able to a sequence of a cli@@ ent .
so there are effects that can alter live , such as hei@@ ght and filter .
you put it with a particular t@@ one , and then it starts to put it to the exhi@@ bi@@ tion .
and then , spra@@ y effects like speed and volu@@ me that app@@ lies to the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s have a look .
we start by putting the leadership in two trans@@ se@@ ders and organi@@ zing them in a row , and organi@@ zing them in a row , and ad@@ ding a little more of the voice .
now i &apos;m going to give a b@@ ass .
now i &apos;m going to do a little plu@@ g to do this .
and now i &apos;m going to match the filter with the w@@ inning , so i can control the effect of life .
i can speed up all the sequence by sli@@ p the p@@ ace into one or the other direction .
and now i &apos;m going to wind the fil@@ ter even for a little bit more .
i can change the sequence while it &apos;s going through .
so i don &apos;t have to plan them in the front , but they can impro@@ v@@ ise ; they quar@@ ch or to allow them in the mid@@ st .
and finally , i can send the whole sequence to the whole sequence by running the lou@@ d@@ less el@@ ev@@ able to the left .
thank you very much .
so as you can see , my exc@@ it@@ ement is to develop new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are better to fit like our brains and bodies .
and today , i &apos;ve had time to show you some of this new design world and some of the ways of expla@@ ining what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with is that we are at the th@@ res@@ hold to this new generation of wor@@ ker with digital media that &apos;s going to bring information to our world in our world that causes our dem@@ ands .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m looking forward to all conver@@ sa@@ tions with all of you
yeah , good after@@ noon .
i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so , what is bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ie supposed to be
i have to pick up a little bit , and it &apos;s bus@@ y concerned with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , i &apos;ve just been working with the bio@@ ha@@ cking a few years ago , and i &apos;ve started , because i just wanted to know more and it didn &apos;t want to do it in the first place , what i &apos;ve learned in college .
so , this was my primary motiv@@ ation .
so it was a curi@@ osity , and i wanted to sort of look closer on the matter , like that .
i think that molecular biology generally , i think , generally speaking , biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything that count you to count syn@@ thetic biology and so on .
cru@@ cially important , now , is extremely important , and much , much more important will be in the future .
there are so contro@@ versi@@ al things like these whole gene@@ tically engine@@ ered plants on the out@@ brea@@ ks .
there &apos;s now cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the united states , who are trying to make bio@@ ways , so gas from al@@ ga@@ e .
among then , there are things that are u@@ tter@@ ly in the everyday run , which most people don &apos;t realize , including was@@ hing enzy@@ mes that allow us to was@@ h with 4@@ 0-@@ degree ver@@ gi@@ an , is also gene@@ tically optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes .
and the list is able to continue end@@ less@@ ly .
and so from an interest in this technology , i kept on there on this technology , i
now , why are they ha@@ cking ?
most people know that out of the software level .
computers ha@@ ck , and then in the media it &apos;s always like , yes , the ha@@ ck@@ ers break in somewhere and b@@ old data and so on .
that &apos;s kind of very sad for ha@@ ck@@ fly &apos;s , because that &apos;s not what it really started with , and what it is that has actually be@@ ars on it .
and that was , the software ha@@ cker , in the &apos; 7@@ 0s , in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , started with computer machines , and that &apos;s also what the internet was done .
and it &apos;s about working on a play@@ ful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and so , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can just be a future problem , which is like simpli@@ fying things , so a random problem to send a question , and how to make it better or how to do it better .
and it &apos;s been just recently with software , but there &apos;s also a whole board in electr@@ on@@ ics , there &apos;s also a pole scene , there &apos;s also a pole scene that bub@@ bles all kinds of electr@@ on@@ ics .
and , now , also , on biology , i want to take this metaphor that comes out of syn@@ thetic biology , because , of biology , biology is really a bit of information science , because , so-@@ ah@@ n@@ .@@ a code , it &apos;s not equal as computers , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just cy@@ ber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code and you can make it hair , so you can ha@@ ck it , so i find that incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper into it .
that actually challen@@ ged two-@@ thousand eight , eight , these kinds of networks .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ ter@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe and with a co@@ operation in india built , but has now been members or active people all over the world .
this is what a more arti@@ stic exercise , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosop@@ her@@ s and working with scientists to express and to ask with these technologies and to ask questions and to analy@@ ze and to analy@@ ze , because there &apos;s museum vision and yes , all sorts of things .
but actually , it &apos;s always about finding such a more pleas@@ ure access , giving you a play@@ ful transformation with that .
and then there is do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ en@@ rich bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o .
this is a network from the united states , which is actually more like for@@ um where you &apos;re about to stand and disc@@ uss online .
they &apos;re a little bit of technical , and they &apos;re also a little entrepr@@ enti@@ al along , they &apos;re going to be asking , yeah , applied questions .
and based on these networks that the entire popular has done , it depen@@ ds to be a scene that i want to just portra@@ up .
so here in the image on the left on the left , you see bio@@ 2 , which is a ha@@ ck@@ space , so basically a school , so a private school , a non@@ profit operating facili@@ ty , where everybody can come .
kids , old , all sorts of people go there to just figure out , they &apos;ve launched a lab , and look at what you can do if these lab proto@@ proto@@ col@@ s .
so here on the left left is a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , hou@@ se@@ hold ct fi@@ ges is the ones that there &apos;s been a long time .
well , not long than these other two networks .
so also , it &apos;s in such an arti@@ stic event with biological materials and , yes , electr@@ on@@ ics buil@@ ders , and combin@@ ing it in a very l@@ ur@@ ny way .
a group from app@@ ar@@ a that i met a long time ago , who was like a student group that would like to communicate the public , what they learned in college , and they made it so much on top of street actions , and people try to explain what was called , what was hen@@ n@@ .@@ a .
and i have a lec@@ ture in my other image , up in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen at the medical museum , combin@@ ation with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion on the theme .
and that &apos;s , yeah , that &apos;s typically a young people , but the only thing that &apos;s actually done you is this fascin@@ ation in the technology .
and what you can do with it and also ask for society , so , okay , what do you know what , do you know what , do you want to engage with this , have your interest in getting with it like this ?
so , okay , so to ha@@ ck biology , you kind of need some material .
you need biological materials , and you need tools , and it &apos;s then a lab .
or instead of what you typically understand in a lab , which are sort of w@@ ur@@ ring machines , extremely expensive , extremely di@@ versi@@ ous , only for professional , trained acade@@ mi@@ cs with ph@@ .@@ d and so on .
and our approach was stop saying , okay , that you don &apos;t have to do that .
that &apos;s actually not necessary because every single phone pan@@ at is actually higher technology than most lab@@ lab equipment , that &apos;s really like that .
and s o with this pre@@ mis@@ e , for example , created brian de@@ g@@ ger in england , trying to assem@@ ble a mini@@ mal ab@@ yl@@ or , then thr@@ as@@ hed a ste@@ am of light co@@ at , a hei@@ ght pla@@ te and , yes , so conser@@ ve squ@@ ir@@ ts , and then they bre@@ ed bacteria , worked .
so anybody , who &apos;s been sent a sou@@ p once , that he has left too long even yet .
i tried this in my lab , working home a little bit , and then i started buying such a pre@@ cious hand on e@@ bay and made a little bit of d.@@ n@@ .@@ a analy@@ zing and a little bit of d.@@ n@@ .@@ a , trying to make a j@@ our@@ ni@@ stic test , so to go back to visit me .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a jo@@ ke now , but .
down here in this picture , you see the lab , in leadership , so that &apos;s such a te@@ sted garage with all of the lab de@@ br@@ is that the college has done , a group in paris that has happened , and it &apos;s pretty successful stuff , and it &apos;s doing pretty interesting things , i want to cut a project for a second .
and this is bio@@ star , which is just mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , this is , kind of , a kind of invi@@ k@@ y-@@ school , basically for molecular biology .
and yeah , you can see it &apos;s relatively he@@ ter@@ o@@ ar , so that &apos;s there by people doing it alone , up to very large organizations alone , down to large organizations that pre@@ v@@ ents more form@@ alized forms in institu@@ tional form .
but always who always makes the approach that it &apos;s just to be simple and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , o@@ .@@ k , is there as real scene here , and we are online , and we know so the people that keep it forever and keep ch@@ at@@ ting and stuff .
and then came from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ object bi@@ o or@@ g of the fo@@ under , and have said okay , we have to make real , true , real , and then we organized two events , one in london , about two thousand 10 , and soon in the united s@@ .@@ a. , in san francisco .
and , then , again , it &apos;s about , it &apos;s we , what do we want , what do we want to communicate , what do we want to communicate ?
and what are our values , and what are our target , our foundation ?
and there , we &apos;ve been equi@@ pping a co@@ st-@@ func@@ ct product gene .
it was quite intui@@ tive , so everybody just has the wi@@ sh@@ es , his and what they &apos;re holding , what it st@@ ops like , and then it says .
there was , in my opini@@ on , to a very good code .
and sure enough , we don &apos;t fit that , but that &apos;s , i think , because , well , i think it &apos;s been pretty good , people are pretty expected of this .
and we actually tried to bring back that into the acade@@ mic world , but there &apos;s kind of not going to be there .
so , i think , we &apos;re in the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ age , in terms of even one step further than the acade@@ mic world .
right , so what technology do we actually do right now ?
a project that i made with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted a so-@@ called op@@ tical tra@@ p or op@@ tical p@@ is@@ l@@ ette .
this is , if you focus a las@@ er be@@ am , on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then you move in that focus , so , it &apos;s absor@@ bed there , so it &apos;s like a tra@@ c@@ tor@@ ian be@@ am in principle .
so this really works , this is going to be done in the acade@@ mic , and we thought o@@ .@@ k , o@@ .@@ k , we can get on that , then took a web@@ c@@ am that wra@@ ps up the l@@ ens , fli@@ pping the l@@ ens , then you have a microscop@@ e that is relative to about four hundred times .
that &apos;s what you see down there .
and then we went out a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d stran@@ ner and kno@@ cked the po@@ w@@ der up the las@@ er , and then to focus on this camera .
and , unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of them .
so , another project that comes out of the french group out of paris , which has been doing , it &apos;s pretty cool .
so , that &apos;s what he had like a brain wave device , so e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g or something like this , so he runs with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
he then pl@@ ot@@ ted this hel@@ met there , and in co@@ operation with the museum that walked .
so there were the vis@@ it@@ ors going in the room , putting on this chair , putting this hel@@ met .
then your brain waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding after what they thought , and how they thought , well , they were approach@@ ed different lights in the room .
it was a pretty , very emotional project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this ad@@ oles@@ cent story , is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , which is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r display , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about repli@@ c@@ ating the genes , repli@@ cate , to repli@@ cate , to repli@@ cate , to stimu@@ late , to make it visible .
so when i do this that the pro@@ fil@@ er on the site , then , go down , colle@@ cting some ha@@ ens there , and then they do this techni@@ que , and then they can turn this techni@@ que , and then they can say , okay , this hair &apos;s speaking to this people , like that .
and the machines doing this , they &apos;re quite expensive to buy commercial , so the che@@ ap@@ est walk is so expensive at four thousand euro@@ s .
and this is not in the ho@@ b@@ by@@ space , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do very much .
so that &apos;s just one use of many that can be done with this .
and they have these two kinds of buil@@ ders here and said , o@@ .@@ o@@ k , we &apos;re doing more and che@@ aper , and we have just made open source , so free hard@@ ware , electr@@ on@@ ics , putting this one tool together , and are now the most cheap provi@@ ders to market , and are now the most che@@ ap@@ est provi@@ ders of these devices worldwide .
i think it &apos;s kind of six dollars or something like this .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s certainly in a frame where it becomes more vulnerable .
so , i think , to me , it &apos;s a very bad ha@@ ck .
a project that i recently started to do was to build a gene company .
gen@@ k store is , yes , like this kind of ar@@ ray gun that &apos;s s@@ hr@@ in@@ king around about this , two centi@@ meters or something .
you charge mu@@ n@@ .@@ a on gold particles , and the gold particles then got into these air char@@ ts , and then i sho@@ se them on the oni@@ ons , and they made light with it like this .
so the device that you see that it doesn &apos;t work .
but this is what my prototyp@@ e , which , though , would look like a third , the thing on this one , the thing on it , and open electr@@ on@@ ics , and that was too big , and that was too much the print , the thing was broken
and then i took a je@@ t pen@@ der , and i jo@@ ined it .
a hol@@ er pen@@ der , if you make the full power with water , it has enough pressure , so i think , as four as six to six times .
and so you can then speed up the particles strong enough , and then they go in the oni@@ on as well .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euro@@ s up or something , sa@@ ping around 50 euro@@ ches , or something like
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s definitely const@@ it@@ able .
so this is also right now that the core is the core of the scene to raise this avail@@ ability of technology , and also increasing the information and the understanding that more people can engage .
because , as we said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have quite little idea and not a chance to make it really well .
because , if you &apos;re just reading about it , from a classroom liter@@ acy , that &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve seen it yourself or seen it yourself .
and i think technology is going to always be important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make meaning@@ or citi@@ zen@@ le decisions in the society , and you want to talk , and then you want to talk , you need the access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it , and understand it , to understand it and understand it .
and that &apos;s then under the stre@@ e@@ ks open spac@@ es and citi@@ zen science .
so that once you get a citi@@ c , you &apos;re going to be able to counter with these kinds of scientific technologies .
and that is the core concern@@ s of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
these are the people that at least offi@@ cially took offi@@ cially on the website , i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ -@@ bio@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g
that &apos;s already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting also is that they &apos;re also repres@@ ented in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
i mean , that &apos;s there , that are there less people have less people than actually .
so i know of some that didn &apos;t absor@@ pi@@ t .
and these are just now the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , the individual people .
so in part , with these ha@@ cking identity , these places have been put together there .
and that &apos;s really where it &apos;s in the beginning .
as i said , two times it &apos;s only beginning .
and ha@@ cking , so the computer ha@@ ck@@ al@@ ity , because the c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , nin@@ e-@@ 100 hundred .
and this now has become a gigan@@ tic network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers that are repres@@ ented all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we hold ourselves in a similar way , and then we get closer and closer to , so that there are more people who can be involved .
and i would invi@@ te everybody to accept with it and even try to figure out what was going on .
it &apos;s not that simple now , but it &apos;s also not impossible if you have enough curi@@ osity and enough energy , you &apos;ll get far there .
thank you very much for listening .
so that &apos;s it .
yeah , hell@@ o .
so how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that i think very moving as designer , but also in the area of the research of the research , and most of all things in the user form .
it &apos;s about how you approach people in inter@@ active media , so they can use these inter@@ active media , and so they create an almost satis@@ fying experience .
i believe that the inter@@ active media in us arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models are add@@ it@@ ating , so that paradig@@ ms have been progra@@ mm@@ ed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can re@@ cover that right now through inter@@ active media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that this high-@@ technology technology that happens to you that pretty much power@@ es you into the future , but actually , it &apos;s that the future is right to us , in our arch@@ a@@ ic roots .
so what are evolution actually arch@@ a@@ ic models ?
i started writing four songs , and i want to explain to you brie@@ fly .
arch@@ a@@ ic cognitive models and that , these are the models that we &apos;ve en@@ counter@@ ed in the pre-@@ industrial times .
so in this arch@@ a@@ ic models , we heard that we have a gene of natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
that sounds like this is un@@ belie@@ vable , in principle .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that same thing , and i &apos;m going to prove to you about trial that you have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
the second aspe@@ ct is that since we get into this arch@@ a@@ ic models , we &apos;ve been able to talk very ast@@ on@@ ishing , though today we &apos;re going to use a co@@ di@@ fied language .
and the third sphere , which is actually expla@@ ining by itself .
we all know that the inter@@ active media is a non-@@ lin@@ ear political , which invol@@ ves lin@@ ear@@ ity , and what of course to us , of course , says that we feel the lin@@ ear@@ ity is normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information on information .
now how is this with virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove to you that one .
how many do@@ ors do the house in which you live ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them spon@@ tane@@ ously , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right
they go in the mind in this house , in whom they live , and look at how many do@@ ors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it &apos;s virtu@@ ali@@ zing the reality , without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and so we &apos;re enter@@ ing a medi@@ i cam@@ pus at the medi@@ ary cam@@ pus , so we can show virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ .@@ lab , and we can actually already do that all the time .
and this pos@@ ness to virtual the virtual reality , which they &apos;ve had the people in the pre-@@ industrial times also , because they have nothing what@@ so@@ ever .
they didn &apos;t have a books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo@@ oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
they didn &apos;t have a mass media .
the only thing that they had was their head .
and in that head , the memory was coming down .
in his head , knowledge was called , and with this virtual ima@@ gery , the imagination , also been told on knowledge .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so powerful in us that we can circum@@ vent virtu@@ ality with the virtual .
and the interesting thing is , if i have to run a little trip .
yeah . it goes .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that at this time , the human produ@@ cers and medium was available at the same time .
now , if you think about a piece of time .
today , what are the media ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has made a change .
but i &apos;ll come back to that in a minute .
now , the design tools of information process@@ ments have been known since all the stories .
sh@@ ame , p@@ rie@@ sts , p@@ rie@@ sts , called knowle@@ d@@ ges , were open-@@ ended up to protect knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re also very , very , very strong about stories .
the auth@@ or of the book the ast@@ on@@ le , jon@@ a@@ than lu@@ cker@@ on , is still running a thou@@ sand@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half hours with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories every day .
that means for a child that has spent it up to the element of the 20@@ -year-old most of his life with the reci@@ pes of stories .
now , our love for stories is depen@@ dent on that we have car@@ ried as a child on the la@@ p of our parents .
no , no , no , lo@@ ved .
it goes way back much into the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial times .
but for me , in the area of inter@@ active media , as in particular , we have focused on our biological memory , the ability to think of non-@@ lin@@ lin@@ ary , the ability to think of non@@ lin@@ lin@@ less .
i brought an example of you from the north american tri@@ be of no@@ ot@@ ca@@ -@@ na@@ ti@@ ans .
and the lives lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
and as you can see , this is a very insu@@ lt area , and you had to navi@@ gate somehow , to come from island to island to get food .
and they did it with what we call the office cards .
you may also know that , if you &apos;re interested in it , from the austr@@ ali@@ an jud@@ ants .
and they have similar principles .
they have no le@@ ad@@ al plat@@ cards , but they have used these kinds of genes , or they &apos;re using gra@@ cious son@@ gl@@ ines .
and what &apos;s interesting about it is that the navi@@ gation and to@@ po@@ graph@@ y could be recor@@ ded by regi@@ ons of regi@@ ons .
where the language was standar@@ ined by the most ener@@ ge@@ tic nation .
that is , you navi@@ g@@ ated about sound and rhyth@@ m .
and these sound and this rhyth@@ m have the ge@@ ology to repres@@ ented the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region , and that also allowed that you could de@@ com@@ press these songs and put them together and go to the left and also move to the place and also to move back to the place .
why don &apos;t we pause to get from a to b from a to b ?
anyway , not to navi@@ gate .
so what happened really ? what happens ?
it &apos;s seen as den@@ se machin@@ in@@ ary age .
we earlier migr@@ ated in what &apos;s known before the eleph@@ ant age .
it happened the machine age , and it happens to be the book , and it happens to be the phot@@ oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
and this is exactly what happens that we &apos;ve shif@@ ted the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and those of the own production of our individual memor@@ ies on ex@@ ternal media .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we &apos;re doing god a little bit off , but virtual .
virtu@@ ality has suddenly become stran@@ ser for us , and has reality with nothing more .
bru@@ ce brown , a well-@@ known design resear@@ cher at bri@@ gh@@ ton university , is so far away to say that this mass media , he &apos;s talking about the book and the internet , so not the television , the internet and so forth , what we &apos;re saying today as a mass media of our memor@@ ies , that these mass media has blo@@ cked our memor@@ ies and our ability to interact with virtu@@ alism .
let &apos;s make a little inter@@ nap@@ ar .
from the mo@@ t age to the machine age .
what has our thinking on our thinking and on our memory ?
and then the inter@@ fer@@ red forces are the pre-@@ industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to have more and more prop@@ ot@@ ted over the cent@@ u@@ ries by the machine age of machine age .
so instead , instead of re@@ minds us individu@@ ally , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , exten@@ ded , in many common patterns of memory of memor@@ ies that we can stop our personal memor@@ ies .
we no longer do it yourself .
we have an abstra@@ ct of a abstra@@ c@@ ted language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing in images that we don &apos;t introdu@@ ce things in images , but we co@@ di@@ fy you our language .
we &apos;ve been used to things that are happening lin@@ ear .
and we accep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as the law , and there are just ex@@ cep@@ tions like the non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , of example .
what succe@@ e@@ ds us is the one that rema@@ ins is the epidemic .
still , we are very , very ar@@ re@@ sted to the case as information process@@ ation very , very highly ar@@ re@@
the question is , what is now going ?
we had the vo@@ wer@@ ing age , we had the machine age , and we now respond to this so-@@ called cyber@@ -@@ age .
that sounds very spac@@ y and very well listening to sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction , i know .
but these concep@@ ts of cyber@@ age , which helps us discover these possibilities again again our ability to discover our ability
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about the non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about zero sight .
i want to explain to you a little bit about .
there are technical concep@@ ts such as aug@@ mented reality , which means the aug@@ mented reality .
so if you look at google glas@@ ses , for example , this is a concept that lets us re@@ combin@@ ing the virtual world with the real world , that means our aff@@ in@@ ity to virtual , means our aff@@ in@@ ity , the virtual than something normal , is re@@ fac@@ ed again .
another example is this so-@@ called virtual reality .
now , as crazy as that , of course , in the context of my speaking , we &apos;re moving on physi@@ cally in un@@ ites , virtual worl@@ ds , right for the model of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ cks .
and other examples of are the ambi@@ ents , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a person &apos;s re@@ act .
all of this takes the ability to accept our core ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real habit@@ at .
i &apos;ve been working in graduate , and i hope to work the video , a very , very beautiful project , this is the b@@ ach@@ el@@ i work of michael bur@@ k , an@@ it@@ ka@@ thr@@ in cr@@ ence , j@@ or@@ is sear@@ ch and jan@@ -@@ mur@@ ce g@@ arb@@ age .
and the two previous ones are also here today .
maybe you can step up for a minute , so you can pause to the two of the project with the project .
and this is a project i brought as an example , which is to be add@@ res@@ sing on this arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say about it .
so what &apos;s important to the key page , of course , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , you &apos;ll have a very likely chance that anyone can kn@@ it people in front of some con@@ dies , or that they play with the con@@ so@@ le in the hand with some con@@ so@@ le in the hand .
by all , you &apos;re doing that in your head .
so this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s true that i &apos;m explor@@ ing the outside world , so i re@@ fer to the real world .
and this game is conne@@ cting the virtual world , so the data is the data space that we produce , with the real world .
i apo@@ logi@@ ze that i have to dist@@ ingu@@ ish so much .
you can see it as much better as you can , and there &apos;s more beyond it .
and it &apos;s about identi@@ fying a city by looking at where i look at positive or robots in which places were positive or a negative .
and so i get a very different view of the city , which is a very different impres@@ sion , which is that i see deep and positive z@@ ones of a city , and it &apos;s such a different virtual map from a very different city of a very real city .
and we can now like that to look at .
ah , what you can see , exc@@ use me , is still a little explan@@ ation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world rema@@ ins in the walls of our cities , so it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of a flas@@ h@@ light , we can see these virtual worl@@ ds .
so , i would like to wra@@ p up my talk and in the sense that the characteri@@ stics and abilities that we &apos;ve ac@@ qui@@ red from the hon@@ ey age , and that caught us a little bit in the machine age that , with the help of cy@@ ber age , that that can be activ@@ ated with the use of what &apos;s called the cy@@ ber aging era , and that we can &apos;t get to this way of thinking about complex , technologi@@ cal , new products , in fact , not in the future , but actually to bring us back to our roots
thank you very much .
yeah , i &apos;m looking forward to to you to be with you .
i &apos;m just asked if this s@@ ack is a front s@@ ack , and i will be talking to you .
that &apos;s not going to do .
i &apos;ll also resol@@ ve the same thing about what &apos;s in there .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , i &apos;m going to do it a little bit curious
yes , children are fam@@ ously , or should be curious , designers as well .
i &apos;m a place from house , so , of course , i &apos;m concerned also with the theme of curi@@ osity and how it changes the curi@@ osity again , and why we might lose curi@@ osity , and we have to lose it again , and so on and so on .
that &apos;s a lot of things that you &apos;re talking about next to the actual purpose as a com@@ modi@@ ty .
if profess@@ ors are going to be curious , they &apos;re often down in such an e-@@ research se@@ mi@@ ster .
and that &apos;s also what i had in the last half of the year .
this is a research se@@ wer about natural user interface .
now , they &apos;re going to ask themselves , why do the whole designers begin to focus with such natural , arch@@ a@@ c jud@@ ging of communication , inter@@ acting and so on .
and i just like one of these little devices up , because things should be more intui@@ tive , always more natural , more controlled friend@@ ly , and you have to look at it , which is actually for human beings , which is us@@ itely friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive .
and in front of the background , i have natural living interface in the field , so the next generation in the relationship computers are concerned in the relationship of the human computer with how our tools or how the computer is changing from the computer cen@@ sor@@ s to the digital assi@@ stant .
so i &apos;ve been wor@@ rying when , of course , when is it intui@@ tive ?
maybe again , we have to look at it again .
so why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s a moment here , we &apos;re moving from the third to fourth corpo@@ rate generation or corpo@@ ra@@ tional form .
so from the modern company into the computer society .
every society is mod@@ i@@ zed by a primary medium .
at first , the tri@@ b@@ al society is through the language .
that means , you found that you &apos;ve been talking a common language , you could communicate with each other , is dra@@ wn into the same ca@@ ve , or in other parts , cities have educ@@ ated or villa@@ ges , like this , is something like a tri@@ b@@ al society .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very life@@ like .
you had to learn , because not a cell child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it copy@@ gra@@ dence and valu@@ ality of course .
that was then dis@@ rup@@ ted by the ancient society and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
now that used to be a big out@@ h@@ i , because you , of course , began to mani@@ fest the living language in form of writing , which is what flu@@ id and alive is , i &apos;m going on and i &apos;m sty@@ ning it in stone and by meas@@ uring it .
so depen@@ ding on like myself and when i &apos;m a plan@@ el , obviously , it &apos;s a very different phr@@ ase than if there &apos;s a living kind of argument .
but what happens was that the scri@@ p@@ tures appear to move into this ty@@ pe@@ qu@@ ti@@ zed as a primary medium .
then the next generation came to the united states where we actually live today .
this is just due to pressure and ti@@ pping scri@@ pt with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
at the time , it was just like a mon@@ r@@ on@@ t where a@@ del and cl@@ au@@ us and others have said , be very in@@ san@@ e when the people begins to read , the after@@ noon they want to talk to each other , and that &apos;s , of course , is completely f@@ at@@ al .
and now we get to the next generation , and the exciting thing , an evolutionary change is just every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomen@@ al phase , and we &apos;re really in this phenomen@@ al phase that we &apos;re doing things .
of course , this conf@@ its us , because we &apos;re seeing on the one hand , new media , scientific social media , facebook and so on .
with total transpar@@ ency , which is the new thinking , which is to think of the old , don &apos;t say that in the las@@ ag@@ ne horse , and no bee@@ f meat is more or other phenomen@@ a , or other phenomen@@ a , that i want to push this just , and i want to thank it to you .
and those two worl@@ ds are up up together , new and old thinking .
what &apos;s exciting about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , has been de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing very many mechanis@@ ms , and principle and arch@@ a@@ ic paradig@@ ms from from the tri@@ be society .
now , not anymore on a local level , but on a global level .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that the top@@ ic of ec@@ ology is a global .
not if i think they &apos;re lo@@ cally , and the neighb@@ or reas@@ ings less e@@ col@@ o@@ gic , then no longer works .
that , from the local village , is actually a global village has become a global village with the same principles , especially of course , experiment@@ ally intui@@ tive , but also total transpar@@ ency .
as you knew then in the village , who have who made what happens to whom and when , today , this exten@@ sion of our own self happens through this kind of mobile end@@ ings on global level .
it may be that we know glob@@ ally pus@@ hing glob@@ ally and more and more and more .
like , in the way , just pretty much happened on the village .
before the background , i just keep looking at it , which is still , what &apos;s natural for us , what &apos;s also natural to us , what have we been trying to do , but what is rational to us , so what makes the difference ?
because it &apos;s often possible people get , they can &apos;t use it so that everybody can ed@@ it with it .
so you have to engage with it , which means that , and not just it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s also going to become better .
and whenever , of course , when i can take something intui@@ tive , and how can i take a person@@ alist on it , and make things so that it &apos;s a user friend@@ ly , so that they &apos;re intui@@ tive , because then they do fun and they &apos;re simple to use .
as you &apos;re talking , even during the study , with the subject of perception and cogni@@ tion .
and that , of course , is what you started and look like , where you say , okay , now i &apos;m just looking into the inner self .
and what &apos;s going to actually look inside here ?
so how do we work when we look in there ?
and what does mean , of course , is intui@@ tively , and how does our chan@@ n@@ els of perception , and how does the cognitive process@@ ing ?
because steve jobs said that you should have a real web ask it to look at it .
so you really have to look at detail , if i want to make something finan@@ cially or intui@@ tively , what does that mean in the core .
and you can see there that you &apos;re a 30 senses , most of us think of five , now it &apos;s only seven ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges , and there are certainly seven recogni@@ zed , there &apos;s certainly the next , i &apos;m afraid , coming to our own future , and as an exten@@ sion again of our own self
and let &apos;s see , how do we take information , how do we take information on ?
by all , what is information ? what is information ?
information is every difference that is every different difference .
a lot of use the word , but at least not what it means to be detail .
but i have to understand in the heart , in the character , when it &apos;s going to be information to information , when from data , when it works from information , and from information , so i know how i can make things intui@@ tive or , of course , make mobile .
and of course , how do creation take impact on the perception .
we see this here , when i com@@ press things , then i can make them conf@@ using like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know , what &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can actually make it intui@@ tively , by showing things .
so a lot of natural , it &apos;s in a car , but i see a bit directly where &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er in there .
and when i tell someone , give me s@@ alt or pe@@ pp@@ er , he &apos;ll be able to think about the next thing , where is what it &apos;s all in .
and then on the left just intui@@ tive , and i &apos;m hop@@ ing that no sugar in there is in there that will give s@@ alt to it .
but also , our perception even , how con@@ cre@@ te as it is .
for example , this perception in the context .
the right circle looks larger than the small , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re par@@ tly the same size , and yet our awareness depen@@ ds on what context we put things in .
does anyone know what this is ?
show on on here .
so the zon@@ ing organization should still work .
there &apos;s going to be a little closer to my glas@@ ses
so it &apos;s &apos; round .
a second circle is starting to cor@@ rel@@ ate or associ@@ ate certain simil@@ ar@@ ity .
and if i hold even a hal@@ bo@@ val , then we don &apos;t have another unit , which is , again , a unit , a circle and , but we see an operation , we can &apos;t see more three parts , a circle , a circle , a different one .
this is what &apos;s called a gest@@ ure leg@@ is@@ lation or a kind of m@@ old psychology that &apos;s also influ@@ enced in perception .
and in fact , for designers , they have mostly in the first se@@ me@@ ster , the great pla@@ in laws .
sculp@@ t@@ ary law of the continu@@ ity , the son@@ ary law of the continu@@ ity and so on .
many times in the third time , they &apos;ve for@@ gotten again .
but that &apos;s a cru@@ cially important compon@@ ent , if you want to make things intui@@ tively change , simul@@ tane@@ ously .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting is what the visual is .
sounds very rural to ban@@ al , but it &apos;s really exciting when you &apos;re going to focus with it .
so we have the eyes over at the front , and now you think , we &apos;re seeing end up from right now .
that &apos;s fal@@ se .
you see the way back from the back .
that is , they pro@@ j@@ y a hin@@ t on the front that they see what they &apos;re repli@@ c@@ ating , most like circle .
that is , we just no@@ j@@ gle our vision before we see it , which brings back to back in our se@@ a@@ machine , to say , okay .
i have this cognitive re@@ ference , you have pro@@ j@@ ens , what you pro@@ j@@ y want to see .
so , that &apos;s there , that &apos;s coming back again .
and then we go back to the front , because the back at the back doesn &apos;t , and say , now look , even please again , and sure if what you see , even what you see , what also is going to see what you want
and then it &apos;s back back@@ wards , and then it &apos;s just seen it first .
so a very , very exciting process of how much things happen and what personal objects happen in these things .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s from you to know this image .
there is exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
now everybody is trying to figure out something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s recogni@@ zing .
does anybody look at something ?
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , that &apos;s right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s because a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is in there , then you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget anymore , because i &apos;ll show you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is .
now , look at the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
and keep on , you see it all the time .
that means i actually have them sho@@ ot@@ ed them now , that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns in it , but i have them in a short time , and i &apos;ve been using this dog in this very specific picture , and then seeing this dog .
and this is this proje@@ ction of vision , ta@@ pe , vision .
now , i know here , and now i pro@@ j@@ ly pro@@ of , that i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
i look at the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
so quite exciting processes , which then in this , yes , gra@@ y doesn &apos;t actually be , but here in this ro@@ ck@@ en mass is moving on .
does anyone know what three seconds are ?
, yeah , yeah .
that &apos;s our current present .
so , also , it &apos;s interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes about three seconds , i kind of can &apos;t live out of the present in the past &apos;s time , i can also also live very well a war@@ ring time in which i always do it by somebody with three seconds .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s got to trial as a present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can close very elegan@@ t moments time for example on the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what does 85 milli@@ seconds take up ?
yeah , milli@@ seconds .
also it &apos;s a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the period of time when you fall in love .
that means , asi@@ de , if you know this now , look at who you &apos;re looking like a long time , because i don &apos;t have a wea@@ pon of any of the forces for , which then can happen
and six billion seconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of most of the per@@ cep@@ tions that we have .
so , that &apos;s , that first impres@@ sion is happening in a fast fast speed , how we percei@@ ve things .
and we also see things about what we look and how we manage ourselves against our environment , so that we can think about it so pre@@ cis@@ ely .
of course , designers are not just dealing with the top@@ ical cogni@@ tion and neu@@ ral process@@ ing or cogni@@ tion@@ ari@@ ery , but of course , in the issue of human@@ -@@ to-@@ human@@ -@@ object relationship .
so , how does a human with certain things are about .
there &apos;s also product language , so the practical fun@@ ctions , so form@@ als or for@@ mal@@ es@@ es@@ tic aspe@@ cts .
there are artic@@ le-@@ based fun@@ ctions , where i know exactly where to attack , where i need to choose .
but there are symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , so why gives somebody a little pause for this , where nothing har@@ sh@@ less , so kill@@ s , so hor@@ ses , so hor@@ ses on money , even though it &apos;s not that handy ?
we &apos;re more on symbo@@ lic , on the meaning of meaning that we &apos;re facing as a m@@ old of , of course , as a m@@ old .
back to my actual theme of natural energy interface and the subject , which , of course , lies differently , is sustainable .
us@@ ability is always , how can i hold a certain goal , or how can a users in a particular use , according to effici@@ ently , effici@@ ent and satis@@ fying a goal .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on like the nor@@ m .
how can i make something that makes you useful friend@@ ly ?
can i manage this directly or i need &apos; man@@ n &apos;s man@@ ual , or i need to do some training .
and less us@@ able or cont@@ amin@@ ative is it .
i mean that i do it different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s more hand@@ le .
you have to understand it as well .
and then , part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , looking at this , you &apos;re also going to understand why 6@@ 0-@@ century math of our software today or not is useful on in@@ ks , or not being us@@ able on in@@ ks , the i@@ -@@ pad in many areas or i@@ -@@ phones , even though it &apos;s wid@@ ely more intui@@ tive than classi@@ cal software .
and tradition@@ ally , of course , intui@@ tive gene@@ bility has not only known a fundamental economic factor since apple , of element@@ ary success , if i want to make a profit to people of technologi@@ cal devices .
now why ?
because in fact , we usually dep@@ end through this new kind of ver@@ ability , which is the natural user mary , which is about five times as far on our target .
you have to imagine that , if you make something of the classi@@ cal so@@ wel@@ et , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean you can probably go home four hours worth home , but your emplo@@ yer , or someone , is telling you how he &apos;s working with the four hours .
i want to say that it &apos;s natural to us , of course , to do things as well to build things .
so if we were to take back into the real@@ m of software , here &apos;s how the first paper and gang inter@@ faces were very abstra@@ ct , where you took months to deal with these systems .
then the next ones that now , with example of ne@@ me neu@@ ral model or mental models like software e@@ er@@ gon@@ om@@ mer , have worked , you have an idea of something , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top , to make the computer able to make it able .
so no longer zer@@ o@@ es and ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but just a metaphor .
this made the whole amount of user friend@@ ly , but it &apos;s also much better , of course .
the next generation of the wikipedia user of the graphic user is working a lot more with behavior .
so , as a designers , i love a lot more frequ@@ ent than what the behavior is .
that &apos;s another paradig@@ m shift as well .
that at once , i suddenly see that that look less un@@ important to success , just the us@@ ability is going to be a ap@@ p .
and if i go back to these natural content into these natural content patterns , where i am by voice , by language , in touch , per gest@@ ure , in a gest@@ ure , and a cur@@ sor that needs to ta@@ x things , i &apos;m still quick@@ er and even immedi@@ ate .
but i get to the point again , when things are actually more intui@@ tive , when they &apos;re really more intui@@ tive ?
if you get more intui@@ tive , and then i have to el@@ ev@@ ate my little friend , and look , what does it mean from point of cognitive ser@@ gon@@ om@@ us , when is it really intui@@ tive to ask ?
and that &apos;s always intui@@ tive for us humans , if i have to think about it a little bit about it .
so , it doesn &apos;t seem to think , it doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s going to make it easy .
well , the less i think about it , the more difficult it is .
and what does this mean for the designers ?
that means , if we look at the fact that we can trans@@ fer exi@@ sting models from you on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can &apos;t gain it as a function .
that means , i can only trans@@ fer an intui@@ tive , human map model on a software , and make the software fully user friend@@ ly .
now , of course , this is the question , of course , what the tou@@ gh@@ est pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of us humans , and now i have repor@@ ted it .
this is what we call o@@ si@@ cking model .
so that use all of us and o@@ ar is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m and represents for ori@@ ent , sele@@ cting , in@@ formed , in@@ formed .
that makes each of you all the time , but it &apos;s un@@ consci@@ ously and pretty intui@@ tive , or in part , or in part , instin@@ ctive .
the model is already stre@@ t@@ ched in the wom@@ b and is inter@@ cultural , so it works in young and old , so it works in young and old , and it will use all of us , without even knowing that this model is here .
o@@ des o@@ tra@@ d@@ ral is going to ever be active to perhaps 50 to se@@ vent@@ h times of us , so on the sleep , you realize that it &apos;s going to be fewer common@@ ed than a day .
i can now celebra@@ te this mental action model , sele@@ ct , artic@@ ul@@ ating , trans@@ forming trans@@ actions on an interaction system .
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , much like the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but not another metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a act of action , but a metaphor of a gps game , an action .
and this is on a higher gra@@ ve of user friend@@ ness than the pro@@ pos@@ al of a classi@@ cal metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top .
and when i &apos;m going through this , for example , in which i am creative than over@@ sight , sele@@ cted as a choice , inst@@ all@@ ed in the stock , it comes up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , surro@@ ws is , i can throw it somewhere in detail , and hear somebody and drin@@ ks and so on .
then i can trans@@ late the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do that with one example .
everyone &apos;s already e@@ aten ca@@ es .
re@@ view : now , i sort of interact with the object , and i can sort of zo@@ om out , zo@@ om out .
i &apos;m getting the whole super@@ vision , now fil@@ ling up this way , and can tell me , show me all about cho@@ col@@ ate .
and all of a sudden , you have a interface , which is more intui@@ tive and very much more natural .
because i can throw things like the pieces , tou@@ ch , and they &apos;ll get to me , is far more natural than if on hier@@ arch@@ ical organized sites or other mechanis@@ ms , somehow , these things can make use of these things .
plan is more phot@@ us-@@ than@@ ic , and with that sentence , i want to also like to close , a and again , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in that sense thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to lead to you to a very specific aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
the first , when you become a child as a child , is that you care about what the choices you have , yeah ? and according to whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in their po@@ ckets , the more , so that they &apos;ve allowed them to play more or less in their po@@ ckets , the more , so they &apos;re attra@@ cted to .
and the curi@@ osity is not learning .
so these are all of you who are here and curious , actually people who have any characteri@@ dom@@ ium that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m here to re@@ fer to all of this environmental discussion , cap@@ ge@@ tic , 4@@ 0-@@ years clu@@ b@@ -@@ based ro@@ me , to transform in quality .
and there is a central point of it .
and that &apos;s depen@@ dent on phosp@@ hor@@ us .
cheap pe@@ e a chance .
every day , you give them chemistry to about two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and every day you have to capture two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us every day .
otherwise , they can &apos;t have any teeth .
they can &apos;t store the energy .
they can &apos;t have b@@ ones .
we could just fli@@ p as an am@@ or@@ ph@@ ere m@@ yer through the sea east .
in fact , if we don &apos;t take up phosp@@ hor@@ us , we don &apos;t capture and disc@@ uss .
what &apos;s amazing is that we &apos;re having progress here with something that would actually be self-@@ appreci@@ ation , but it &apos;s not .
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but no one is talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ h problem .
the phosp@@ hor@@ h problem is a lot of cri@@ tic@@ ical .
we dep@@ end up from two countries .
we have only been only two years of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and already by the phosp@@ hor@@ h min@@ ing glob@@ ally , with much more ur@@ ani@@ um in the environment than we &apos;re used in all atom@@ ic plants .
in the last two decades alone , there have been 15 thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ um in our fields in germany .
and we assu@@ me that all up .
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in kids .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less har@@ m@@ ful .
so , for example , ge@@ tz , the environment , go less cars .
sh@@ ri@@ tz the environment , make less waste .
sh@@ ir@@ tz the environment , consum@@ ing less energy .
but that &apos;s not an protection .
that &apos;s , as if i say i &apos;m saying , pass your child , it &apos;s three times , rather than five times .
that &apos;s just a little less de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing .
if we think about it from the stran@@ ce to the ba@@ sti@@ e , our whole earth is on@@ wards or later a ce@@ me@@ tery .
so thinking of the miner@@ als to what it looks like .
and the most important thing is watching us to look at the ground , first .
in the ground there &apos;s over six percent of the carbon stor@@ es .
right now , we &apos;re building cor@@ n , and we lose 3@@ 0-@@ and 30 kil@@ ogra@@ ms per he@@ ct@@ are of 3@@ 0-@@ tons per he@@ ct@@ are , or compu@@ ting to the square meters as well .
that is , we lose in the ground about five times more than new@@ -@@ time .
we can , of course , look at the de@@ br@@ is problem .
and it &apos;s all pac@@ k@@ aging or content .
for example , in bro@@ b@@ u , for example , the tw@@ ent@@ y of the waste has been su@@ el@@ able to wind@@
and because we &apos;re older , we &apos;re going to speed up the wind .
it &apos;s kind of all in the pre@@ ven@@ tion valley .
yes ?
one baby needs about six thousand wind@@ li@@ ves .
we could , of course , reduce about 10 percent , but what does it do ?
that &apos;s bal@@ an@@ ced in china in one second .
that &apos;s completely o@@ wes@@ ome .
so the question is , how are we going to do with these kinds of wind@@ mil@@ l ?
here , one of the evidence , by the way , is that men are not pig@@ s .
so i want to tell you .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is distribu@@ ted in the pig@@ s on the soli@@ d components of the sli@@ g .
with the people of the ur@@ ine .
ye@@ p .
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s with that .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s happened , right ?
tradition@@ ally in the environmental debate , we think in the environmental debate , we are too many in the
and if you look at the people who have lost it , if you say , this would be better , you don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not there , you &apos;re being re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ate and ho@@ sti@@ le .
and so , somebody like al gore , one of our big hero@@ es , there &apos;s nothing more important than to stabili@@ ze the human population .
in israel , you say , if you save a human life , you res@@ ort the earth .
so here it says , the more you rever@@ se , the better .
ye@@ p .
so the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the mass of the ants on the earth , ants are about four times larger than we are .
i could use ter@@ mi@@ tes , but in the united states , no one may see ter@@ mit@@ es in that far , even though they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ arian .
that means the ants wei@@ gh a lot more than we do .
and because they &apos;re physi@@ cally much tou@@ cher than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re doing some low weight , in the energy consumption , a little 7@@ 0-@@ billion billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yeah ?
and where you look at how far we &apos;re away , what we could really do , and how sad we are that we are ever on the ground , you can see that , for instance , open@@ b@@ ach has a program , you can see that for 40 years , you want to be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , right ?
you can only be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l if you haven &apos;t exist in india . yeah ?
only the only opportunity .
have you ever seen a cli@@ man@@ -@@ neu@@ tra@@ l tree ?
yes ?
one only ?
so , our whole intelligence means that we want to be ji@@ mot@@ es as a tree , right ?
yes ?
no tree is a carb@@ on-@@ neu@@ tra@@ l .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , yes , yeah ?
there &apos;s no continu@@ ous problem of trees .
there are still six billion trees in the ama@@ zon@@ asia alone .
have you heard some of them before , from the trans@@ fer of trees ?
that means all our intelligence is that we want to be ji@@ mot@@ es as a tree .
and where you see , even with something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ ct bio@@ -@@ d agriculture , don &apos;t allow that our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ s@@ m products go back .
every year , we alone lose three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us that really have to go back in circu@@ lation .
and by that , we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s on top .
that is what we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty about the earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio@@ -@@ market , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no talking to pro@@ ven pro@@ gr@@ è@@ s , and as you &apos;re all ti@@ red that allows our own ex@@ cre@@ ces to go back .
isn &apos;t that deli@@ ght@@ ful ?
that &apos;s how we go too many .
it &apos;s sec@@ ure to be less embar@@ ras@@ sed , which is an oil use .
now , where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a huge foot@@ print that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it &apos;s about the environment , the highest , not there , be there , yes ?
nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ lation , yes ?
they can have zer@@ k deter@@ gent if they &apos;re not there .
even if they were sho@@ ot@@ ing at now , they would have emis@@ sions .
so they can &apos;t solve it at all .
we can do it differently .
we can get rid of our own nutri@@ ents .
we make in brazil agriculture where we extra@@ ct nutri@@ ents re@@ cover from nutri@@
right directly , we can get nutri@@ ents back in agriculture in this way .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we take the waste away .
in china , a wor@@ ker is still hon@@ ey sle@@ eping , so , yes , yeah ?
and in our universe , we were always too du@@ m@@ b to bring back our home production .
that means , the whole western civili@@ zations story is characteri@@ zed that the city just took , but the farmers never have ga@@ ined the farmers .
that had to grow more and more , because the farmers go into the cities , and the cities kept going far away to keep their nutri@@ ents .
all of the western king@@ dom is exp@@ and@@ ing , until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re im@@ plo@@ cked .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done no@@ th@@ less civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;re always able to get back to the nutri@@ ents .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to the food in china , you &apos;re expe@@ cting for the eating that you stay ti@@ ll you &apos;re looking at the toi@@ let .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go and take the nutri@@ ents to .
they did her to eat them for dinner , not to the fuel the@@ ft .
that means , you can see on the internet , how to get rid of nutri@@ ents .
this is actually beautiful with this , if you &apos;re doing this , which is agriculture , bi@@ og@@ as , on a he@@ ct@@ are country with five thousand dollars in fa@@ vel@@ as , so a farmer is about a thou@@ sand@@ th of a hundred million dollars , and the plants are waiting to grow , chi@@ ck@@ ens and pi@@ cks and vege@@ tables and fish .
and the beauty of this is that the rate of crime in the fa@@ vel@@ as is about nin@@ less percent over 9@@ 2 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be quite poor to do .
we can support them to be good .
now that &apos;s of course high-@@ tech agriculture , but the plants carrying itself .
the side of the by@@ product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed , through the design that a farmer can just organi@@ ze it .
that is , that is to go back to crimin@@ als .
and none of these fun@@ ds , we &apos;ve built over 100 or fif@@ ty in the last two years , none of these products was ever s@@ ab@@ ot@@ ed .
you could just throw a li@@ ter al@@ port on a li@@ tter , and then the plant would be ru@@ ined for years .
don &apos;t find any .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be accu@@ rate about it .
we can support them to be good .
that is , we have to get phosp@@ hor@@ us back .
and by the way , if you want to do something out of it , write up , in germany , best of all the eff@@ ti@@ d@@ ges is in frank@@ ly@@ t .
unfortunately , they don &apos;t usually , unfortunately in the open@@ stream , but maybe they can help the je@@ wel@@ s a little bit .
because the women &apos;s facili@@ ty could get the phosp@@ hor@@ us back to phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and that has to go back .
we can see that that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s way through .
we &apos;ve been using us for three years in h@@ oll@@ and now .
the du@@ tch government has expla@@ ined , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , that &apos;s sent phosp@@ hor@@ us .
but we need that in all .
you know , there are two countries that control nearly 7@@ 0-@@ percent percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us phosp@@ hor@@ us .
there &apos;s the op@@ e@@ c a bunch of or@@ phan@@ a bus@@ hes .
that &apos;s six hundreds of countries that control 40 percent of the oil prote@@ cted supply .
and the oil will replace we can replace other energy car@@ ri@@ ers .
but the phosp@@ hor@@ us is not going to replace .
so that &apos;s not about making the exi@@ sting a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and the first thing is , i wonder what the right thing is .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in h@@ oll@@ and , of course , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in h@@ oll@@ and , the country is built on flo@@ wers .
yes ?
imagine if , for example , your wife is sad , if you &apos;ve picked them up , and you come with fif@@ ty ro@@ ses .
u@@ pli@@ c@@ ely in@@ efficient .
but , u@@ ely effective , yeah ?
or take a li@@ p ap@@ p .
a woman in germany e@@ ats about six com@@ bat of three kil@@ ogra@@ ms in her lifetime .
that &apos;s what happens
that &apos;s not even a true science , because we don &apos;t know how much away is k@@ is@@ sing .
but a li@@ p ap@@ p , even in that ill@@ um@@ ination , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but it &apos;s even effective , right ?
a lot that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s why we have resi@@ stance efficiency , but efficiency .
asking what &apos;s right ? what is the right thing ?
not to burn the th@@ ure s@@ w@@ art a little bit better and dra@@ g it up and put it in the re@@ lief plant the entire material for pi@@ vers to lose , but first to ask , how do you ja@@ ve to feed pac@@ k@@ ages ?
imagine mo@@ z@@ art more effici@@ ently .
yes ?
if i put you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tab@@ let with open fla@@ vor and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with someone , effici@@ ently ?
yes ?
that is , everything that matters in life is not to save , to avoid , to reduce .
the whole environmental debate .
we say people , oh , you don &apos;t have an environmental consciousness in the south .
no , it kno@@ cks away exactly the right , yes ?
in every location where you &apos;re going , from , yes , you &apos;re building li@@ fes@@ ways again .
but the wrong things are .
if you take away the wrong things , you have a waste problem .
in how we think about the north .
there &apos;s each foot@@ print sig@@ ned up there .
if you walk , yes , each foot@@ print destro@@ ys the floor .
because the ground is going to die the mo@@ s@@ ses and the wind , and the water was@@ hes the floor .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means that the water rema@@ ins more in the me@@ a@@ dow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large foot@@ print that becomes a we@@ t@@ land .
not gu@@ il@@ d@@ al management .
we say in germany , sustain@@ ability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you do this with your wife ?
so what do you say ?
in@@ sur@@ ity .
then i say , he@@ al reas@@ hn@@ ess , yes ?
this is now at the minim@@ um .
so don &apos;t save , sc@@ ru@@ pt , avoid .
each tr@@ ash is nutri@@ ent .
and it &apos;s a bet of , if you see in it@@ al@@ y , people throw out in the high bo@@ w like this , into the high bo@@ w , to go out of the
because , you know , it &apos;s a dre@@ aming process .
it &apos;s a form of re@@ vi@@ vi@@ ties , yeah ?
you can show me , i was there .
but with the right design , here we go .
so , for example , we developed a cru@@ m@@ b me@@ d@@ lock that &apos;s at room temperature .
they can throw them off where they go , where they stand .
in two hours , they build all over the place .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants , so they &apos;re contribu@@ ting through the bio@@ diversity to bio@@
that is , we &apos;re useful , not less har@@ m@@ ful at that .
so there are two cy@@ cles of wire .
not to be , of course , com@@ po@@ unding com@@ post@@ able .
a television or a was@@ hing machine , they just use that , they don &apos;t consu@@ me them .
just the things that are hur@@ ting , like sho@@ ot@@ ing , like pig@@ h bel@@ ings , like businesses , that have to be that they go into biological systems .
the things that are just going to be used in technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yes ?
direct adverti@@ sing , not for the company , pu@@ ma per se , but for now to help you do this business to success@@ fully make these products .
because we don &apos;t do things much free from .
yes ?
so when i invi@@ te you to the food and say , that &apos;s free of he@@ rief , and then you don &apos;t feel anything .
no , we cl@@ ari@@ fy what &apos;s in there .
a positive .
so it &apos;s not like de@@ tat@@ x .
not tox@@ ality in there .
it &apos;s all useful , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put the ca@@ val@@ age pop on the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an bot@@ le and go into biological loo@@ ses , right ?
all of it &apos;s com@@ post@@ able about it .
and if we succe@@ ed , of course , it works us , of course , for o@@ des , for ni@@ ke and mau@@ ri@@ tz and all the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
and that &apos;s half the ab@@ f@@ y@@ bs worldwide that are going to lead by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
and that &apos;s why they help with , ask for the people .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you really care about it ?
because now they &apos;re changing the head of the cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
and i &apos;m not sure if they really go extin@@ ct .
so , let me just help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s what it is .
ye@@ p .
which was just repres@@ ented .
that &apos;s what happens .
we can do things like this that , if they lose , they can tr@@ ash , they can in biological tu@@ bes .
technical cy@@ cles are also as much .
there &apos;s one for us a direct re@@ nam@@ sion system .
this is the first e@@ col@@ a pack , actually , which is made to go back in the loo@@ p .
so again , you can get things back like this in every store .
if you get to this , yeah ?
now , remember the gras@@ ses ?
if at the moment , the waste is .
these are the pu@@ ff@@ s everywhere , almost enough .
in the countries where people get to the money .
on the de@@ po@@ b@@ a , but also in the landscape , yeah ?
if we change the plasti@@ cs so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water ves@@ sel@@ s , inside , they can back on cell@@ u@@ lo@@ si@@ c base , with a baby in israel or in tun@@ isi@@ a hundred and a half thousand trees .
yes ?
just when you take these fla@@ ps , they cu@@ tter , they can c@@ ally , ster@@ ili@@ ze , and take the po@@ w@@ der to plant trees .
so the baby is hiv-@@ &apos;s energy for all of life , now from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be cli@@ man@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , we can be air@@ -@@ positive .
it &apos;s kind of a direct po@@ me drawing .
yeah , that &apos;s .
yes ?
that &apos;s something we can do .
we can re@@ tool everything again .
i fo@@ unded an institute .
mean@@ while there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they all can be ac@@ tively enga@@ ged .
there &apos;s extra ingre@@ dient to cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le , where anyone can participa@@ te .
so , no longer save , sc@@ ru@@ ba , avoid , ti@@ mber , no scho@@ ol management , but smart waste .
does she explain that curi@@ osity ?
thank you very much .
the work of the interpre@@ ts .
music is as a language .
in the descri@@ ption about my talk , that i as an interpre@@ t , i as a transl@@ ator , in english , in english , understand .
com@@ po@@ unded are con@@ fron@@ ted to the written notes in surprising music .
because as a transl@@ ator , you don &apos;t just push word word for word to another language , but also to understand the deep sense of words and spo@@ c@@ us@@ let to understand that there &apos;s a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , that knows anybody who has to do it with alien languages .
even from the ger@@ man@@ man to trans@@ late into english , you can disc@@ uss more knowledge , even if it comes to poetry , even if it &apos;s about poetry .
certainly , it &apos;s for la@@ ia , what we &apos;re doing with musi@@ cians with our music language .
as an interpre@@ t of a piece of music , i just got the cele@@ br@@ ated notes .
you think that the vot@@ es in the sound written up pretty much everything that he thought is out there .
in fact , the gra@@ des are very va@@ gue and un@@ pre@@ cis@@ ely .
these notes are about equi@@ ctly exactly or in@@ accu@@ rate , like a verb@@ al , when also very appar@@ ent , very appar@@ ent , descri@@ ption of a landscape .
because in this verb@@ al landscape , the sil@@ ence of the flo@@ wers is not to smell , the degree of the culture is only to un@@ lock , not to ignor@@ e the win@@ des , not to feel .
that is to say , interpre@@ t these really stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward myster@@ y of speech language into another , that &apos;s using audi@@ ble , con@@ cre@@ te , non-@@ verb@@ al music language .
today i want to share with you what i thought is musical , so i transl@@ ate , again , transl@@ ating into a verb@@ al language , again .
so , essentially , a trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
so i ur@@ ge you to do this whole thing rather than to do it in fi@@ er@@ ch , because if i have to trans@@ late it into english again , it would be consi@@ der@@ ably trans@@ lation to trans@@ lation .
so they work as much , the music works for me as a spo@@ ken language .
the lou@@ ded notes have the function of the letters of a ty@@ pe@@ face .
so it doesn &apos;t allow me to only learn sound and press the butt@@ ons on the piano or the right place on the piano or the right place .
that would be because of just the letters you learned to paint .
the purpose of letter you can only dete@@ ct if you can do the language .
so for that learning process , for the learning process , you need to have music language at least as long as spo@@ ken language .
there are also sur@@ ve@@ ys , whether you &apos;re learning it for your gut , or passi@@ ve understand only passi@@ ve , or you can also talk to the musical na@@ tive post@@ er .
the work of the interpre@@ t is kind of begins like a the@@ at@@ ra director .
once you first cho@@ sen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re starting to research after the creation of com@@ position .
you accu@@ mu@@ late information about the play in the se@@ gment liter@@ ature .
you read in the letters , in al choices , notes , notes , or whether there &apos;s words , thoughts of com@@ pos@@ er .
they &apos;re studying the work that he &apos;s com@@ posed before and after .
you can ex@@ tend compar@@ ison .
the mo@@ tions of writing it .
how did he feel like what he was feeling ?
what were its environments like the society and the politics like the politics ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
you &apos;re thinking in this time , by reading con@@ temporary images or liter@@ ature , or reading liter@@ ature .
but over time , you have also as interpre@@ t a ri@@ che knowledge around the com@@ pos@@ er that is played more , and it &apos;ll fall and it &apos;ll be easier to think in it and feel .
the com@@ pos@@ er is going to be more to your friend that you &apos;re living with .
his causes to write the play , it becomes more and more to my own personal concern@@ ction to play it .
so , because the notes now represents everything else as an accu@@ rate record of the com@@ pos@@ er , it &apos;s just a frame@@ work , now i now turn this sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding to satis@@ fy it with meaning and meaning .
i then tell you about my own words , what could be written between this frame@@ work .
i &apos;ll play expla@@ ining what this sound could have to mean .
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ ers at the time , and what you might mean today , and what you might mean for him today
every clay , every phr@@ ase gets a sense to it , because i percei@@ ve it myself because it re@@ ef@@ s from my current current .
it &apos;s got to be influ@@ ure for me in this and now , i don &apos;t have to convince my audience that that is my business .
it &apos;s always a very happy conc@@ ert , if i can have the experience , the play that i &apos;ve spent as long in how to re@@ live how long ago .
how you learn a happy new day again , even though always with the same ritu@@ als of life , up , get up , break@@ fast , to work , i &apos;m also going to do the same thing over and over again .
i got older a day trying to change seas@@ ons , my pul@@ ses go slo@@ wer at night than in the morning , in a conc@@ ert room , it takes longer to get the glas@@ ses back than at home .
i choose to find the audience the audi@@ tor@@ ium , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
all this is influ@@ enced me , and this is affec@@ ting my experience with com@@ position .
it &apos;s also wonderful , when i stand with a du@@ m@@ mate mate on the stage , and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
then the same thing happens as if it &apos;s in a good , well-@@ inten@@ tioned conversation .
you bring into a new idea , and what that will answer is it answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that happen to happen , and what you can &apos;t do , and which you can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience have experienced how to communicate the music lives .
so each conc@@ ert is a different con@@ cer@@ t .
i will never play more like this , like at this point .
i can &apos;t play any like this today , as in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and so i &apos;m going to move on my pal@@ ette of music sounds even more color , emotion and sen@@ sa@@ tions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to shot some paint po@@ ts also , but i &apos;m going to get some new ones .
have a nice con@@ cre@@ te example to this .
it was on a piano cur@@ su@@ s for music students at my belo@@ ved old teacher , professor je@@ wel@@ ess u@@ f , a famous be@@ tho@@ v@@ -@@ speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert bee@@ tho@@ dor@@ ist , con@@ cer@@ t@@ ated professor of music school here in stu@@ ber@@ y .
unfortunately , i was much too young , so he already was mir@@ r@@ ated when i finally started studying .
but i had the good fortun@@ e to meet it very early , with three years , to meet , and so i was on his clas@@ ses at my school .
i was se@@ vent@@ h , at the time , se@@ vent@@ h , when i was on one of his cour@@ ses and playing the last of the four hor@@ ses of ch@@ op@@ in , a day .
he asked me what the im@@ position of this bal@@ let for me was .
that &apos;s a bit of a ge@@ tra@@ l .
and in my ju@@ od@@ ness , i said , expec@@ t@@ ability .
he mil@@ ted and said , like , what ?
that &apos;s got to be the aging difference .
because for me , she &apos;s remem@@ ber@@ ing .
it was over the six@@ te@@ ent@@ h .
well , with se@@ vent@@ h , you &apos;ve got dreams still , but not great memor@@ ies .
i play the play today all the time , and always it &apos;s turned for me , even though no one audi@@ o has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i repe@@ at something new , because over and over , i read something new .
an example of this is from a very different area . mon@@ et pain@@ ted the se@@ a@@ sis j@@ mal .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in different days of day , in different light .
he transl@@ ated the ur@@ ro@@ ids far , as he saw it , as they did it , as they did at this moment .
his own personal speci@@ fication of the se@@ ac@@ ars .
the x-@@ fil@@ t interpretation of one piece of it is analog@@ able .
in now , i &apos;ve been older than ch@@ op@@ in at two-@@ 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 years when he wrote the piece .
he hasn lived only nine years .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes again , even if i mean i am able to memor@@ ize them .
to hold zi@@ gi@@ zur@@ es , right with com@@ pos@@ ers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
most of all , if he &apos;s been dead .
now , how do you begin to talk about the verb@@ als of music ?
i said , you need about it as long as spo@@ ken language tells for it .
often , music is like reading the notes that you only learn the pun@@ ch .
you learn very much first to read the word before you even talk only a word .
you learn to find the sound to the sounds on the instrument .
then , when all the fing@@ ers are in the notes and just the same way as it moves in the sound , bits comes out of sound that sound like music .
when the com@@ po@@ ver is oc@@ curr@@ ing , the students get the next per@@ forming piece .
it &apos;s har@@ dly talking about interpretation in the early trial .
all right , there &apos;s au@@ st@@ o at the front , which is a fast piece .
len@@ to , slowly .
lou@@ dly and squ@@ at@@ ches , t@@ f and b , etc , etc .
that &apos;s what most of us are here .
but even if you trans@@ late that attack , it still sta@@ ys a little bit technical .
and yet , it &apos;s not a interpretation .
i &apos;m looking at me .
i figure that you often for@@ got something very fundamental .
that is that , to make music on the instrument , you should do your musical and feel present before .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s sing@@ ing .
a kid who hasn &apos;t learned that , because it doesn &apos;t make the parents , it &apos;s going to not do it by itself either .
this is like talking to the talk .
it &apos;s necessary to have his own experience and idea of music , then on another possibility , about an instrument to take sound .
people who &apos;ve never been paying , they have never felt inst@@ antly with their own bodies , like it &apos;s to make a note .
a phr@@ ase to design with his own brea@@ thing .
the musical ori@@ entation is really the expan@@ sion of our bodies .
to sing our vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds , our hands and feet to dance .
so the ham@@ mer@@ heads in the piano are the sequ@@ el of my fing@@ ers .
the mel@@ o@@ dy ar@@ ray from the sal@@ es and the rhyth@@ m from the dance .
the final archi@@ ve no@@ wa@@ days with music isn &apos;t stimul@@ ated with music .
you don &apos;t have to have music when it gets bor@@ ed .
no longer nee@@ ds to whi@@ st@@ le or to sing a tie .
every single music is taken to re@@ cover , if you &apos;re bitten all the time with music with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i don &apos;t even sing ?
i &apos;m asking , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , b , because they don &apos;t learn to sing ?
now , between either , it &apos;s not too late to find out if you can &apos;t even find out if you can &apos;t even learn how to do these little mus@@ cles that are using the vo@@ cal regi@@ sages .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve made it to you that they &apos;re un@@ repres@@ ented .
i mean , how is it that tan@@ ce@@ ly dist@@ lic@@ able was this diagno@@ sis ?
have you gone to a two-@@ day or a third reason , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful today ?
or yeah , they don &apos;t like music , and they want to do so that they have to do so .
but what i would like to re@@ gre@@ t then is because music is a beautiful , commun@@ al thing .
but maybe , you can also make them apart .
well , you can see , for all cases , no one needs to be a flas@@ h of can@@ di@@ d@@ al .
but don &apos;t just say i don &apos;t understand , i don &apos;t understand the classi@@ cal music .
i can &apos;t tell you whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;ll answer , but sur@@ ely you can tell whether it &apos;s like or not .
because i don &apos;t believe , it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if i don &apos;t mind , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
well , they &apos;re not going to eat up on food , just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so you don &apos;t have to squ@@ ol@@ ate on classi@@ cal music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consci@@ ously and say if it ta@@ stes to you or not .
whether the music is too rop@@ ed to you or c@@ ute .
just tell what they &apos;re feeling .
and over time , you get subje@@ cts and you want some more sp@@ ices there , or you want to taste sen@@ ches even to taste .
why do i con@@ form from my audience that it &apos;s ac@@ tively listening ?
because the music is a language , and a language is for communication .
a piece of art@@ work that you never look at has no strength .
the food that has been coo@@ ked by a k@@ nee or a co@@ at e@@ al , has to be e@@ aten , and not only tra@@ ded or reci@@ pes .
so listen to when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice so@@ und@@ -@@ hand@@ ed .
if in an environment where adults make active music , or watch active music , a child gro@@ ws , it &apos;s just easy for a musical teacher , to ask , what color has your flo@@ wer ?
now , can you play them in blue now ?
and the kid plays , after a memor@@ er , instead of a red flo@@ wer before , a red flo@@ wer .
and this sounds very different than before .
so then , that was the very first one of a musical computer prin@@ ting .
so the first step to explain is to solve .
and what happens if you play a piece today , which is origin@@ ally written a hundred , or two hundred years ago , 3,000 hundred or maybe three hundred
in the mean@@ time , the instru@@ ments have evol@@ ved .
there was no piano at the time called b@@ ach yet not an olymp@@ ic .
it was just not yet been invented .
i think the stream would have been thri@@ ll@@ ed if it had had the noise opportunity of today &apos;s modern the@@ o@@ gen .
i can give the sound descri@@ ption today that the stream had , on the modern wing , to sound on the modern wing , what a b@@ aro@@ cky c@@ em@@ bal@@ o can &apos;t .
of bee@@ tho@@ ven you know that he listen@@ ed more when he was already dea@@ f .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything , which has re@@ turned an orche@@ str@@ a from then as non-@@ play@@ ful@@ ness .
so the com@@ pos@@ ers to us were respon@@ ded to us that the pieces re@@ per@@ ted to re@@ inv@@ ent .
so they &apos;re going to be listen@@ able to solving , which they have only re@@ covered in the mind .
and also , what you would think about today is in the spirit .
or what i pre@@ tend today , because what you might think you could have thought about .
thank you very much .
you know what the p@@ d is ?
have you been p@@ opti@@ n before ?
and how did that feel ?
su@@ ck .
i have a friend , who is driving a pas@@ sen@@ at@@ i .
when i get out , with my little v , p@@ es@@ el and go@@ od@@ b@@ ye , this feeling came up .
i &apos;m sho@@ ot@@ ing something through my head .
i say , o@@ f , what do you have to do a lot of car ?
that &apos;s the first year half of his style has been missing .
and indeed , you &apos;re running much less than i am .
now , why do i have to afford a little car ?
and then i &apos;ll let me know , that &apos;s not un@@ fair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice , this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling is gone .
our organis@@ m has invented a great way to just bring these kinds of aw@@ k@@ ward feelings like just going to disappe@@ ar .
they can try to also try with words like fix@@ ing or w@@ inning and something like that .
i want to explain to you today with this mechan@@ ism today or to imple@@ ment something that &apos;s un@@ know@@ able to you .
the mechan@@ ism is made out of the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lies that you may have heard you would have heard if people say , no one has the inten@@ tion to build a wall .
and then st@@ ones roll@@ ed , so he lo@@ cks sight to them .
on one such li@@ t , you can see that the li@@ ars itself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it en@@ ables you to check that it has a lot of other in mind .
he just cr@@ au@@ ps you and not themselves .
no , the lie i speak about , who has to do with it themselves .
they need this lie to preser@@ ve a life gap to preser@@ ve a self-@@ de@@ ception .
they can make them less easy , yes , re@@ exam@@ ine , or go to the ba@@ th@@ room .
you &apos;ve got to have time .
from that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that you probably may know .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so once acts a woman portra@@ me .
this woman then com@@ pla@@ ined , the portra@@ it wouldn &apos;t be seen at all .
pic@@ as@@ so ans@@ wer@@ ed , don &apos;t wait .
it &apos;ll be more as more and more .
at this point , and if you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can communicate very well .
because artists have a broken ra@@ ti@@ o to lie .
the artist shares you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see if you just look in the mirror .
the artist gives you something in one of these portra@@ it something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with if you look at this art@@ work over and over again .
then this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling , it can &apos;t see you , and it will not look as much more and harder .
so here you have this mechan@@ ism that we can use the lie as a great invention to stabili@@ ze our lifest@@ yle .
and not just in art , in the jun@@ k period , in my@@ th@@ ology , in stories , it seems back again .
you may know this idea of the lady who was looking in the mirror every morning and asked him who is , who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
and behind the seven mountains and so forth .
and they also know how much of ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty out of this life , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , jum@@ ped out of this true ex@@ teri@@ or .
but we should just be familiar with that you can &apos;t tell a woman , that there &apos;s a smar@@ ter somewhere else .
so here is what we can understand under the poli@@ ce of poli@@ ce , bringing it back again .
so , we need this lie at this time that keeping us the de@@ ception , without which we can &apos;t live to live at all .
we don &apos;t only have in art , in the fol@@ k , but also in science , such great lie .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman of the bis@@ yo@@ s of the word of mu@@ bl@@ ster .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of species and the ab@@ ge@@ sti@@ on of the man .
that the person should come from the ap@@ es and , yes , there would be a common ance@@ st@@ or between people and ap@@ es .
and then she ran her man to her husband , and she said , well , that &apos;s probably not true what charles da wri@@ tes .
people should have separ@@ ated from the mon@@ key , or have a common ance@@ st@@ or .
no , no , that &apos;s not possible .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent that people get passi@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed .
why do we prevent people &apos;s knowledge to know about something when it &apos;s true ?
because without these li@@ lies , we can &apos;t live this life hat .
because we have this self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being great , occu@@ pa@@ tion from the top of the inner , not from a kind of familiar , of something like a organis@@ m , of something as an organis@@ m that still exists , compar@@ able a stone and other kinds of things , it &apos;s un@@ sustainable for us .
so , we can &apos;t have these things at all .
we have to prevent that people know job@@ by things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly of this mechan@@ ism is cap@@ tured , and like the tra@@ ces that he &apos;s leaving , that lead to something else than this great image of ourselves , i want to ada@@ pt to you another story .
a very beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told them to tell me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she was telling me about a student .
it &apos;s an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
she li@@ kes to give him , because he has a tenden@@ cy to get to accu@@ rate .
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es ?
and he says , you know , i &apos;m with the fire@@ war .
and as i &apos;m with the fire department , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
yeah , you feel it &apos;s better at this point . there &apos;s something wrong about this spot . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said my wife , whenever a human being in moral chron@@ alization uses the words , should we try to replace it through the narra@@ cian even though we .
do that once , and then you learn the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire war , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ technical things .
you understand , that &apos;s the actual truth beyond the ex@@ ecu@@ tion .
this is a little bu@@ b that &apos;s interested in fire .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s car@@ ried for fire .
but there are no parts that we can look around where you learn how to make a fire .
there &apos;s only the second best thing that the fire war@@ ri@@ fi@@ ves .
and he sig@@ ned himself .
and ab@@ and@@ on , you don &apos;t say his teacher that you like to be ro@@ ot@@ ed somewhere , and happy when the fire comes out after@@ wards .
no , it doesn &apos;t look much better if we show that we &apos;re willing to elimin@@ ate the dan@@ ger that others tend to get when they &apos;re breaking fire .
and here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
this particular fact that in the front of the bu@@ b , in fact , he knew that he was actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t tell his word .
here you have this head@@ bridge between the un@@ conscious and the conscious , that boun@@ ces right now , without having you do something about it , and the things you know that you look very different , em@@ powered that they can sound much better for you and others .
so , that is where we just get these words in the language of political act and again in the language of the political act .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
but we know if we disc@@ uss that , the social lifest@@ yle is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t make it easy .
it &apos;s impossible to pres@@ ent like this in a society that is to be pres@@ enting .
i &apos;d like to show you now what we found in my institute .
after lo@@ gic this de@@ ception , this self-@@ de@@ ception , the will@@ ing@@ ness , another reality than the one that we actually know in the un@@ conscious , that it &apos;s val@@ id to spread out .
so this is what i want to present to you with two , maybe three examples .
the first example is to predict what many of you know and some of you esti@@ mate , and some of you don &apos;t need to have a very few .
i mean , the sou@@ l .
what is the sou@@ l ?
and the sou@@ l is such a kind of intellectual , says lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
it &apos;s something that is not dur@@ able , materi@@ ally , material nature .
and when you have people who are the most vor@@ ly convinced that you have a sou@@ l , or you can also say that they have been getting rid of the sou@@ l , then imagine that they have been re@@ covered from the sou@@ l , then imagine it as if the sou@@ l would be such a strange frame@@ work on them , not of matter , they &apos;re just from meat and blood , slightly more ste@@ ep@@ y , un@@ belie@@ ved , un@@ belie@@ vable , un@@ belie@@ vable , that &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable , it &apos;s
and from this sou@@ l , you think that , in this clou@@ dy nature , you &apos;re sort of in this evil nature , in this color@@ ful nature , my@@ a is present in the la@@ tin , the fe@@ e .
and then when this bubble is then filled about the people , it &apos;s filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with spirit , with nature that just only can live with , just with sou@@ l .
and then it can run on them .
that &apos;s the idea of how the sou@@ l works .
so she &apos;s going to want to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to percei@@ ve them as something that is necessary to be present for our lives .
and if you have this desire in looking at this , you understand the lo@@ gic that we experience to experience this lucky , through a lie of our world .
because now they can apply a three-@@ sentence .
three phr@@ ase , they &apos;re still starting to know from school .
this is now a three-@@ sentence announ@@ te that descri@@ bes us a lo@@ gic .
that &apos;s the har@@ dest part of my talk , by the way .
here , they need some lo@@ gic , but they also need to lie the will@@ ing@@ ness .
because that &apos;s to say that they can use this lo@@ gic to just exercise this lo@@ gic
in this three-@@ sentence , three sent@@ ences are coming .
the first sentence is saying , cla@@ im , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
so the second sentence is , if it &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
now there &apos;s a third phr@@ ase .
i was doing it in a particularly stand@@ place .
a third sentence , that happens immediately in people who have a strong sense of a sou@@ l .
people say who don &apos;t have a sou@@ l , who &apos;s dead , and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you &apos;re feeling it .
here comes this lo@@ gic in this , yes , in this de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing talk .
and you can see it immediately .
the first two sent@@ ences , they &apos;re logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
i can cla@@ im to all of them .
so the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make any answers about reality .
i can &apos;t say the doctor is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the doctor &apos;s lady is a man .
if i haven &apos;t right , the doctor &apos;s in the doctor is not
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make any stat@@ ement about what &apos;s going on .
i can cla@@ im it all .
but cri@@ tically , if i have right , it &apos;s just true .
so when flas@@ hing says , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
secon@@ dly , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
these things are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect .
and now we also feel our fa@@ vor of consciousness , out of it you can do something .
it makes a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences , which is that it &apos;s pre@@ defined and adop@@ ted as if the opposite of the first sentence is already pro@@ ven and pres@@ sed .
because , in fact , we have to prove if it &apos;s there the sou@@ l or not .
but with this lo@@ gic that &apos;s just using it that two sent@@ ences are rational , and a third ada@@ ge , which looks as if he &apos;s got something to do with it , so we can save our life@@ lies .
so , we pre@@ tend that it &apos;s actually impossible without being able to live a sou@@ l .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can aug@@ ment these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example that &apos;s always filled the da@@ y@@ time new@@ spa@@ pers .
this is what you have to consider another philosop@@ hi@@ cal top@@ ic , a perman@@ ent stran@@ ger from philosoph@@ y , present .
that has to do with it that we go back to the quad@@ th century .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ars that was named jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and after that , the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an called the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ an es@@ el is a s@@ el that is made of p@@ ure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have these sou@@ l .
it &apos;s such a natural thing .
and if you place the ex@@ act post in the middle between two iden@@ tical spo@@ ts , he &apos;s going to star@@ ve .
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen to what the hell is going to do first .
so , he &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s what the natural things are imag@@ ined .
fac@@ t@@ ness forces with opposite sig@@ nature sig@@ ns are recor@@ ding each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you bring another example , so if you &apos;re going to get bigger to the one mas@@ ses , he doesn &apos;t need reason , and nothing to it .
auto@@ matically , he is running to do the right idea .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re driven in nature , it &apos;s determin@@ ed by the larger ones that pul@@ t you immediately , then you quickly have the sense that there has to be something like a free thing .
and if we &apos;re on frank@@ su@@ t here in frank@@ bet , i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ h institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and he &apos;s telling him , you know , wol@@ f sing@@ er argu@@ es , there is no money in mind .
now we can again create the second sentence , and we can say that if my@@ f sing@@ er has right , he doesn &apos;t have any freedom .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal and cor@@ rect .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper almost a daily time , which you find in this third term .
it looks something like this who doesn &apos;t have any compassion , it can &apos;t inclu@@ de itself for its actions and cla@@ ims to responsibility , and therefore he is in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate .
and then you have it again .
in fact , you have to prove if there is such a thing as mer@@ ry .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to pre@@ tend to pre@@ tend that the first sentence of previous pre@@ ven@@ tion is wrong , as of , of course , the opposite without pro@@ pri@@ et@@ y .
and now you can just do something , if you want to test yourself yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , and particularly if you want to make people happy , this coura@@ ge to lie .
practice that , for example , if you meet a human being that you can say to you , there &apos;s no one more predic@@ t@@ ant .
and don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for the predi@@ ct , which is prop@@ he@@ t .
it doesn &apos;t mean to you , it would be a little bit more poli@@ tically cor@@ rect .
you say , there &apos;s no predic@@ t@@ ant .
now you &apos;re going to have one that &apos;s predi@@ ctive , experienced for the fact that there &apos;s no evidence , you can &apos;t prove that .
and sure enough , you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re bus@@ y to make sure that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no predic@@ t@@ ant , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he dec@@ ei@@ ved her .
because he has led them on a bri@@ ck@@ le that he doesn &apos;t end up in himself .
because actually this is not interesting to do this human .
it &apos;s just interested to keep yourself free to the need to prove that there &apos;s predic@@ t@@ ant .
so , in the kind of shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den , they experience the great dec@@ lar@@ ity of lying .
and once again , if you have a chance again to feel this three-@@ sentence in other people , do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember their own self-@@ ath .
i thank you for your attention .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
i was allowed to be allowed li@@ l@@ ly , could i say to them .
she &apos;s one of the ni@@ ders here of this great event , and i wonder@@ ed if i &apos;m going to give a talk here and give my idea .
i have to say , you know , you get it , it was hard to talk to me about my idea .
and i would probably like to introdu@@ ce my in@@ ch project that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum sum , a lot of ideas .
i &apos;ll probably hear , the two nice girls are there , i probably have one generation that &apos;s atta@@ ched to this bad oil painting , because i &apos;ve done nin@@ e-@@ 10@@ 0-@@ century assem@@ bly engineering to study in car@@ rot , engineering school , now she says , i don &apos;t think k@@ it .
and then i was bom@@ bing to ber@@ lin in the middle of the 19@@ 8@@ 0s , because i wanted to make rene@@ w@@ ables , and i wouldn &apos;t have been in dou@@ bt .
there was the nuclear course of le@@ o@@ pol@@ d@@ sha@@ s .
everyone at the time was also the k@@ f@@ a was also the k@@ f@@ a was called k@@ f@@ a .
the news today is project .
because a good engineer has either built fab@@ ul@@ ous cars , or atom@@ -@@ power plants .
but something do@@ o@@ fu@@ es like &apos; sol@@ al@@ le , made out of creating 100 wat@@ ts from the squ@@ ar@@ es of the clim@@ b , which was a to@@ y .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineering tool .
i &apos;m so gr@@ ate@@ ful to the pre@@ mi@@ um@@ -@@ col@@ a man that he had re@@ hab@@ ili@@ ted the word again , because after the fl@@ ush , you didn &apos;t have to use the word at all , because everything else was bad .
but in the older years , this didn &apos;t happen in the year .
it was just like that it had self-@@ manage integra@@ te , and one of them was just in cross jun@@ n@@ berg in traffic , where you would think the evil .
so , location of terror@@ ism , but that was his el@@ tr@@ on@@ ics , and it was made wind and solar power , and it &apos;s been where i started in the middle of the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
and indeed , a lot of what has been said today , i &apos;m really , because many , many beautiful effects were involved that i &apos;ve also lived through .
i worked in the colle@@ c@@ tivity for 11 years , which was base democratic .
we were tw@@ ent@@ y people .
if one didn &apos;t say was the v@@ et@@ op@@ rin@@ z@@ berg , it was completely b@@ loo@@ d@@ num@@ bing , and i spent a lot of time dou@@ bled myself , if i was maybe my great engineering college , because all my father &apos;s colleagues were always talking to him , because all my father &apos;s profess@@ ors were always talking to him , you had to break the money out of your kid in your kid .
it &apos;s famili@@ at@@ ting with fra@@ ge .
and this was really , really bit@@ ter , and you were able to get in this phase , and it was just like , you know , just in this phase , where i &apos;ve been asking myself after 10 years , thousands of mar@@ ks , that was still still , un@@ sen@@ ior , in the collective , of course , that this was supposed to be such a great thing .
and i then happen to six hundred &apos; 95 , and then i became co-@@ &apos;s fo@@ under of company sol@@ on , which became then with the sp@@ in-@@ off company of the sp@@ in-@@ off , one of the largest cell manufac@@ tors in the world .
a big history story , but also , we have the problem of a growing corpo@@ ration , and we have two chap@@ t-@@ six , a small group , decided that we &apos;re starting to get back and complete the next theme of the future , and that means that , and our idea , it &apos;s equ@@ ally crazy , that means that people say , what &apos;s the hell is , again , that people say , what &apos;s the to@@ w , they don &apos;t do anything , we talk about stor@@ es .
and then i got you a project that i want to introdu@@ ce you to now .
and the ti@@ tle of the proce@@ d@@ ure was , you get to a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and we just started asking with a relatively simple story of questions , where you could now use a memory sen@@ sation today .
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ at@@ urs .
yes , these are the data .
there are four and a half thousand people living .
today , a rene@@ w@@ able energy of fif@@ te@@ en percent have a rene@@ w@@ able energy
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have any more ?
that just doesn &apos;t go technologi@@ cal .
if you build more wind molecules each other , the system begins to fail .
i always tell the politicians to the politicians if they get to the ber@@ lin ad@@ et of our plants .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we &apos;ve only had 20 percent in germany .
but there can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we &apos;ve got seven percent in europe , and our network is physical arab@@ ologi@@ cally the european .
if we had 40 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people on this island have on this island .
the question was just , calcu@@ lation this was two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ th , the first cont@@ acts of the island started , let &apos;s just figure out .
how big would have to be because of actually like a battery so you could have such an island on 20 , 30 , 0@@ .@@ d , fif@@ ty , fif@@ ty , maybe even 7@@ 7 percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go again for another slide .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the glo@@ be .
by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ watt electrical achie@@ vement will be built to the same ex@@ act same current in the world .
that cor@@ respon@@ ds to a multi-@@ trilli@@ on-@@ power movement , because this is going to be very quick everywhere .
the energy hunger of the world that &apos;s done , is er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated with this el , because you don &apos;t need per@@ mission .
that &apos;ll go fast .
you put box around like this .
and then it &apos;s pretty much what it looks like .
in the course , three of these are waiting , two of them are waiting .
yeah , this is what it &apos;s seeing down there , it &apos;s the load .
we have very accu@@ rate data as well .
and the wind plant , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is usually a bri@@ ck system , and it &apos;s a system , which can only be stor@@ ed in small amo@@ unts here .
our goal was to make it easy , okay .
the whole pan@@ el is getting bri@@ t and the wind , the sun , is using the bur@@ den , that it can form the bigger diversity .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent rene@@ w@@ able mov@@ s , energy per year , not power per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the universe .
that is , right now , you have to make sure that rene@@ w@@ ables effectively can cost the entire net .
of course , you can only do that , of course , if you &apos;re going to be man@@ ual in some way .
that hasn &apos;t been done before in the world .
so that &apos;s in a small style , so you can also use your r@@ asi@@ ers about a little shift of inter@@ ior .
people always ask me , what do you learn in ad@@ et in ad@@ ve@@ sh@@ ard ?
that &apos;s what goes on .
but if you want to separate multiple of these shif@@ ts together and they want to build a network , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get in 7@@ 0s to 9@@ 2 percent rene@@ w@@ able , and then there &apos;s another rest , the last rest , the last 10 , 20 percent rene@@ w@@ able to it , that &apos;s going to become very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work either that you &apos;re going to do that from bat@@ ter@@ ies .
that will definitely be a source of energy that , then , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas , you can be it or c@@ it , it will be then
you have to go closer to a seas@@ onal memor@@ er and winter summer , and not just touch ge@@ ary night .
we just wanted to know what is but with a normal , stu@@ bar@@ di@@ ble , electro@@ chemical
of all , how far do you get ?
and then , a whole bunch of simu@@ lations .
and we &apos;ve combin@@ ed wind and sun and the bur@@ den , and came to the out@@ come , a very interesting out@@ come that you need for the conven@@ tional system , which takes a middle stro@@ mp of about five cents per kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour , about 4@@ 0-@@ 40 cents a kil@@ o@@ watt hour .
these were the very first calcu@@ lations that calcu@@ lations were six years ago .
and then we said , okay , .
so , here &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re che@@ aper like the same system , if the same price is ris@@ ing five percent a year .
and then we were starting to negoti@@ ate with insu@@ lan@@ ders .
what would it have to do ?
have been negoti@@ ated with inv@@ e@@ stors , i &apos;ve se@@ arch@@ ed new use of food she@@ ers .
we were only five people at the time to re@@ build one to the society .
and then again , the picture .
the brown is kind of the conven@@ tional system , the green is our system .
our system has also reach@@ ed a price , is that we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with dies@@ el , and we &apos;re also not going to push price on the other things .
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty , which is the electricity fe@@ eding company on the island , is lead , we find that very great .
and let &apos;s also want to support support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided in ber@@ lin to build a hall in which we could kind of map the electrical relationship of the island in the lar@@ sc@@ ness of one in three .
that means we &apos;ve decided to begin to find the largest bat@@ ber@@ y in the world .
so here it is .
it &apos;s naturally out of asia , in which case from japan .
and funny , it &apos;s been developed in the &apos; 7@@ 0s at b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , today , being developed , and then it was preser@@ ved to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very , very large battery .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt effect , and can bring this performance six hours long , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;ve been able to sort of get out of simul@@ ating .
and then they set them up .
we also have one of these same kinds of ag@@ gre@@ ft in the same size that it &apos;s where it says there , in the hall , to actually look at the complete dynamic behavior of this web , so in the middle it looks like this , in the back is the big battery , here &apos;s the whole stat@@ e@@ ter that we &apos;re simul@@ ating the web .
here we simu@@ late the entire trans@@ mission system , the kilometers of the c@@ able of c@@ able to kind of map the vi@@ bra@@ tional behavior in the web .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also turn two hundred kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ts of 35 kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ics on the grid .
here we see this again , again , we see the dies@@ el , again , single ag@@ gre@@ p .
and what we &apos;ve been doing , since nearly two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ th , the middle that we &apos;ve done today , is that we today have 400 ac@@ r@@ ately everything that are here between the individual system in electr@@ on@@ ics , built to software , we &apos;ve done .
so we are not a bat@@ ter@@ er manufac@@ tur@@ er , but we define ourselves as a fir@@ m that is just between the theme and the issue and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to the battery , you can communicate to the grid , and it &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that in this island , in fact , it can be all the benefits for problems that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our con@@ struc@@ tions of rene@@ w@@ ables .
so this whole discussion , where it &apos;s moving , at the moment , energy , how to go , as we should go , for example , on the island , we have 16 to 30 percent ex@@ ogen@@ ent power , so we &apos;ll bor@@ row the wind and the sun .
natural light then off@@ ers smart cor@@ an@@ e .
so sound bri@@ gs , a giant top@@ ic everywhere .
we can even start to integra@@ te electro@@ mo@@ bility in the island to question hor@@ rec@@ tly , but you can manage the load .
that is , if you &apos;re rene@@ w@@ able at 7@@ 0-@@ percent , then you can &apos;t do it without getting a stor@@ eless .
you can use with &apos; smart soli@@ d , you can use the nets , yes , that should be also , you &apos;re doing the option , but you &apos;re never going to be able to push on stor@@ es .
and that &apos;s kind of like the message .
so there are also a lot of people and looking at it , because you can see what the problem you get .
if we turn down the invasi@@ ds , you don &apos;t have this ro@@ tat@@ ing mass that causes a certain kind of at@@ titude in the web .
and our european inter@@ faces is essentially just made of l@@ oud ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of big power sta@@ tions , where the wave all over europe turn around all over europe .
we look into this grid , see the 50 her@@ tz , and if it gets to ei@@ gh@@ th com@@ ma nine com@@ ma nine , we start making a few plan@@ k , then a little sa@@ h goes into ste@@ am , then we get up up again .
and this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly spar@@ k-@@ taking .
if you hold it up at random , it takes it now .
the spi@@ die reser@@ ves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net smo@@ il .
and in the time , they can respond to others .
if you don &apos;t have that , these sp@@ inning mass , you have to replace it with your efficiency electr@@ on@@ ics and electro@@ chemistry .
and we can turn out with this big battery two milli@@ seconds with this big battery .
so you can see there , there &apos;s enormous speed possibilities .
and the message is , we have to give up these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , if we like our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so forth , if we want to get them at all .
then we have to exp@@ and our mu@@ st-@@ to-@@ web capacity on the net .
mu@@ d-@@ class just means , the power station is running to keep the frequ@@ ency .
yeah , that &apos;s a big debate at the moment , because of the coal force work , because we don &apos;t otherwise stick , or ga@@ ins , because it doesn &apos;t .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you can get rid of the capacity , the mu@@ ze@@ -@@ changing capacity , get rid of electro@@ chemical memor@@ ors online into the net .
now , there &apos;s a lot of studies that are very afraid .
and this is the kind of people who come on and look at our studies , kind of our graduate sc@@ ar@@ ce .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of , how far can you take a piece of future there .
and many discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve had over the last six years were similar than the discussion that i &apos;ve had over the last 30 years , for solar vol@@ ta@@ ics .
if it goes , sh@@ ore , child play , we &apos;re accu@@ stom@@ ed to it all , don &apos;t think about it .
we have 30 gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts today of all@@ -@@ three gi@@ ga@@ watt in germany
that &apos;s ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating .
and i just come to think that in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical ves@@ sel@@ s around the world .
just simple , that &apos;s how it &apos;s going .
there will be such a lot of contro@@ ls and argument there .
the beautiful thing is i &apos;ve experienced so much time in the last two years , that scientists are looking at my page .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million sub@@ modi@@ ties projects , so google 10@@ -@@ me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t-@@ battery now we@@ ak to the ger@@ man network .
this is going to take place in the next apri@@ l .
so , of course , you remember that there &apos;s a change there , and just from that defen@@ se to yes , to the idea , a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able is right .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , it &apos;s like an au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous system .
and so far in discus@@ sions , these spor@@ ators , who make au@@ tar@@ tics , they make au@@ tar@@ ium , they have a separate web that has nothing to do with our bon@@ ds .
but the question is , it &apos;s very simple if you make a completely independent of any dop@@ en or ur@@ ani@@ a energy that &apos;s been dri@@ ll@@ ed somewhere in the world and being turned to them , there you are an island .
then just use what &apos;s there on the sun and the wind there , where they live .
and this is kind of a little bit of our vision of a meaning@@ ful energy supply , and i &apos;m also gr@@ ate@@ ful that you said , let &apos;s use solar energy .
and so that &apos;s what we do , and we get in@@ so@@ ors , also the talk of pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , that you can again be a collective colle@@ ctive and you use solar energy , here a little bit of them .
and yeah , i just want to encoura@@ ge you , in the sense that you can be cal@@ m a little bit crazy and also a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to go .
thank you very much .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n@@ is of the los angeles times , he went through the streets one day at los angeles , did a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ pati@@ ic , ra@@ u , hom@@ eless , who played on a vi@@ o@@ lin that had only two str@@ ings .
many of you will know the story , because from ste@@ ve article , because of this , a book that was fil@@ med again with robert dow@@ ney j@@ uni@@ or as steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ony a@@ yers , the contr@@ ast of the je@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ ter who studied the je@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ ter conser@@ v@@ atory and his promis@@ ing career by his par@@ an@@ o@@ id schizophren@@ ia .
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , a sor@@ sa@@ te , and 30 years later he lived as hom@@ eless on the streets of sk@@ id row in the center of sc@@ id row in los angeles .
i re@@ com@@ men@@ d all of you to read ste@@ ves book or look at the film so you can understand not just the amazing connection that created between these two men , but also how the music was helping these connections , and how they finally were allowed the instrument , when this message allows to get the mi@@ th@@ step , na@@ than@@ iel away from the street .
i met m@@ r a@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , scan@@ ning hall .
he had just heard a dem@@ o of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth arb@@ is@@ nik , and came back to the stage to imagine me .
he was talking in a very tough and funny note about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers would never make it to the baseball world , and it &apos;s all because of the ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment of the first vi@@ ver in the last sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
we went to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which was that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in me for in@@ keeping education .
i have to mention even that na@@ than@@ iel ab@@ and@@ oned a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electro@@ sho@@ cks and th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , a trau@@ ma that followed his whole life .
as a result , it &apos;s particularly pr@@ one to these schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases for these schizophren@@ ic ph@@ ases . these are sometimes so bad , and he sta@@ ys down in the streets of sc@@ id row always kept this hor@@ ror and the follo@@ wer quality of his own mind .
and in just this ri@@ ce stage , na@@ than@@ iel was when we started in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney with our first degree in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , and he started this robert , and he had absolutely lost this rare river in his eye and was completely destro@@ yed
he was talking about invisible evidence and smo@@ ke and about how somebody wanted to po@@ ison in the sle@@ eping .
i was afraid , not a lot of , but i was afraid that i could lose him to drop into a circum@@ stances , and that i could destro@@ y him with his relationship with vi@@ o@@ lin , when i started talking about narra@@ tives and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of the di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic g@@ inger department .
so i just started to play .
i was playing the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s vi@@ o@@ lin con@@ cer@@ t .
and as i played , i noticed that in na@@ th@@ cut &apos;s eyes , there was a complete change .
it was as if it was underneath the influence of a invisible produ@@ z@@ i , a chemical reaction whose cat@@ aly@@ st was my play .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ r man@@ ish an@@ ger trans@@ formed into understanding , in a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and peace .
and like a mira@@ cle , he took his vi@@ o@@ lin , and he started to play some cli@@ ps of po@@ per con@@ cer@@ ts , and then i asked myself to play them : men@@ del@@ s@@ son , t@@ br@@ i@@ ko@@ sk@@ sk@@ i , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
we started talking about music , starting from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , ul@@ ck@@ ner and all the other bs , from bar@@ to@@ k to to es@@ a pe@@ k@@ ar sal@@ es .
and i realized that he was not just an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia knowledge about music , but also connected to it a nar@@ row personal relationship .
he was talking about her with a passion and an understanding that i otherwise knew from my collea@@ gue in los angeles of los angeles .
by played music and talking about music , from this par@@ an@@ o@@ id , con@@ cre@@ te man who had yet moved through the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ vely , educ@@ ated , exc@@ it@@ ent , in gu@@ il@@ li@@ ard trained musi@@ cians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for na@@ than@@ iel , music means si@@ ani@@ an health .
because the music allows him to transform his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions with its imagination and creativity in something real to a very real shift .
and here he es@@ cap@@ es his rup@@ tive conditions .
i understood that that &apos;s what the nature of art is .
that &apos;s why we make music : so we do something that in all of us , deep inside ourselves , our emotions , through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , can shape through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of this expression is going to reach us all , and moves , inspi@@ re and in@@ formed us .
what na@@ than@@ iel did , so the music brought it back to a community of friends .
the de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing power of music brought it back into a family of musi@@ cians who insi@@ sted him who recogni@@ zed his talent and ate it .
and i &apos;ll repe@@ at again with na@@ than@@ iel music , whether in the wal@@ t dis@@ ney , hall or sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me of why i became a musi@@ cian .
thank you very much .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i want to play something that i did , which i sto@@ le the c@@ elli@@ st .
i hope you &apos;ll for@@ give me .
so i didn &apos;t know a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two hat@@ ches .
this first one , this was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
it was a beautiful fish , che@@ am@@ able , good con@@ den@@ si@@ ven@@ ess , a lat@@ ter on the men@@ k@@ map .
something like a fish .
even better , he was gro@@ wed in a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture for the highest levels of sustain@@ ability .
so you could probably feel like to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over a couple of months .
one day , the minister of the company called and asked , if i could , with an event , i could do about the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
and i said , &quot; of course .
and here was a company trying to solve what became this un@@ impres@@ se problem for our che@@ fs , how do we keep fish on our men@@ es ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fis@@ hed the ocean as we beat the fore@@ sts of the ca@@ pe .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ r@@ y the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tun@@ a , the heal@@ ing , the la@@ p , the l@@ ush , the quie@@ t fish , they &apos;ve broken together .
it &apos;s almost nothing more left .
so , you &apos;ll enjoy vo@@ il a@@ x ac@@ ul@@ ture , fis@@ ables , fis@@ ables , part of our future .
many notes against it . fishing pollution pollu@@ ts to the environment , most of them anyway , and they are in@@ efficient , take tun@@ a . a big pre@@ fer@@ ment .
he &apos;s got a food process of 15 to one .
that is , you need 15 pounds of wild fish to get a po@@ und of tun@@ a .
not very sustainable .
taste isn &apos;t ta@@ stes .
so finally , there was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to be fund@@ ed .
on the day before the event , i called the head of public effort for the company .
we &apos;re not going to call him .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far out of the sea so far that you wouldn &apos;t be pollu@@ ted to the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far outside that the waste is distribu@@ ted by our fish , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
and then , he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
these n@@ f@@ age of 2.@@ 5 to 1 , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the business . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , that &apos;s great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one of what ? what ban@@ ges you ? &quot;
to say &quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put up .
and that night , i stood in bed , and i thought , what the hell is that a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , i called , just before the event , i called , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what , in a sustainable one , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask to ask .
well , i had to tele@@ scri@@ p@@ ted with a few people in the company , no one could give me a de@@ cent answer , and until finally , i was tele@@ telling bi@@ ologists .
we also don &apos;t call him ele@@ e .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some fish me@@ bes , and then he said , bu@@ ck@@ le p@@ el@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ u@@ en ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fri@@ gh@@ ts , skin , bone fl@@ our , sting , dry , dry and feed . &quot;
i said , &quot; what a lot of our percent &apos;s food is chicken ? &quot;
in the assu@@ mption , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long scho@@ ster in the direc@@ tion , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved about this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ cle@@ an@@ er and gu@@ en-@@ man .
i &apos;ll be even .
no , i actually am putting away from this fish , because , i swe@@ ar to god , that kno@@ cked fish after this interview to chicken .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way , the way in which you learn the better you learn your fish , you &apos;re lo@@ ving the fish .
i first e@@ aten him in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in .
a char@@ ished journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time .
basically , it &apos;s kind of s@@ wir@@ l us .
he came on the table with a bright , almost stun@@ ning white paint .
the che@@ f had co@@ ok him .
now , twice .
now , ama@@ z@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ cious .
who can taste a fish so good after he got coo@@ ked ?
i don &apos;t can , but this guy can do it .
we &apos;re going to call him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he &apos;s called mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , it doesn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and it &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least in the way you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
this is a fishing el@@ ev@@ ated in the south western corner in spa@@ in .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the fl@@ ate gu@@ ad@@ el@@ r@@ vi@@ r .
up in the 198@@ 0s , the farm in ar@@ gent@@ ina was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
they were growing bu@@ mp@@ s on what was basically we@@ t@@ lands .
they did that by de@@ fle@@ cting the land .
they built this complicated out@@ come of chan@@ n@@ els , and they car@@ ried water out of the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that stuff that it was working , not econom@@ ically .
and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , it was a disaster .
it built about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds for this place .
and in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company bought a span@@ ish company with environmental consciousness .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water rever@@ ses .
they &apos;ve literally institu@@ ted the le@@ ver .
so instead of swi@@ mming the water out , they use the chan@@ n@@ els to re@@ store the water .
they fl@@ our@@ ished the chan@@ n@@ els .
it created a 1@@ 1,000 ac@@ r@@ es of fish in -- bar@@ n , sea , gar@@ n@@ l , a@@ al -- and they have mi@@ gu@@ el , and his company is the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destruction completely .
the farm is un@@ belie@@ vable .
i mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they &apos;re star@@ ing out on the hori@@ zon that &apos;s a million miles away , and all you &apos;re seeing is covered chan@@ n@@ els , and these den@@ sity , vol@@ umin@@ ous mar@@ ch .
i wasn &apos;t there a long time ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a piece of &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to k@@ is@@ ses . &quot;
okay ? so there were , and f@@ ought us through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i cle@@ an@@ ed and swi@@ mming , and swi@@ t@@ ches to my k@@ ne@@ ch , and mi@@ gu@@ el would eat a biological lec@@ ture .
here he li@@ f@@ ts a rare gli@@ ta@@ ar .
now , he mentioned the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
and here , he sees a pattern of b@@ und@@ les that re@@ mind it to the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it turns out that mi@@ fa@@ el has spent the largest part of his career in the mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
i asked him how he got into a fish exper@@ t like this .
he said , &quot; k@@ fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t for rela@@ tions . &quot;
and then it goes and kno@@ cks into more pra@@ ins of twi@@ gs of birds and al@@ ga@@ e and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t fa@@ ke me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community was un@@ pl@@ ly , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , my but i was in love .
and my head became we@@ ak about this crazy piece of deli@@ cious fish i had at the end of the final night .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how is it that your fish is so ta@@ sty ? &quot;
and he showed up on the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , boy , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
what is the food en@@ dow@@ ment ? &quot;
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a vi@@ able system that the fish eat what they &apos;re going to eat in the wild .
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , which is what the fish transp@@ l@@ ant .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-@@ susta@@ ining .
there &apos;s not a food .
ever bell heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
i went around this site later with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that appe@@ ars to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm that i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure ? &quot;
the moment was , if a film@@ maker had cla@@ ims to change a game change .
and we surro@@ unded around the corner , and we provi@@ ded ourselves of the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of white fl@@ amin@@ gos , a literally sti@@ cky car@@ pet the eye was enough .
&quot; that &apos;s succe@@ eding , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your tu@@ bes , p@@ ink .
they &apos;re mu@@ ding . &quot;
di@@ rt ? i was u@@ tter@@ ly conf@@ used .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t you lower your fish ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent from our fish and fish eg@@ gs to the birds .
now , last year on this site , 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s today the largest and one of the most important private he@@ ating reser@@ ves all over europe .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , is not the last thing a good bird was not the last thing you want to have on a fish atta@@ ch ? &quot;
he sha@@ ved his head , no .
he said , &quot; we build exc@@ essi@@ vely , not inten@@ sive .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
so , the ro@@ cker the better the system is the better . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think about this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her animals and a farm that meas@@ ures her success on the health of her predat@@ ors .
it &apos;s a fish up , but it also got a bird reser@@ vation .
oh , by the way , this fl@@ amin@@ gos should not even be there in front of you
they were bre@@ eding in a city of 2@@ 40 miles , where the ground state is better for the nest .
you fly 2,@@ 40 miles to the farm every morning .
and they fly 1@@ 40 kilometers each ev@@ ening .
they do it because they can follow the land@@ ed white line on the high@@ way of the high@@ way .
seriously , .
i had pres@@ ented a kind of a harvard degree of penguins , so i looked to mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , fly 2@@ 40 miles up to the farm , and fly it 26 miles back up at night ?
do that make it for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me like i had just te@@ sted a song of whit@@ ney pau@@ ston .
he said , &quot; no . because you &apos;re doing it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fis@@ her@@ y , the deli@@ cious was , and i don &apos;t like fish skin , i don &apos;t like it clean , i don &apos;t like it cr@@ ying .
it &apos;s this clever , un@@ can@@ ned fla@@ vor .
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
and yet , when i tried them in south spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t push it from fish in southern spa@@ in at all
she ta@@ sted swe@@ et and in , as if you took a bi@@ te from the ocean .
i mentioned this back to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he ni@@ red .
he said , &quot; the skin is acting like a spon@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last demo@@ way before something comes into the body .
she has evolved over evolution to hand@@ le un@@ sen@@ su@@ s . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any un@@ reli@@ ance . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that descri@@ bes her success on success of their predat@@ ors .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no own fla@@ pes is power@@ less because the water flo@@ ws through this farm , because the water flo@@ ws through this farm from the river gu@@ ad@@ el@@ it@@ vi@@ r .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that are led by the ti@@ vers today to lead chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , waste of sc@@ is@@ sor@@ ing , du@@ m@@ b control dete@@ ction .
and when it f@@ ought through the system , and that disappe@@ ars , the water is clean , when it &apos;s got bitten .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s bur@@ ying the water .
so not only a farm that fe@@ e@@ ds their animals , not just a farm that resol@@ ves their success on the health of their smo@@ ke , but a farm that is literally a water up@@ bringing device , and not just for these fish , but for you and me .
because when the water is flo@@ ating out , it &apos;s going to fall in the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i choose him , and i want to do that , because this love story , like roman@@ tic , is also indi@@ p@@ ful .
you could say that they &apos;re a pres@@ cri@@ ption for the future of good food , whether we talk about bar@@ s@@ es@@ i@@ ve or meat c@@ attle
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one where food actually taste well .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not a reali@@ stic , we &apos;re enjo@@ ying . we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love market@@ er markets . we love small family businesses . we talk about regi@@ onal food . we eat bi@@ o .
and if you cla@@ im that these are things that the future security is belie@@ ving , someone gets up somewhere , and says , &quot; hey guys , i love p@@ ke fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
&quot; can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just fe@@ eding the world
a billion people are going to star@@ ve today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of cr@@ as@@ ser ine@@ quali@@ ties in the distribution , not the over@@ all production .
now , i don &apos;t like that question because it &apos;s been about the lo@@ gic of our food system the last 50 years .
feed grain to plant fe@@ e@@ ders , ch@@ est car@@ ri@@ ers to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time the agri@@ cultural industry has just said , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can it be ? &quot;
that was the matter . it was the right state . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a body in down@@ po@@ und , a manufacturing that ris@@ es fast e@@ col@@ o@@ gical capital that deli@@ vers this production .
this is not an industry , and it &apos;s not far@@ ms .
our cor@@ n@@ ard cham@@ ber is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , not because of the re@@ ck@@ less supply , but because of the limit@@ ation of resources .
not through the lat@@ est city res@@ identi@@ al and tra@@ c@@ tor@@ er , but with ferti@@ le land , not by pu@@ mp , but by fres@@ hing water , not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by forest , not by fishing bo@@ ats , but by forest , not by fishing bo@@ ats and we@@ ats , but through fish in the sea .
you want to be fe@@ eding the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ cultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
health , chemistry and machines are in o@@ ben@@ an , and it has never really produced good for food .
let &apos;s look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model instead .
that &apos;s that which re@@ turns to two billion years of emplo@@ y@@ ment .
look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mine mi@@ gu@@ el .
businesses that don &apos;t have the worl@@ ds for themselves , are ones that re@@ store instead of re@@ stor@@ ing , agriculture that can build cros@@ sive instead of only inten@@ se , farmers who are not only manufac@@ tur@@ ers , but exper@@ ti@@ ers for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts as are tou@@ sor@@ s .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better che@@ f than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ cious .
thank you .
if i want to share with you today , it &apos;s that the whole data of data that we consu@@ me is bigger than the sum of its parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ la@@ p , i want you to think about how we can use information so that we can use information so that we can use information , and we recognize trends so that the otherwise hasn &apos;t gotten visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical ster@@ ic@@ m after age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t and what i can do with pi@@ bet , that i can film after a certain death cause , we say acci@@ dents .
and then immediately , i see a different pattern that makes itself .
and that &apos;s because in the medi@@ -@@ setting here , the people are most active , and they &apos;re at the most part of the available .
we can go out one step further , and then we re-@@ organi@@ ze the data , and then we see that cy@@ cles and cancer are the usual sus@@ pe@@ cts , but not everyone .
when we go on and concerned after age , say 40 years or yo@@ unger , we look at 40 years or yo@@ unger , we see that acci@@ dents should be even the leading thing that people should worry about .
and he fin@@ ds to that , who turns on to know that this is especially in men .
so , you can see that the search of information and data in this way remin@@ ds very much on swi@@ mming in a life@@ ful information graph .
and if we can do that for re@@ brea@@ w data , why not even do this for yourself ?
so what we have here is the cover of every single spor@@ ting illu@@ ption , each of which have ever been prin@@ ted .
it &apos;s all over here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my lec@@ tures in your rooms .
with pi@@ ck@@ ts , you can get sub@@ divi@@ ded into a decade .
you can immer@@ se into a certain year .
you can jump directly to a particular ex@@ cer@@ pt .
if i look here , i look at the ath@@ le@@ tes that appear in this paper and the spor@@ ts species .
i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong dis@@ se@@ ck , so i click here where all the expen@@ ses told me that lan@@ ce arm@@ strong &apos;s been saying .
now , if i want to get a big over@@ view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the point of bi@@ kes ? &quot;
so i go back to step and look at the perspective .
now i &apos;m looking at gre@@ g le@@ mond .
and so , you get an idea of that , that if you zo@@ om on this kind of information , artic@@ ul@@ ated , si@@ cker , you zo@@ om , zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t just measure or num@@ b .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s a little bit different .
it &apos;s a little bit between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i want to do this idea a little bit further with something we can do with some crazy crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we took every single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ date and we re@@ duced it to a little sum@@ mary .
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a shor@@ t-@@ over@@ take and a symbol for the area that it comes from .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the popular english pe@@ di@@ dat@@ es .
but even in this limit@@ ing way , we can do a lot of things .
now , we get a sense of the subje@@ cts of wikipedia that are on wikipedia &apos;s most popular .
i &apos;m going to choose the government &quot; government . &quot;
now , after i &apos;ve cho@@ sen the government , i realized that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ at@@ at@@ eli@@ cs , which most of us are called &quot; people of the year &quot; are people of the year .
this is really important , because this is an insi@@ ght that doesn &apos;t have in a single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ d .
it &apos;s just recogni@@ zing if you go back and look at all of the things .
looking at one of these sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then go into the theme magazine user people of the year , and see all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are government offi@@ ci@@ als , some come from science . some , much less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my bo@@ ss , and one comes out of the music range .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o also is a ted prize w@@ inner .
so we can jump now and throw a look at all the ted w@@ inn@@ ers .
you can see , we are sur@@ fing on the web for the first time , as if it &apos;s really a network , not just from side to side , but much more abstra@@ ct .
and so i want to show you something else that might be a little surprise .
i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
pi@@ vo@@ t , these us@@ uses -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not brow@@ ser , but you can look at web pages -- and we bring this zo@@ om@@ -@@ technology to every single website like this .
so , i can go back and go back to a specific se@@ gment to a specific se@@ gment .
now that &apos;s important , because you only look at web sites in this way , to look at the whole internet course in the same way .
so , i can zo@@ om in on my own degree in a particular peri@@ meter .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demon@@ stration i &apos;ve held up to here .
and i can sort of bring all of what i &apos;ve looked at today , so i can take back .
and , when i go back a step , and look at everything , i can re@@ ar@@ range my bran@@ ch , maybe after my search past , here , i &apos;m looking at &apos; ne@@ pol@@ ti@@ stic , here by bing , or here to live lab@@ s pi@@ k@@ ts .
and from here , i can go into the side and call it back up .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again and again , and every time it makes the whole picture bigger than the sum of the dat@@ ables .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a cur@@ ve .
we &apos;re talking about the cur@@ ve of information shif@@ ts .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; sal@@ es@@ let in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and turn the internet on its head , so instead of going from one to the other , we start to be able to go from a lot of things to many things , and see patterns that otherwise rema@@ ined hidden hidden ?
if we can do that , then this one would all have a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge out of it .
and if we know knowledge , then maybe even wisdom can come from it .
i &apos;ll stop you , thank you very much .
i grew up with a pra@@ y por@@ tion of science fi@@ ction .
in my school , i went to school to school , every day an hour a rou@@ te .
and my nose always stuck in a book , a science fi@@ ction book that was initi@@ ated my thoughts into other worl@@ ds , and in nar@@ ten@@ ically , my deep in my clo@@ set , unbe@@ at@@ ter@@ ing , in@@ sa@@ gi@@ ous curi@@ osity .
this curi@@ osity also showed me that i had always , when i was not in school , across the forest of the forest , travel@@ ed and , &quot; sam@@ ples , fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ mp@@ s and po@@ cks and water water , everything began to take home under the microscop@@ e .
i was completely discipl@@ in@@ ary , you know .
it always was about trying to understand the world and turning the boundar@@ ies of what they could do .
and my love of science fi@@ ction seemed to mirror in my neighborhood , because back in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ w to the moon and explor@@ ed the deep sea .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living room with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world full of mira@@ cles that we never had before .
that probably has agre@@ ed well to the science fi@@ ction issue .
and i was an artist .
i was able to draw . i could paint .
and since it wasn &apos;t video games nor these advan@@ tages with computer gener@@ es still had the whole phot@@ ory in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
and we had to all at that time . when we could press a book as kids , we took the descri@@ ption of the auth@@ or , and announ@@ ced it on the screen in our heads .
my response to that was the drawing and image of ali@@ ens , alien worl@@ ds , robot , spac@@ ec@@ ts and all that kind of thing .
in math class , i was caught all over the teacher , as i hi@@ d , leaving text@@ book , painting back next .
creativity had to go out kind of out .
and something interesting happened . so what i was fascin@@ ated by jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ dy &apos;s shows was the idea of one of us completely un@@ known world here on our earth itself .
i &apos;m sure i would never reach a alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p . that seemed to me pretty un@@ likely .
but here was a world that i actually en@@ counter@@ ed , here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and ex@@ o@@ tic as all of the things that i &apos;ve always imag@@ ined when i read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i get to be di@@ vers .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , a hundred kilometers from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
but i wasn &apos;t allowed to dis@@ coura@@ ge from that .
i en@@ coura@@ red my father , until finally he had a di@@ che school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right on the other side of the bor@@ der where we lived .
i made my di@@ ve in a pool of y@@ m@@ ca in the winter winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
the ocean but , a real ocean , i got to the face two years later , when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years , which are now pun@@ ished , i &apos;ve spent about 75 hours under@@ water , 500 hours of it in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so rich in a fascinating life , as we can really imagine it .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know li@@ li@@ li@@ des , unlike our own , sound human imagination .
until today , i feel stron@@ g@@ ly a@@ we of what i see on my di@@ ve .
and my love to the ocean is holding with the same inten@@ sity as the true and ever .
so , when i looked at a prof@@ ession as an adult , it was film .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner stories to tell stories , with my need , to create images .
as a child , i was constantly drawing com@@ ic books and so forth .
so movies were the path to bring pictures and stories , and the fit together .
of course , the stories i &apos;ve been looking at from the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction site : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
so in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i could link my pre@@ ference to the under@@ water world , and to interface with the film@@ -@@ making .
so , basically my two passi@@ ons are conver@@ ted .
one interesting happened happened in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this film -- and that &apos;s how we had to create a kind of liquid water cre@@ ature -- we were going to get on computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
what came out was the first computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated software sur@@ v figure that ever was seen in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t have money , and in fact , he played his production cost , but i realized something amazing : the audience in the world was as hun@@ ting as hun@@ ts of the magic that got out of it .
according to ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law , fam@@ ously , advanced technology and magic can no longer dist@@ ingu@@ ish from each other .
so , they saw something ma@@ gical .
and i discovered that really exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s got to be applied to the movie . &quot;
so we went to &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which is my next film , much more .
together with atta@@ ch@@ ment , we created the guy from liquid metal there . the success was on how this paradig@@ m would come .
and it worked . again , we had something ma@@ gical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve already played a little bit more money with the film .
so , from these two facts , a whole new world achie@@ ved , a whole new world of creativity for film end .
so i started a company , along with my good friend ken win@@ ston , who was the best ma@@ ke up@@ and and cre@@ at@@ ing designer , and it was called digital do@@ main .
the basic idea of this fir@@ m was to ski@@ p the phase of the ti@@ me@@ -@@ prin@@ ting processes with visual pr@@ inter@@ s , and start to start with digital production .
so , we did , and we managed to get a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
but in the mid@@ - &apos; 9@@ 0s , we realized that we were in the cre@@ w and the piano design -- which we actually started businesses -- to slowly get there , to slowly .
i had written this piece of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; that should look at the measure of visual effects and computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects across new si@@ ghts , with reali@@ stic human characters that were made by c@@ g , and the main characters should be all c@@ g . and the world should be all c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g .
but the cat@@ sha@@ ke stru@@ ck back very much , and the people in my company told me that we were not able to create pre@@ fa@@ in@@ acy .
so i trans@@ formed this and i made this other film about the big ship , which is running asi@@ de .
i sold this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t on a ship , &quot; and it became a love film epi@@ c , a love film epi@@ c , a
but in secret , i really wanted to turn down the real w@@ est of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know it , but it didn
but i convinced them , i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to the w@@ ck . we &apos;re going to filter the real w@@ ck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
this is hu@@ gely important . it &apos;s a good treat for marketing . &quot;
and i per@@ su@@ aded them to fund an expedi@@ tion .
sounds crazy . but this is coming back again that your imagination can create a reality .
we then created a reality six months later a reality i found in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , four kilometers under the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , and i looked at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a bu@@ ll@@ eye eye .
that was not a movie , no h@@ d , that was real .
so , that really swi@@ t@@ ched me up .
and the chance of prepar@@ ing it was enor@@ m@@ ously , we had to have c@@ ameras and cloud and cloud and all kinds of things
and i noticed how much these deep se@@ ds , in a space mission , noticed .
well , they were also highly tech and willing to take bigger planning .
you go into these cap@@ su@@ les , then you flo@@ at in these dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment , where there &apos;s no hope for res@@ cu@@ e , if you don &apos;t create it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i &apos;m in a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was absolutely obs@@ essed with explor@@ ing the deep se@@ as .
however , the part that have to do with curi@@ osity and science . it was all . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ t@@ arian . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i could not give hollywood to hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature that we could design for then a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the window .
for some of the following expedi@@ tions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in ther@@ mal@@ -@@ sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that have never seen before , and scientists who are at the time when we saw them , hasn &apos;t found a word even no words .
so , that &apos;s what changed me , and i wanted more .
and so i came up with a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want my time job as film@@ makers in hollywood to ice , and be going for a very ful@@ l-@@ time investi@@ gation . &quot;
and then we started to &quot; bis@@ mar@@ ck , &quot; and they analy@@ zed them with robo@@ tic sophisti@@ cations .
we went back to the w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
we took little robots that we built that dist@@ ingu@@ ished a fi@@ ber@@ glass c@@ able .
our inten@@ tion was to sit in and see the inside of the ship , which never had been done before .
no one ever had to study the inside of the le@@ ck . you didn &apos;t have any tools for it . so we designed the technology .
well , here i am , on the de@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and i see plan@@ s that are quite similar to these gates here , and where i know that once the band was playing there .
and i &apos;m going to fly a little robo@@ tic thing through the bro@@ cks of the ship .
i actually only , by it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;d be physi@@ cally in the ship of the ti@@ tan@@ ic of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
that was the most sur@@ real form of a d@@ é@@ j@@ em vi@@ u that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i ring around a corner , i knew what had been going to show up in the light c@@ ill of the vehicle , because i had travel@@ ed over@@ night on film on film , when we turned the film .
and the rou@@ te was an accu@@ rate copy of the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
so this was a rather aw@@ k@@ ward experience .
and she remin@@ ded me of this tele@@ pres@@ ence experience that you use such robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ ars , and so you can use your consciousness in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
it was really enor@@ m@@ ously profound .
and perhaps a little bit about what may happen in a few decades , when you have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies to explore something or do other things in all different post-@@ entrepr@@ ory refer@@ ences to investi@@ gate or do other things in all different entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ es that i can think of as a science fi@@ ction .
so after these expedi@@ tions , we started to learn what we had seen down there , to learn really , for example , these deep@@ sea properties , where we saw these incredible animals . these are sort of ali@@ ens , but here &apos;s where the her@@ s are .
they are living with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
it doesn &apos;t exist in an open-@@ light system , how we do that .
so this is what you see animals right next to a 500 degree centi@@ grade , &quot; that they can survive there .
while i was interested in the same time , i was also very interested in space science , and that was again the science fi@@ ction impact from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the space that was interested in the space and talking to nasa in the nasa min@@ d@@ set , sit down and plan in the nasa min@@ d-@@ to-@@ russi@@ the world . they drive to russi@@ a , through the mission of the bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ co@@ l , all the way up and down , fly to the global space station and take our 3d camera shel@@ ters .
so this was fascinating .
but in the end , it was out that i took space scientists with us in the deep sea .
i took them back and forth them to the world below : astro@@ bi@@ ologists , computer scientist , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources so they were looking around , and they could take sam@@ ples and they could test instru@@ ments , and so on .
we twi@@ sted docum@@ ent@@ ary repor@@ ts , but we actually did science , frank@@ ly , space science .
so the circle between my existence as science fi@@ ction was te@@ sted as a science fi@@ ction , then as a child , and the imple@@ ment@@ ation in reality .
in the course of this exploration , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i certainly think that , if you think of a director , you have to be able to have a leader like a ship cap@@ it@@ arian or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership , before i enter@@ ed these expedi@@ tions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going to get out ? &quot;
these sil@@ red videos don &apos;t let us serve money .
we &apos;re currently going to play in the cost of manufacturing . we &apos;re not a lan@@ ce .
everybody thinks i was between ti@@ tan@@ ic and a@@ vat@@ ar , and i would have walked away , somewhere else on a to@@ we@@ l on a small grain .
i &apos;ve made all these films , these docum@@ ent@@ ary films , for a very small audience .
no rest , no hon@@ it , no money . what do you just do ?
you &apos;re going to do it about the task to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the challen@@ ging environment that you have . you make it the discovery of discovery for , and because of the curious connection that comes from people when a small group of people forming a team .
because we &apos;ve made all this working with only 10 to 12 people that worked un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted for years , and sometimes we were two to three months behind each other on la@@ kes .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the a@@ version that you have in front of each other , because you have ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion a task that you can &apos;t explain to you .
when you come back to the country and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fi@@ ber glass , the wr@@ ath of the brilli@@ ance , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of human power , when you work on the ocean , &quot; you can &apos;t just explain it . it &apos;s like poli@@ ce@@ men or soldiers who have gone through and know it . this is like poli@@ ce@@ men or soldiers who &apos;ve gone through something , and know that they can &apos;t explain somebody .
there is a connection , a fe@@ asi@@ ble respect .
so when i got back to make my next film &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply to the same leadership style , that you respect your team and you were responsible in the imple@@ ment of respect .
that became really changed the dynam@@ ics .
so , there i was with a small team on un@@ known ter@@ rain , and we turned &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; with a new techni@@ que that had been not there before .
it &apos;s incredibly exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we were getting into a 4@@ 0-@@ a-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years to a real family .
so my way to make movies changed , is completely .
there were people who said that we had really done these oceans , and we were really well fund@@ ing these oceans and transpor@@ ted p@@ and@@ or@@ a .
for me , it was more of a more important way to do my job , the actual process that changed the out@@ come .
so , what can we conclu@@ de from all that ?
what kind of lessons have we learned ?
i think the first point is curi@@ tat@@ ing .
it &apos;s the most powerful human fe@@ ature .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the team of your team is more important than all of the l@@ or@@ es of the world .
if i come to my young film@@ makers who say , &quot; give me a gr@@ ence like this , &quot; like i can do something . &quot;
and i say , &quot; limit@@ er you can &apos;t hold you .
they have others for you . don &apos;t get you yourself , don &apos;t bet yourself against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; fail@@ ing is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , and explor@@ ing an alternative , it needs to be an alterna@@ te , because there &apos;s a tru@@ st@@ es@@ let .
no important a@@ im@@ ing that requi@@ red innovation , was without ever ris@@ k-@@ driven .
you have to be willing to take these risks on .
that &apos;s the idea that i like to give you to you : fail@@ ing is an alternative , but it &apos;s not an alternative , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this is surprising perhaps because my ful@@ l-@@ time job in the foundation basically revol@@ s around vac@@ cin@@ es and sa@@ ws to make the things that we inv@@ ent and deliver to the poor@@ est two billion billion a better life .
but energy and climate are hu@@ gely important for these people , pre@@ cis@@ ely more important than any other on the planet .
climate j@@ ur@@ ul@@ tion means that their se@@ ats will not grow over many years . it &apos;s too much rain or too little rain . the things are going to change the way that they can &apos;t keep their fra@@ gi@@ le environment .
this is going to star@@ vation . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to rest .
so , going a climate change is going to be horri@@ ble for you .
also , energy state is very important for them .
in fact , if you could only stop it from one thing , poverty redu@@ ction would be energy at least more effective in most of the most effective .
well , the energy admini@@ strat@@ ist is be@@ aten over time .
in fact , the continu@@ ity society is based on energy progress .
the co@@ her@@ ent evolution is trans@@ forming the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a ra@@ pid case in electrical risk , and so we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , condi@@ tion@@ ies , we can make modern materials and so many things do .
so we &apos;re in a nai@@ vely situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price -- let &apos;s get on a new bar@@ rier , and this bar@@ rier depen@@ ds with co2 .
co2 war@@ ps the planet , and the equ@@ ation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they give the extra co2 that &apos;s carrying to temperature , and these temperature increase has some very negative consequences , and effects on the weather and maybe worse , the indi@@ rect consequences that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t fit to custom@@ ize change and so to collapse whole systems .
now , the ex@@ act same movement between a carbon rise rise , and this is where it extra@@ cts temperature shift , and where their addi@@ tional consequences are , there are some counter@@ -@@ resour@@ di@@ ents , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ir@@ ration@@ y about how bad they &apos;re going to follow , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
so i asked the top scientist several times , &quot; do we really have to get down to zero ?
doesn &apos;t half a quar@@ ter or a quar@@ ter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get near zero , the temperature will continue to acceler@@ ate .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s unlike say , we have a 3@@ 0-@@ foot tru@@ ck that has to be under a three-@@ meter ri@@ ck that has to be under a three-@@ meter bridge , and you can s@@ wal@@ low that particular with it .
this has to go down right down there , to zero .
well , we &apos;re laun@@ ching a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american one : about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to extra@@ ct change that &apos;s pul@@ ling down at zero .
it &apos;s been materi@@ ally moved .
only different economic changes have been affec@@ ted it , and we have to move from rapi@@ dly to reduce the increase , and a redu@@ ction down to zero .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors . a little bit multi@@ pli@@ cation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to bring down zero , from the number of people that each human use on average , the average energy for any human energy and the co2 , which is em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit .
so let &apos;s look at each and every person and think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to get very close to zero .
now that &apos;s the basic al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the popu@@ lations .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people live .
and it goes to about nine billion . they go to 9 billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care and transpor@@ tation , we could reduce that by 10 percent to 15 percent , but right now , we see a slo@@ pe by 1.@@ 3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that inclu@@ des everything that we eat , clo@@ thing , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
these are very good things and in@@ fusion redu@@ ction is to make these services almost available on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number gets ris@@ ed .
in the rich world , in the upp@@ er billion , we could probably get ob@@ sc@@ ure and less use , but on average , this number will reach every year , and so on , that number will reach every year , the number of services that will be ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed to per person .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there home at home so you can read the home@@ work ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out , and they read their scho@@ ol@@ work under the street .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there are good news at all .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different practic@@ es in the light sector , through other green@@ hab@@ yp@@ es , through new metho@@ ds in houses , there are lots of services whose energy const@@ it@@ ution is down 90 percent of the nutri@@ tional supply .
in other services , like the addition of ferti@@ li@@ z@@ ers , 10@@ 5 cent@@ r@@ es : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- it suggests ; it suggests ; 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or the air or air traffic , the circu@@ it of impro@@ vement is a lot smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , maybe we can reduce a factor three or maybe even a factor 6 or maybe even a factor of six .
but with the first three fac@@ tors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to perhaps the most accu@@ rate 13 tons , and that &apos;s not just out of it !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit .
it rais@@ es the question if you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufac@@ ture of manufacturing for electricity today em@@ power@@ s co2 , except rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear energy .
so , what we have to do in a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy appe@@ ar@@ ance .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the personal p@@ c is a mira@@ cle .
the internet and ow@@ ner@@ ship is a mira@@ cle .
the people here have contribu@@ ted to the activi@@ ties of many of these tex@@ ts .
usually , there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a certain dat@@ um .
usually you just stand straight and some others get , some don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to give full gas and a mira@@ cle in a very short time .
now , i wonder@@ ed , how can i really get this pun@@ k ?
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that co@@ vers the idea of people here ?
i remem@@ ber@@ ed my year last year when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people like that .
the idea has been really tan@@ gi@@ ble for them , you know that there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
for energy , this was what i sett@@ led on .
i decided that the ligh@@ t@@ ning of light would be my this year-old contribu@@ tion to the environment here .
so here are some natural holes of light .
i &apos;ve assu@@ red that they don &apos;t bi@@ te . in fact , they probably won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all sorts of play solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t take a lot .
we need solutions , either one or more that have an uni@@ qu@@ ely abstra@@ ction and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able reli@@ ability , and even though there are lots of direc@@ tions that people are looking for for , i really only see five that can afford these big dem@@ ands .
i have cho@@ sen ti@@ ght , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
now , there might be a math contribu@@ tion , and if you expect better than i expect , than i expect , that would be great , but my core point here is that we have to work on all five of the five , and we can &apos;t give up because they &apos;re sus@@ ham@@ ed , because everyone has significant problems .
let &apos;s look at this first burning of fossil fu@@ els , sel@@ ale from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there might be simple seems , but that &apos;s it . you have to , you don &apos;t have to catch all the co2 that comes out of the box of the ch@@ ore , catch it with pressure , and then somewhere that will stay there .
there are a few pil@@ es that are creating this on a 60 percent , 80 percent standards , but it &apos;s getting 100 percent very difficult . and to get it to 100 percent is very difficult . but the biggest problem here is the cham@@ pi@@ time of the co2 , but the biggest problem here is the bor@@ der question .
who is going to en@@ sure it ?
who can guar@@ an@@ tee , what are literally many billion times bigger than any kind of waste you can imagine from any of the nuclear things of today ?
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ mes .
so this is a tough n@@ arb@@ ar .
next one : nuclear energy .
also , they have three big problems , and the cost , especially in ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated countries , is high , the question is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human interaction , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
so , three very hard problems that may be solu@@ ble , and which you should work on this .
the last three of the five i have sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed .
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ ables of rene@@ w@@ ables , as they &apos;re often called .
and they also have that -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some slo@@ ps .
one is the energy im@@ pac@@ ts that make these technologies dra@@ matically lower than the power plants .
this is the power ground , you &apos;re talking about a lot of square kilometers , 1,000 times more surface than a normal power station .
and also , these sources under@@ fall these sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t always turn the wind .
so , you have to , if you &apos;re depen@@ dent on these available sources , have a way , the energy , the energy even when it &apos;s not available available .
so there &apos;s great innovation . there &apos;s challenges of trans@@ mission , where , for example , if we say that the energy source is out in the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they need to also compe@@ te that the energy comes from where different comes from .
and there &apos;s the office problem .
and in order to show the dimension , i have all kinds of bat@@ ter@@ ies that are made , looking at this for automo@@ bil@@ es , computers , cell phones , flas@@ h@@ lights , for everything . and this is what i have with the amount of electr@@ onic energy that &apos;s using the world , and i found that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies that we &apos;re producing now , less than 10 minutes of the sum energy might be .
so we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approach at the time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these intern@@ al sources about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to pay about 100 percent , you need a fab@@ ul@@ ous beautiful battery .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
a chicago project ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need are a lot of companies to work on it . hundreds of them .
in every five parts of these five sur@@ faces , we need at least 100 people .
by many , they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think there are a lot of people here in the ted group who already are involved there .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among other companies , one named es@@ ol@@ ar has the great solar ther@@ mal@@ mal@@ technologies .
vin@@ berg k@@ ho@@ s@@ lin invest@@ es in do@@ zens companies the hil@@ es and intri@@ gu@@ es have the great things , and i try to support this .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i are fund@@ ing a company who , maybe surpris@@ ingly , pur@@ ses the nuclear approach .
there are a lot of innovation in the nuclear section ; mod@@ ular , liquid .
the process has stopped in this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concep@@ ts change around .
the ter@@ ra@@ tional concept , if you were part of ur@@ ans , the one percent , the north 3@@ 2@@ 3@@ 0s , we decided to burn the 99 percent , that &apos;s u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this for a long time , but you could never fully simu@@ late whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern super@@ computers , you can simu@@ late it , and see that yes . with the right way , it looks like it &apos;s func@@ tion@@ ing .
and because you burn this 99 percent , the cost profi@@ le is way a lot better .
in fact , you burn the g@@ arb@@ age , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s re@@ lief as a source of fuel .
rather than break your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
ur@@ ani@@ an is consum@@ ed gradu@@ ally , a little bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of a colum@@ n , often as &quot; migr@@ ant wave re@@ actor . &quot;
that really is the fu@@ el@@ ing problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the bit that &apos;s bur@@ ned today , so it &apos;s extra@@ cted to a light ur@@ ani@@ um .
it &apos;s the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you color@@ fully paint ocean water and just fil@@ ten , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of a lot of hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s start to think about how we measure our success .
what should our artificial appe@@ ar@@ ance look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the target that we have to get to , and then we talk about the conversation .
many are talking about an 80 percent redu@@ ction by 20@@ 50 .
it &apos;s really , really important that we get there .
the rest of them are going to be produced in poor countries , and they &apos;re still a little bit of agriculture , hopefully air@@ cal@@ ing is going to be clean and s@@ las@@ h to at the time .
so , to completely achieve this 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , they completely change their electricity generation .
the other note would tell whether we &apos;re taking the zer@@ o-@@ dollar emissions , whether it &apos;s built in all the developed world , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s good importance .
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this idea .
if we go back from there , how would the 20@@ 20 ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m look like ?
it should con@@ tain the two elements again .
we should use the speci@@ fication action to bring redu@@ ction on the path . the less we em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze , the lower it will be the carbon sum and so also the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we are companies that are not giving us are all about the major redu@@ ctions , just iden@@ zing , or even slightly less important than the other that represents the rapi@@ sity of innovation for this break@@ through .
these head@@ lines have to follow full gas , and that &apos;s what we can measure : in business numbers , in spor@@ ting and regu@@ lation changes .
there are a lot of great books on this top@@ ic .
the al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ y &apos;s &quot; sustainable energy is the hot air . &quot;
they &apos;re really going through it and creating a frame where this can be discus@@ sed , because we need support of all the pages .
there are a lot of things that need to get together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
if you were just lo@@ ving me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is hal@@ f-@@ pi@@ sted energy avail@@ age without co2 . that &apos;s what i want to do .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t feed this wish , the sei@@ zur@@ e will be terrible and shor@@ t-@@ term people are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich dep@@ th , and almost all of the lives of those two are going to be very bad .
so , what do we have to do ?
what are i doing for action ?
we have to use for more research fun@@ ds .
if countries hit cop@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen in places like cop@@ el@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should disc@@ uss this innovation strategy , and they would be sho@@ cked by the ridi@@ cul@@ ous attra@@ ctions that are consum@@ ed for these innova@@ tive approach@@ es .
we need market sor@@ ses , co2 mot@@ s , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; paint : something that creates a price signal .
we have to spread the message .
we have to have dialo@@ gue and more sophisti@@ cated and also the things that are being taken by government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ ci@@ ty a little bit better -- first , can you give us an idea of the order of magni@@ tude of this investment ?
bill gates : to operate the simulation on a super@@ computer , to get all the big scientists what we &apos;ve done , we need some 10 million . and even if we test our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure it &apos;s reas@@ on@@ able , you can only be in the 10@@ 0@@ 0,000 million .
the hard step is built the first respon@@ sor of the first re@@ actor to find other billion , the regul@@ ari@@ os and the place that actually create the first of them .
once the first thing is done , if it pas@@ ses like pres@@ ent@@ y , it &apos;s very obvious , because the economic , the energy , is so different than nuclear energy , as we know it .
to understand that right , that does mean deep in the ground almost like a ver@@ tical cu@@ be of nuclear fu@@ els , that consum@@ ing ur@@ ans , and then does the process up , and then continue down ?
b@@ g : right . so today you have to re@@ pair the re@@ actor , so there are a lot of people and a lot of contro@@ ls that can go wrong -- this thing where you can open it and stuff in it -- it &apos;s not good !
if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think of a colum@@ n -- that you bu@@ ried , without all the intri@@ c@@ acy of the whole complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s burning for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear re@@ actor that off@@ ers itself a solution to the g@@ arb@@ age .
b@@ g : yeah . now what happens to the waste : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less g@@ arb@@ age with this method -- you take it and you put it in the next re@@ actor and burn it .
and we &apos;re starting , by taking the g@@ arb@@ age that already exists in these re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators or dr@@ ases in the re@@ ac@@ tors . this is our time fuel .
so this re@@ ac@@ tors is a problem of what we &apos;re pus@@ hing into , what we put in our fil@@ ness , dra@@ matically redu@@ ction the waste acceler@@ ation during this process .
but while they &apos;ve talked to various people in the world , they &apos;ve been talking about these possibilities .
where is the greatest interest of this really to do this ?
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t ri@@ pped into a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting evidence for everything called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s a lot of interest , and the people of the corpo@@ ration were in russi@@ a , india , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve met the energy agen@@ cy and talked about how it works to the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese made something in the direction .
this is a vari@@ ant of one thing that was done .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor , and some countries built this , so everyone who has trans@@ formed a fast re@@ actor , a chan@@ nel fund for our first .
in your imagination , ti@@ mel@@ ine and prob@@ ability is something to really live in life ?
b@@ g : now we need one of these sc@@ al@@ able , carb@@ on-@@ gener@@ ating things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent , and then we use 20 years to use
that &apos;s kind of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environmental models have demon@@ strated to us that we need to stay .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ l power , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could keep easy .
and fortunately , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds of people , who , if they work , will act the fund@@ ing for their pil@@ ots , they can offer for it .
and it would be the best if it &apos;s creating multiple , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
anyway , we don &apos;t need a solution .
how about the great range of break@@ through@@ s , is this the biggest you know ?
b@@ g : a energy break@@ through is the most important .
it would have been either without the destruction of the environment , but it would be that much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other inven@@ ts .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ular method , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ pos@@ po@@ le type that seems a little hard , but maybe that &apos;s all about us .
and so there is different , but the beautiful thing about this is that a ancient molecule has a million times more energy than ours , say , we can deal with the solutions , and they are main@@ ly the radiation , the foot@@ print and the cost , the potential is the potential , so the foot@@ print and the costs , almost in a negative li@@ yer .
if that doesn &apos;t happen , then what ?
do we have to draw in@@ genu@@ ity interven@@ tions to try to keep the land@@ -@@ temperature stable ?
b@@ g : when you come into this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been eating too much , and just before you stand , what you &apos;re going to do ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research facili@@ ty called ge@@ o@@ engineering that foc@@ uses with various techniques to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate global warming , so we &apos;ve got 20 or 30 years more to join us together .
that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance method .
we &apos;re hop@@ ing we don &apos;t need it .
some people say that you shouldn &apos;t be working in in@@ sur@@ ance because you might do this la@@ zy , so you can continue to eat , because you know you &apos;re going to save the heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart if you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a dis@@ course in ge@@ o@@ engineering about whether you should have available that , if things come faster , or that innovation comes out more , than we expect .
cli@@ bal@@ ke@@ p@@ ti : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for the one to per@@ su@@ ade you ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tic lives in very different cam@@ ps .
the traditional argu@@ ments make the scientific argument are very little .
say that there are negative effects that can be done with the clou@@ ds that are shif@@ ting things ?
there are very , very few things that you can possibly tell , of which there is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is much more than hiv .
you do the er@@ r@@ ors now , and you pay it a lot later .
and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of ur@@ gent problems to invest in something that you just have , and that &apos;s where the investment is not so clear . in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c is not necessarily the worst story , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and there &apos;s people in the rich world that says , okay , that &apos;s not a big dra@@ ma .
the fact is that these un@@ certain@@ ty should be wor@@ rying to us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the skep@@ tics will say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter me , the skep@@ tics , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter to me that it doesn &apos;t em@@ ph@@ ate co2 , i wish almost that it &apos;s che@@ aper , but i &apos;ll probably accept it , because it &apos;s che@@ aper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the b@@ j@@ f@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other tar@@ gets in suffering , the poverty redu@@ ction , the cen@@ su@@ s of malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a du@@ m@@ b waste of resources to invest money , while there are better things that we can do .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending for research -- we &apos;ll say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they &apos;re doing today -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ matically .
apart are not supposed to suff@@ er other things .
so , you get to big money , and you can tran@@ sc@@ end reas@@ on@@ able people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and try to fin@@ ance it , and for me happens most of the waste here .
unless , you know , you &apos;re very quickly about a co@@ verage , and you &apos;re just paying learning the learning cur@@ ve , i think we should try more things that the potential has a lot less che@@ aper .
if the off@@ board wh@@ is@@ bs , what you get is a very high energy ri@@ ce , then the rich rou@@ te .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifest@@ yle .
for the base of two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g think about it .
his new ma@@ ke@@ a is , &quot; why isn &apos;t it going to interview the research ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to associ@@ ate because his former stories associated with the skep@@ tic@@ ist camp , but he understood that this is a very lon@@ ely group , and so he takes the research exploration .
and that &apos;s a temp@@ late that i &apos;m holding for .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it &apos;s going to be encoura@@ ging .
bill , i think for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
b@@ g : thank thank you .
a few years ago here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man wrote a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple : four teams have to have the largest possible structure with 20 sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , about 1@@ m ta@@ pe , about 1@@ square fa@@ ils and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be at the top of the top .
and , even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually really difficult , because people for@@ got very quickly together .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i put it into a design work@@ shop .
it was a terri@@ fic success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 work@@ sh@@ ops around the world , with students , develop@@ ers and architec@@ ts , even with c@@ to@@ s the fortun@@ e 5@@ 0-@@ dollar companies , and there &apos;s something about this job that i think is possible to share deep impres@@ sions in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with you .
in fact , most people usually start to ori@@ ent themselves in the task .
you talk about it , you think what it &apos;s going to look like , it ran@@ ps around .
then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization , and they sk@@ et@@ ch and sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
they spend a majority of their time in the lo@@ com@@ ot@@ alized combin@@ ation continu@@ ously in the
and then finally , before you have no time , someone takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they &apos;re putting it up ri@@ ght@@ fully on the top , takes a step back and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; ? ad@@ mi@@ ration their work .
but what , then , almost always , is that the ta@@ -@@ da is going to be like an &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low makes that the whole thing is stre@@ t@@ ched and in@@ fl@@ at@@ red .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh b@@ w@@ l .
they lie , they sha@@ ven , they &apos;re conf@@ used and they really produce decisi@@ on-@@ real shapes .
and of course , there are countries that have much more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; forms , and among the best are fres@@ ber@@ ship of kinder@@ garten .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter did , they didn &apos;t just produce the highest to@@ wers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you &apos;re going to ask is , how is this happening ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the children invest@@ ed in the sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in power@@ le .
now , there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that b@@ w@@ l &apos;s students were trained to find the one real plan , ok !
and he then reali@@ zed it .
what happens if you put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s not a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what kids do differently is that , with mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , they start building with mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and building prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , so that they multi@@ p@@ ly a lot of time to re@@ pair the see@@ ds of mu@@ d prototyp@@ es .
con@@ struc@@ tors recognize this kind of connection as a real@@ m of an i@@ ter@@ a@@ tively .
and with any trial , the children get inst@@ ant feedback , and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance is to work with prototyp@@ es , mostly -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are acting .
the average for most of it is about two in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ l students get half of them , law@@ yers are a little more , but not much , kinder@@ garten children are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful guy ?
architec@@ ts and engineers , for lu@@ ck@@ ary .
one hundred square is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and are safe self-@@ am@@ pli@@ fi@@ d-@@ di@@ ving ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric patterns the key to build stable structures .
ce@@ os are a little bit about average . but this is going to get interesting .
if you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , they &apos;re signific@@ antly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around , and you recognize , &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
you can predict the predi@@ ction . why is this happening ?
because they have specific skills of the process@@ ing .
they &apos;re leading the process , they understand it .
and there &apos;s that team that &apos;s spre@@ ading , and at the work , the team is signific@@ antly impro@@ ving performance .
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ ing skills and their combin@@ ation to succe@@ ed .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , which have stable structures .
i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the po@@ ker in a same way .
so i provi@@ ded a $ 00@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar software for the w@@ inn@@ ers .
what do they think about these design college students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened here . it wasn &apos;t a team that had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a 10@@ 5@@ -@@ in@@ ch con@@ struc@@ tion , he would have car@@ ried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competi@@ tions have a strong effect ?
we repe@@ ated this practice with the same students .
what do you think that was happening ?
now , they understand the advantage of the prototyp@@ ing .
so from the same , bad team of one individual has turned one under the best .
they produced the highest consi@@ ga@@ tions in the fu@@ west time .
there &apos;s dep@@ th res@@ identi@@ al lessons for us , about nature of in@@ cen@@ ting and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest time to create a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low &apos;s worth ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help team , to help helping teams , computers , video games and &quot; vision . &quot;
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low does is , it helps to identify them custom@@ i@@ zing their assu@@ mp@@ tions .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , basic post@@ ure , to build the right prototyp@@ e .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested can visit mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ ship ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
there &apos;s a step head@@ -@@ and-@@ drive allo@@ wan@@ ce there .
they find crazy examples from all over the world , like people tun@@ tu@@ ze the system and re@@ pl@@ in@@ ting .
there &apos;s also a world record .
and the base lesson , i think , is really , the appar@@ at@@ us is a treat@@ ous@@ ing sport .
it &apos;s worth that we all deal our senses to the task , and that we use our thinking opti@@ mal , like our emotions and our do , in the challenge that we &apos;re facing .
and sometimes a little prototyp@@ e of the experience is everything that it needs to bring us from an &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; -- to bring to a ta@@ -@@ da moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s do that as if we have a machine .
there &apos;s a big machine , a cool , ted-@@ -@@ like machine , and this is a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to sit in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t go in here and you can now stay .
and i wonder what they would choose , because i often asked my friends to often ask this question , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time , before there was cars , or &quot; twitter , &quot; &quot; america is going to head the super@@ star . &quot;
e@@ z@@ ra : i don &apos;t
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of dra@@ wn to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to your go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not a part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
it &apos;s because op@@ tions on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to get into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the great amount of time that ever gave birth on this planet , no matter what measure you : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunities , dec@@ lin@@ ing disease .
there was never been a time like this .
my ancient grand@@ parents were all died when they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents ur@@ ged that number to 70 .
my parents are 80 on the ro@@ cks .
so , there should be better one nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing to do .
a child who is born in new del@@ hi can expect as long to live as long as the world &apos;s rich@@ est man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this so ?
small@@ po@@ x . the small@@ po@@ x have killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve re-@@ sha@@ ped the demo@@ graphi@@ cs in a way of magni@@ tude in a way that has no war ever managed .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re disappe@@ ared .
we re@@ tain@@ ed it . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world there are diseases that millions of us have even one generation of us , almost even one generation .
di@@ ph@@ on , bu@@ t@@ n , pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful ...
does anyone know what this is ?
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are the success@@ es of the scientific method .
and so , from my perspective , the scientific method to try to test things , look at if it works , it will change it if it doesn &apos;t do that , is one of the greatest achie@@ v@@ ements of humanity .
so , that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s been the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
and one of them is that , despite all our achie@@ v@@ ements , a billion people in the world go to bed every day , hun@@ gry .
that number goes up , and it gets very fast , and it &apos;s com@@ e@@ cu@@ ting .
and not only that , we have used our imag@@ ination to re@@ hab@@ ili@@ t this world a very val@@ id world .
drin@@ king water , ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ cal land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas : they &apos;re disappe@@ aring , and if we don &apos;t rele@@ ase ourselves from this chaos , we tend .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t destro@@ y at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , it &apos;s not a clou@@ dy thinking .
but this is holding me a@@ wake at night -- one of the things that i think is going on at night . we &apos;ve never used scientific progress ever as ur@@ si@@ vely as now , never .
and we &apos;ve also been able to get it involved reas@@ on@@ able , just like we can do today .
we &apos;re on the ti@@ p of amazing , amazing events in many areas , and i really think that we should go back hundreds and 300 years before the in@@ struc@@ tions to find a time where we &apos;ve f@@ ought progress , where we &apos;ve done more of these things to more fron@@ ts on more fron@@ ts than now .
people are going to be in their faith , and it &apos;s so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t get rid of them .
it &apos;s not even the truth that will free it .
and listen , anybody has a right to their point , even a right to his opini@@ on of progress .
but you know what , what they don &apos;t have a right on ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; high ad@@ cent , they don &apos;t have .
and i needed a while to find it out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article on vac@@ cin@@ ation for &quot; the new yor@@ ker , &quot; a little article .
and i was ama@@ zed to de@@ vote to resi@@ stance , to resi@@ stance , to what is the most effective issue in health in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i did just what i would do , i wrote an article , and i kept going .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about gene@@ tically modi@@ fied fo@@ ods .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so , i also wrote about an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ ty , &quot; why they believed that molecules in a particular way should lead around the terri@@ tory of nature .
but , you know , i &apos;m doing what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on going .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we give up , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but i was wor@@ rying these artic@@ les to me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics that made me crazy were not making a fan@@ a@@ tic at all .
these were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , trained people , inno@@ cent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that &apos;s what energi@@ l me got me .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s say what we &apos;re honest .
we have gotten at a point where we don &apos;t have the same connection to progress as we ever used .
we &apos;re talking about it exploration .
we talk ir@@ onic about this , with small exhi@@ bi@@ tion about it : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s important about the causes .
we have the trust in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that should not be that way .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , ben@@ gl@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ tal , weapons destruction of destruction , rain@@ 2010 ele@@ ction elec@@ tions in the 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your your first list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we believed that they were always right . so , you know , skep@@ tical .
ask me , ask you the evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but now here &apos;s the thing : if you have to get evidence of this evidence , we &apos;re not good at it , and we &apos;re not good .
and i can say this from the reason , that we &apos;re living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and i hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story that brought out the autis@@ m epidemic with the mas@@ ses , mu@@ redu@@ es and the car@@ tel@@ ue v@@ acc@@ ine .
very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
cas@@ ual studies were done to see if that was cor@@ rect .
son@@ ori@@ ous study should be done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data began to come in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no connection , no connection , no .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter , because we believe in an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we think what we see , what we see , what we believe , that we make , that we really feel .
we don &apos;t think in a bunch of docum@@ ents from a government attack that gives us data , and i think that , i think , that we all do .
but , you know what ?
the result of this was dis@@ ast@@ ed ha@@ l .
cat@@ ha@@ l because of that fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world in which the imm@@ uni@@ zation for fern@@ s take place .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ ha@@ s , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
so what happened was that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does anybody actually have to produce ?
does a single audience in the audience have to see somebody die of grain ?
not very often , not very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but 6@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
these are a lot of dea@@ ths with dent@@ als , 20 per hour .
but because it &apos;s not happening here , we can deter@@ mine it , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can go around and look at artic@@ ches of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy of plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king pre-@@ pre@@ ach@@ ing .
and you can do that because they don &apos;t connect causes cause and cor@@ ners .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same is .
and this is something we have to learn , and it &apos;s very quick .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he liber@@ ated us from one of the worst rob@@ ments of humanity .
not fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , not qu@@ enti@@ al , child j@@ ams , pu@@ ghter , gone .
the guy in the middle wasn &apos;t so much .
he &apos;s called paul pres@@ it .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ vation v@@ acc@@ ine with a couple of other people .
it can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ - , 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world .
it &apos;s pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , that &apos;s good , bes@@ i@@ des that paul is running around and talking about vac@@ cin@@ es , and says how worth you are , and that people should just stop jam@@ ms .
and that &apos;s actually what it says .
so , paul is a terror@@ ist .
if paul talks about a public desire , he can &apos;t say without a be@@ a@@ w guar@@ an@@ tee .
he &apos;s getting calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
i don &apos;t need to say it , but vac@@ cin@@ es are im@@ pac@@ ting .
you can keep it going , go back the diseases , terrible diseases , and this is happening .
we have mas@@ ses in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die back to them , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die in mas@@ s .
what about sex ? let &apos;s take this . why not ? why not ?
a ser@@ dy phr@@ ase of mine gave me a few weeks ago , and she thought i &apos;m a little bit of pun@@ ch .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate her child for breast fr@@ and@@ y . no , no .
whe@@ el .
why ? because we have no pe@@ ac@@ e@@ fields . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in la@@ gos this morning &apos;s got into a plane , and he &apos;s flying to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about o@@ hi@@ o .
and he ends up in a couple hours and he lands a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these fantastic ted last ev@@ ening this morning .
and he doesn &apos;t know it &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ zing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works now .
this is the planet we &apos;re living on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to cra@@ ck us in lies . we love that .
have you all taken your vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ ate that helps them go on the jum@@ ps .
i know you &apos;ve done that , because half of the americans makes it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take the alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference of how often we find that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
the data continu@@ es all the time .
they &apos;re ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating their ur@@ ine . they almost do them more .
that &apos;s okay , they want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ci@@ in .
i &apos;m totally agre@@ ed to .
dark , dark ur@@ in . dark .
so why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical industry .
we hate an inten@@ se government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t have to . our health care system is mi@@ es .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and se@@ al@@ -@@ en@@ ab@@ ling to us that can afford .
so we &apos;re running out of the road , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re going to the poor of plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love plac@@ e@@ bo industri@@ es .
but , you know , it &apos;s really serious , because the stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little pro@@ pri@@ et@@ ors here .
not one of them -- g@@ ing@@ ko , be@@ ase , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ k , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s been been de@@ fe@@ ated .
and you know what ? if i say that , people scre@@ w me and say , &quot; what car@@ es you ? let people do what you want .
that &apos;s how they &apos;re feeling good . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t care , whether it &apos;s the health minister that says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m going to not expect the evidence of mammo@@ graph@@ y , or any cancer qu@@ ir@@ l al@@ ber who want to treat his patients with the lead agre@@ s . &quot;
when you go to this path where belie@@ fs and magic re@@ plac@@ ement and re@@ plac@@ ing science , they &apos;re going to get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people because he insi@@ sted that red bee@@ es , access and le@@ mon oil much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs are much more effectively more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs , we know that they can slow the rule of aids .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ finished dea@@ ths in a country that is worse than any other depen@@ dent of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have a con@@ sequence .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the most cer@@ di@@ a@@ c epidemic we &apos;re in at right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d battle between the as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of the gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te .
it &apos;s an i@@ ral debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
this is ide@@ ology , not science .
everything that we eat every ri@@ pe , every pe@@ er of pe@@ ac@@ e@@ y , every ro@@ se of ro@@ se , was changed by the people .
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ ines in par@@ ad@@ ise .
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe@@ -@@ mel@@ es .
there was no christ@@ mas trees . we did all of this .
we &apos;ve made it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of them worked , and some of them didn &apos;t .
we got rid of it , which didn &apos;t work .
now we can make it closer . and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a in ri@@ ce , and the stuff can help millions of people to ex@@ tend their life .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we syste@@ matically re@@ moved food .
so why do we do that ?
well , what i &apos;m going to hear is all of you : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want to have companies see@@ king see@@ ds .
and do you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re as@@ pi@@ ra@@ cting it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
and that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , mor@@ ality , pat@@ ent@@ y .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it works , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t toler@@ ate science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid is a real finger , and it &apos;s holding millions of people on top of bur@@ den .
you know , in the next 50 years , 70 percent , we &apos;re going to have to grow more food than right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa has been in the last 30 years .
sh@@ it . sh@@ am@@ ing .
you need that , and we &apos;re not giving it .
and why ? gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this ro@@ tten stuff , like mani@@ o@@ ok .
mani@@ o is something that is eating half a billion people .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists build all that in there .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be ignor@@ ed .
you wouldn &apos;t go star@@ vation , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be beautiful .
and so , all i can say is , why do we struggle this ?
i mean , why we &apos;re going to ask this : why do we struggle this ?
because we don &apos;t want to sho@@ u@@ ge around genes ?
it &apos;s not about making genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our resili@@ ence on greater food , better food , uni@@ qu@@ red food .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the ulti@@ mate time to understand what that means .
because do you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , when we continue as far as we do , we do some gu@@ il@@ ty that we want to be not gu@@ il@@ ty , high tech col@@ oni@@ alism
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s un@@ willing , it &apos;s our not wor@@ thy , and we have to really
so after this incredibly fun entertain@@ ment , you might say , &quot; well , do you still want to go into this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i &apos;m sure that . i &apos;m certainly saying .
at the moment , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can make this time machine on everything that we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;ll move them where we want to .
we have to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we have to think , but when we get into the time machine , and go into the future , we &apos;re gla@@ d to have done that .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect . it might seem strange that a ma@@ gi@@ cian is interested in it , unless you look it as me , as i like , as &quot; a de@@ ception that will be something to be tru@@ sted if somebody feels clear enough to do it if somebody thinks you &apos;re just good enough . &quot;
in other words , zu@@ cker@@ p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in some studies that are plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what &apos;s happening to her , is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or some kind of ... in pain management , for example , if the patient thinks of it , there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body that is called plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
a de@@ ception becomes something real , because somebody percei@@ ves it like this .
so , in order for us to understand , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that is at least since the 195@@ 0s in every magic book for kids .
i used to learn him from the cu@@ b sc@@ aus of the sum@@ beginn@@ ers in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;m going to take him out for you and then tell him .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain to him .
so , let &apos;s see what happens .
the kni@@ fe that you can analy@@ ze , my hand that you can study .
i &apos;m going to hold the kni@@ fe like this in my winter .
i &apos;m going back to my sle@@ e@@ ve .
and to make sure that nothing in my trouble is going away , or coming out of it , i &apos;m just going to push my wr@@ ist right here .
that can also note that at any time you can see something moving to zero , and as long as i &apos;m ligh@@ ting here , nothing can go to my sle@@ e@@ ve or come out of it .
and the goal of it is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all goes well , the kni@@ fe will be em@@ bed@@ ded by my favorite magnetic magne@@ tis@@ m .
it &apos;s actually so hard at his place that i can make it taste without the kni@@ fe fall@@ ing down .
nothing moves into my sle@@ e@@ ve or coming out , no dou@@ bt , and they can study all of it .
ta@@ -@@ da !
now , this is a trick that i often carry little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception , because you can actually learn a lot about de@@ ception , even though it &apos;s very simple to do .
probably a lot of you here in the room know this trick .
and it works like this .
i think the kni@@ fe in my hand .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m wander@@ ing my wr@@ ist to make sure that nothing can get rid of my ni@@ ght@@ ness or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i com@@ mit my wr@@ ist is that there &apos;s the actual secre@@ ts of illusion .
in that moment , where i turn my hand away from you , so that you see them from behind , this finger moves here , my inde@@ x finger , just from there where it was , in a position where it &apos;s so stre@@ t@@ ched .
terri@@ fic trick ?
there was somebody in the back there who didn &apos;t have a childhood .
so , he &apos;s standing here . right .
and when i turn around , the fing@@ ers change his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fing@@ ers on here , because the mind and the way it process information , it doesn &apos;t count including , one , two , three , but you see it as a group .
but that &apos;s actually not really what &apos;s going on . and then i open my hand .
of course , there &apos;s going to be hurt , but not through the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but a trick , through my thesis finger , which is there now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by i turn back , is hum@@ bled by this movement that the fing@@ ers will move back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
this is a trick you can do to your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
a year ago , i read a study or so , i read a study that really dre@@ w me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why this was an amazing thing for me .
well , so it turns out this : if you give a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white ball , in the form of an as@@ pir@@ in@@ tab@@ let , that &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill that has a particular measu@@ re@@ ment effect .
but if you give the shape in which you give the plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , alter into a smaller p@@ ill , and e@@ mu@@ late these blue and make a letter on it , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ able more effici@@ ent .
and that , of course , although none of them are a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- they &apos;re just sugar p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? that was really getting me out of my head
well , it turns out that that &apos;s not all of it .
when you take cap@@ su@@ les , the even more effective than tab@@ lets are every shape .
a black cap@@ su@@ le that &apos;s yellow at one end and at the other red , it &apos;s better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
the do@@ ti@@ fication is playing a role .
a mush@@ room is twice two times a day , not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember to the pre@@ cis@@ ely stati@@ stic . i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is , ...
... that too , the do@@ ses have a role .
and the form is played in a role .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you have to reach to the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with a sup@@ tili@@ ty -- a few milli@@ li@@ ters of an effective sub@@ stance that you inje@@ ct a patient .
that creates a very strong image in your head . that &apos;s much stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
this ch@@ art is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a proje@@ ctor .
so the fact of the matter is that the white p@@ ill doesn &apos;t appear as well as the blue p@@ ill that doesn &apos;t look as well as a cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t seem as well as the need@@ le .
and none of that has a real pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical property . it &apos;s just our belief in our confidence that is stron@@ ger in us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a de@@ ception , and let it look real .
we know from that study that you have to reach to the need@@ le , if it &apos;s supposed to be about the issue .
this is a 24@@ -@@ in@@ ch big hu@@ t@@ ne@@ l . she &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to first get a little bit ster@@ ili@@ zed .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not ste@@ asi@@ an speci@@ alized fl@@ es@@ h .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to zi@@ p this need@@ le in my skin and drive through them until they boun@@ ce on the other side .
if you &apos;re feeling bad -- if you &apos;re easy to fall in zero -- i &apos;ve pres@@ ented that a few friends in the hotel room last night , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman had to have almost a woman .
so i &apos;m suggest@@ ing , if you &apos;re fast , look at the next 30 seconds , you &apos;re looking away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first heal@@ ing part here .
you can see it just like , you can see it also , too , if you want
so , it goes right , right here where my metal starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to do a little whi@@ p .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make it crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin , and on the other side of the other side like this .
now , we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had when we were at sear@@ ser@@ atz .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , aren &apos;t you ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes .
i know what people can think , when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s certainly not so stupid and push through itself the skin just to enter us for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show it to you
what does this look like ? well , pretty good .
yeah , i have know .
and people back back@@ wards saying , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the side door are now in the side .
let me show you just one quick thing .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my hum@@ p , and i can fli@@ p this around .
sorry . if you &apos;re horri@@ ble , look away , look at it , don &apos;t look at it .
the people behind the back or those who later see video on video will say , &quot; well , that looks pretty impres@@ sive , but if it were real , it would -- you see , da a hole and there , if it really would be real , it would b@@ low . &quot;
okay , let me just fli@@ p a little bit of blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i usually would like to take the need@@ le out now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no je@@ gs .
but i think in this frame , and with the purpose , to make something real out of a de@@ ception , i &apos;m just going to let the need@@ le in there and go from the stage .
so we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
everyone &apos;s going to talk about happiness today .
i let some people count the number of books that were published with happiness , in the last five years , and they gave up after about 40 , and there was much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in which they &apos;re lucky in researchers
there &apos;s a lot of lu@@ ck@@ word co@@ ach@@ ing .
everyone would love to make people happ@@ ier .
but with all these flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive ones that just make it impossible , reas@@ fully think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to act pri@@ mar@@ ily by these cognitive tra@@ its .
this is true for la@@ ke that thinks about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re so ab@@ und@@ ant to be so ab@@ und@@ ant as everybody else .
the first one of these tra@@ cks is a commit@@ ment to ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly .
it turns out the word happiness is simply not a useful word anymore , because we &apos;re using it to a lot of different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we can nar@@ row it on , but in a way , it &apos;s something that we have to be giving up , and we &apos;re going to embra@@ ce the complicated perspective for what &apos;s good .
the second is a con@@ sequence of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy in his life and happiness about your life or happiness with your life .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both immer@@ sed in the idea of the happiness .
and the third is the concent@@ rational illusion , and that &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about a rever@@ si@@ bility that influ@@ ences well-@@ being , without barri@@ ing its meaning .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with somebody who had a q answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures that identi@@ fied a story . &#91; un@@ clear -- &#93; he said he had heard a lim@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely written music , and it was absolutely written by the end of the recor@@ ding , there was a terrible ro@@ cking sound .
and then , he ad@@ ded , really quite emotional , that has ru@@ ined the entire experience .
but that &apos;s not what it didn &apos;t .
and what it was ru@@ ined was the memor@@ ies of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had sp@@ len@@ did music for 20 minutes .
they didn &apos;t count because he was related to a memory , the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was everything he had gotten stopped .
so what this really says to us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there is a vi@@ vi@@ ty self that lives in the present and knows the present , is able to re@@ live the past , but actually have the present .
it &apos;s the driving self that com@@ pla@@ ined the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; do it look right if i can turn you here ? &quot;
and then there is a remin@@ ding self , and the memory self is this that coun@@ ts and reach@@ es the story of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor as@@ ks by saying the question , &quot; how did you dream ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different un@@ its , the sex self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and they &apos;re part of the sub@@ stance of happiness of happiness .
now , the memory itself is a story@@ t@@ eller .
and that really starts with a profound impli@@ cation to our memor@@ ies -- it starts to start .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can hold away from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s take you to take an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are actual patients who participa@@ te in a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
i won &apos;t go into the details . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful today , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was done in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to talk about their pain every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their recor@@ ds .
and they &apos;re asking , &quot; who of both has more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suff@@ ered more . his fli@@ p refle@@ ction was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had hal@@ ved , and more .
but now , there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients thought they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s what a surprise is .
and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse remem@@ ber@@ ing to the screen refle@@ ction than the patient b .
the stories of repres@@ enting refle@@ ctions were different , and because a very important part of the story is , how it ends .
and none of these stories is very in@@ geni@@ ous or great -- but one of them is so clear .
but one of them is very sever@@ ely worse than the other .
and the one who is worse was the place where the pain was at the end of his cli@@ ma@@ x . it &apos;s a bad story .
how don &apos;t we know that ?
because we asked these people after their gut refle@@ ction , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the full thing in all ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in the b for b .
now , this is a direct conflict between the ear@@ living self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
from the cen@@ sor@@ s of the extin@@ ct , it had definitely a worse time .
now , what you could do with the patient , and we actually did a clinical experiments , and it was made , and it works , you could actually ex@@ tend the sight of the patient by just incre@@ bing the tube without sha@@ king up too much on it .
it &apos;s going to cause the patient , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you do this for a few minutes you make that the living self is poor from the patient , and you get that the memory itself is far better off by the patient , because now you have a better story about his experience .
so what did a story re@@ pel ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that are provi@@ ding to memory , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we &apos;re creating .
so what a story is done is tran@@ scen@@ ding , sever@@ ing moments and ends .
end are very , very important , and in this case the end was domin@@ ated .
now , the oper@@ ant self lives his life continu@@ ously .
it has moments of life , one after the other .
and you say , what &apos;s going to happen to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most look look of our life -- and i sus@@ pe@@ ct it -- you know , psych@@ ological present is true for about three seconds , meaning , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a life , meaning , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 . most of you won &apos;t leave a lan@@ ce .
most of them will be completely ignor@@ ed from remem@@ ber@@ ing themselves .
and yet , they always get the impres@@ sion that they should count that what happens during this gl@@ esti@@ ght of aff@@ air@@ s is our life .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re consum@@ ing as we are in the world .
and how we need it would be important to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that kee@@ ps the memory itself for us .
so we have the memory self and the lear@@ ner itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the circu@@ time of time .
so from the stand@@ life itself , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the lon@@ ge@@ less vac@@ ation .
that &apos;s not going to work at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
even for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is har@@ dly better than the one teen@@ eless vac@@ ation , because there are no new memor@@ ies to be ad@@ ded .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a memor@@ able self from an e@@ ternal self . time has very little impact on this story .
now , the memory itself is more than remem@@ ber@@ ing and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who , if you have two patterns at two different surge@@ ons and deci@@ d@@ s what it should choose , then the one who choo@@ ses the memory , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on who will be sel@@ ec@@ ted .
the living self doesn &apos;t have a voice in that choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t actually vote between experience . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think about our future as a experience .
we think about our future as perhaps the most important memor@@ ies .
and , in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of memory itself , and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self as one , that kind of the most well-@@ living self with experiences that the fol@@ ds don &apos;t need to live .
i have the impres@@ sion that , when we do vac@@ oc@@ um , it &apos;s very common the case , which means we &apos;re making vac@@ ation lar@@ sters in the service of remem@@ ber@@ ing itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
i mean , how much do we store from our memor@@ ies ?
this is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ant of remem@@ ber@@ ing itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vac@@ ation that we &apos;ve been doing in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i had ever had , and i think relatively often , in relation to how many times i think about how often i think of other vac@@ a@@ ged peri@@ ods .
and i probably would have about my memor@@ ies on this three-@@ wee@@ che trip , i would say , for 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the transl@@ ator with the 600 pictures in this , i would have spent another hour .
well , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s a only one and a half hours .
there seems to be a dis@@ agre@@ ement there .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have at the business of memor@@ ies , but even when you make more of them there , there &apos;s a real question : why do we give memor@@ ies so much of the time to the weight that we &apos;re giving to experience ?
so , i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next ho@@ li@@ day , you know that at the end of the pa@@ pe , everyone &apos;s depres@@ sed to all their images , and you get a am@@ nes@@ eric drug , so you won &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you were to choose another vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two selves , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think about time , you &apos;ll get an answer . and if you think of memor@@ ies , you could get a different answer .
why we choose the ambi@@ ti@@ se that we choose is a problem that comes with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two other kinds of self are thro@@ wing two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can use , one per per self .
so you can ask : how happy is this const@@ ant self ?
and then you &apos;d ask : how lucky are the moments in the life of the earth itself ?
and you &apos;re all -- happiness for ev@@ ange@@ ings is a pretty complicated process .
and which are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to make a pretty good idea about happiness itself over time .
if you ask , after the happiness of remem@@ ber@@ ing itself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about happiness or enjo@@ ying the person if this person is thinking about their lives .
very different phr@@ ase .
anyone who &apos;s not dist@@ ingu@@ ished these terms will be different to exploration , and i &apos;m agre@@ ed to a lot of researchers about well-@@ being that mess@@ ed the exploration of happiness long on that kind of way .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness itself and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in recent years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate separate .
the gall@@ up organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asking about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there have been a lot of effort in the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve been beginning to learn about happiness of the two types of self .
and the main lesson we have , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and they really don &apos;t really know a lot about how happy he lives his life and vice ver@@ sa .
just to give you an idea of cor@@ rela@@ tions , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
so what that means is , if you were to meet someone , and you would tell you , oh , his dad &apos;s a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
they have so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life at a level of 10 have ar@@ ran@@ ged at a number of 10 , they have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy it is with his ear@@ ned selves .
and so the cor@@ relation is smaller .
we know something about what &apos;s caus@@ ing happiness of happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , and goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically to be satis@@ fied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other enjo@@ y@@ ment , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the lu@@ ck of the two selves of self , they will end up doing very different things at the
so the impli@@ cations of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t really think of happiness as a re@@ plac@@ ement for well-@@ being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , just very brie@@ fly , another reason that we can &apos;t really think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the cor@@ rect answer .
if you think this question you think the people in california have to be happ@@ ier if they , say , in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is that , if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in the climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the occu@@ pa@@ tion itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the thou@@ ght@@ ful self that choo@@ sing how happy people are .
well , because the atten@@ d@@ able self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could get to california at the end .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pur@@ sue what happens to people who want to draw to california in hope to get happ@@ ier .
now , your ac@@ tili@@ ty self is not going to be happ@@ ier .
we know this .
but one thing &apos;s going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happ@@ ier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , how awful the weather in o@@ hi@@ o was , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right choice .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-@@ being , and i hope i have to tell you a picture of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you very much .
now , when we launched tele@@ phone a couple of weeks ago , they announ@@ ced to me that it was a pretty interesting out@@ come that came out of this gall@@ on .
is this something that they can tun@@ e to us because they &apos;ve left a couple of minutes to get here for a few minutes ?
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the gall@@ up survey is a number that we &apos;ve absolutely not had thought about .
and we found that in terms of happiness to occu@@ pa@@ tion .
when we looked at how feelings vari@@ ation with income .
and it turns out that , under a head of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sam@@ ple of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a big repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple , under a coun@@ cil of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year .
six@@ t@@ y-@@ two .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year are people un@@ happy , and they &apos;re becoming increasingly un@@ happy , the longer they &apos;re going to be .
and we get an absolutely flat line on that .
i mean , i r@@ ar@@ ely see the flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money makes a experience happiness , but that a lack of money sur@@ ely encoura@@ ges you , and we can measure this mis@@ er@@ able very , very clearly measure .
in the sense of the other self , the recei@@ ving itself , they get a different story .
the more money you ear@@ n the happy you &apos;re happ@@ ier .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but dan@@ ny , across all of the american commit@@ ments , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people were seriously taking this vie@@ ws , i mean , it seems to be anything on the head , everything that we believe , for example , on tour@@ aling policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country general would take a contr@@ ary like serious , and make it based on politics ?
d@@ k : you know , i think it gives you recogni@@ tion for the role of happiness in politics .
the recogni@@ tion will be slow in the united states , not question , but in the united king@@ dom , they &apos;re going to be happening , and in other countries , they &apos;re going
people are to recognize that they should think of lu@@ ck when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to explore experience happiness , or explore food re@@ vie@@ ws , so we have to have this discussion quite soon .
how to increase happiness can be very different depen@@ ds on how you think and whether you think of the more memory , or if they think of the life@@ living self .
that will impact policy , i think policy in the coming years .
in the united states , you are te@@ dd@@ ant to measure the experience happiness of the population .
that will , i think , will be part of the national stati@@ stic or two of the national subject .
now , it seems to me that this top@@ ic is going , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to pur@@ sue over the next couple of years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
thank you very , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m designing video games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , to save the world as it &apos;s in online games .
i have a plan for it . i want to convince more people , including them all , spend more time with games more and more amazing games .
at the moment , we spend three billion hours a week with online games .
so some of you may be thinking , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little bit too much time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , in the institute for the institute for the future , i &apos;m following the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most pres@@ sing problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced , if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dra@@ sti@@ cally increase this time .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated that time at 21 billion hours a week is used at 21 billion hours of play
that may seem something that seems to me first , so i repe@@ at it so that if we want to work , if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think we have to try to solve games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean really , i mean .
why ? this picture descri@@ bes very pre@@ cis@@ ely , why i believe that games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . quite sever@@ e .
this is a photograph@@ er by the photograph@@ er phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
he wanted to capture the feelings in play , so in front of the players , he created a camera .
this is one of the classi@@ c expres@@ sions in games .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might dis@@ solve some of the optimis@@ es in this picture .
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little fear , but also transpar@@ ent concent@@ ration , which is rapi@@ dly moving into the resol@@ ve of a really difficult problem .
if you also play , you see some nu@@ an@@ ces here , which are up up@@ sta@@ irs and the mouth is a symbol of optimis@@ m . the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ w illu@@ str@@ ates surprise .
this is a custom@@ er which is on the edge of a so-@@ called epi@@ ic se@@ al .
oh , you know that . okay . exc@@ use me . so we have some players here .
a epi@@ c vic@@ tory is a result , which is so sur@@ bi@@ ic , that they didn &apos;t know that it was at all possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when they get it , they &apos;re sho@@ cked that they &apos;re actually capable of this thing . that &apos;s an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
this player is just about a soli@@ cal vic@@ tory .
and this is what we need to see in millions faces of proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ ou@@ s@@ ers around the world , if we attack the barri@@ ers of the next century , the face of those who are facing the el@@ se@@ will on the edge of a cer@@ ic sea .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we look at hard problems .
i call it a bad face as &quot; life i &apos;m bad &quot; face . and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? yeah ? ok .
this is me , what i &apos;m doing , &apos; in life i &apos;m doing bad face .
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i study in my ph@@ d work why we &apos;re better in games than in real life than in real life .
this is a problem that a lot of players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in reality as in play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s what it bel@@ ong to .
we &apos;re getting more in the play@@ worl@@ ts . i &apos;m talking very well with the motivation to do something significant , inspired to collaboration with each other .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think many of us turn into our best version , any@@ time , and inst@@ antly are willing to help solve the problem , attemp@@ t as long as necessary , having it slowly attemp@@ t to be able to catch again after the fail .
and in fact , if we &apos;re fail@@ ing , when we break on ob@@ stac@@ les , we often feel different .
we &apos;re feeling over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we feel de@@ fe@@ ated . we feel thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
now , these feelings have never occur@@ red if we play games , they just play them .
and this is what i wanted to investi@@ gate as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think , you can &apos;t just reach it all ?
how can we trans@@ late these feelings from the game into the reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of war@@ craft that provi@@ des the ide@@ al environment to the collective proble@@ m-@@ solving .
and i &apos;ve identi@@ fied a couple of things that make the epi@@ c vic@@ tory in online worl@@ ds .
so , first , if you get on one of these online games , especially world war@@ craft , there are a lot of different characters willing to be willing to trust you a global mission , inst@@ antly .
but not just any mission , but a mission that is perfectly fit to your current level in the game , right ?
so you &apos;re going to do that .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the side of your ability , so you have to keep ti@@ ght , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in the world of war@@ craft .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and you &apos;re twi@@ sting . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of collabor@@ ators .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their fa@@ te mission .
we don &apos;t have that simple in the real life , that feeling that a finger@@ stro@@ ke is ready to be happy to hold .
and also , there is this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get this all positive feedback .
they have heard about &quot; levels of high &quot; and &quot; 25@@ 1 strength &quot; or &quot; four@@ 1 intelligence . &quot;
that const@@ ant feedback is not in the real world .
if i go to this stage , i didn &apos;t have to talk -- al 1 , and i , plus 20 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get the feedback in the true life .
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative media worl@@ ds like the world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to stand at any@@ moment on the edge of a epi@@ c vic@@ tory , that we pre@@ fer all our time in these games .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
up to today , all the world of war@@ cra@@ fing players have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years to solve the virtual issues of a@@ er@@ engine .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound mess@@ y .
but to look at it in the context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago our first pri@@ mate ancestors began to walk up@@ right .
so the first step of fast pri@@ mate .
ok , so when we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend right now , that makes sense just when you keep time in terms of scale in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out that by using all this time on play , because it turns out that by using all this time , what we are as people are
we &apos;re developing to collabor@@ ative thinking , heart creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe in .
now , if you look at this interesting stati@@ stic that was repor@@ ted recently by a study of car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university , the average young human being spent 10,000 hours in a country with sever@@ e tv culture to the year of the 21@@ st century .
now , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first , for kids in the united states , for children in the united states , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours they spend in school from the fif@@ th grade to stop high school -- when you don &apos;t .
so here we have a complete par@@ alle@@ l education , where young people learn exactly what it means to be a good player , like everything else that you &apos;re learning at school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; head@@ bla@@ gers . &quot;
so , you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the si@@ ck@@ est to study in any particular part of the 21@@ st century to the 21@@ st century , we &apos;re going to master within it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at whatever we do , like the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the ma@@ ster@@ -@@ players .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players of ma@@ ster@@ y good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never would have never been there before human potential .
so many people we have right now in the world , who spend at least an hour each day with online games .
these are our ma@@ ster@@ -@@ player : 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion subje@@ cts that are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the play industri@@ es developed con@@ form@@ es that save energy and work on power plants instead of the broad@@ band internet , with gam@@ ers around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online .
you would expect another billion billion players in the next decade .
that &apos;s how we &apos;ve got 1.@@ 5 billion players .
so i started to think about what it is that &apos;s what these games are doing in us .
here are the four things that i found . first : vulner@@ ability optimis@@ m .
ok , think of it as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation .
vulner@@ ability optimis@@ m is desire to do something right now to fo@@ ften a hur@@ d@@ le , with the faith that we have an obs@@ essi@@ sted hope on success .
player always belie@@ ves that an ex@@ ternal vic@@ tory is possible , and that it &apos;s always wor@@ rying to try and keep it right .
gam@@ ers are not sitting down .
his players are ap@@ sters in the spi@@ ders of a po@@ et social bed .
there are a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more , after we played with them , even if they &apos;ve a@@ im@@ ed us .
the reason for that is that it dem@@ ands a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we &apos;re tru@@ sting that someone &apos;s giving us time that the rules are going to be stopped , that we have the same goal and to the end of the game .
so that allows that interaction to grow from addi@@ cts , trust and with each other .
as a result , we build stron@@ ger social relationships .
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . amazing !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of war@@ cra@@ l players play 22 hours a week , sort of part@@ -@@ time job .
the reason is , when we play , we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier at work harder than if we &apos;re rela@@ x@@ ing or doing nothing .
we know that as human beings work opti@@ mal , we do hard , meaning@@ ful work .
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , ac@@ ute importance .
gam@@ ers love to be part of a@@ sten@@ si@@ ble mis@@ sions of modern chines@@ es .
here &apos;s a back forma@@ tion to bring it into the bottom of the light , you know all wikipedia , the largest wi@@ ki of the world .
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 in@@ t@@ nan@@ ts is the world of war@@ craft ben@@ ki .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve put more information about the world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other issue in every other wi@@ ki in every other wi@@ ki of the world .
they create an epi@@ c story .
it &apos;s creating a epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
ok , so , so that &apos;s four super@@ power@@ s that lead to a single result . players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as an individual .
and the only problem is that you think they can change the virtual worl@@ ds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem that i try to solve .
ed@@ ward ca@@ at@@ o@@ va is a fol@@ k scientist .
his work is great . he explor@@ es why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to paint not less than a mass u@@ migra@@ tion in virtual worl@@ ds in virtual worl@@ ds and online shif@@ ts . &quot;
and it &apos;s by an econom@@ ist . so , it &apos;s logi@@ cal .
and he says , &quot; ...
i don &apos;t like play , i &apos;m playing , i &apos;m a little bit wa@@ ste@@ ful .
so , he says , that makes sense actually , because players can achieve more in online worl@@ ds than in real life .
they can make in games more powerful social bin@@ ties than in real life . they get more feedback and re@@ wards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s completely logi@@ cal that gam@@ les spend more time in the virtual world than in real use .
i agree to you , it &apos;s logi@@ cal .
but it &apos;s definitely not a opti@@ tic situation .
we need to start to transform the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s left back 2,@@ 500 years .
there &apos;s these an@@ en cu@@ be made out of she@@ ets . you know ?
in front of these fantastic game controll@@ ers , there was a she@@ et of she@@ ep .
and these were kind of the first of people who were evol@@ ving play@@ struc@@ ts .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the func@@ tion@@ ing of ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian her@@ ck@@ ot@@ us , you may know this story . the story about how , and why games have been invented .
now , according to her@@ l@@ ot@@ us games , games were experiment@@ al , in the king@@ dom of ly@@ di@@ es , in a fam@@ ine .
now sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly , there was such a big fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ di@@ es were held to a crazy idea .
people suff@@ ered . people were f@@ ed .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , from her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the hon@@ e@@ al game and negoti@@ ated a national strategy , and one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be wired so much in the box game , because gam@@ ingly , they &apos;re so fascinating and they surro@@ unded us with satis@@ fying , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and before her@@ so@@ ot@@ us , they were doing this fam@@ ine , so 18 years ago , by eating one day and the next intervie@@ ws .
also , i think , we &apos;re going to let go today games .
we &apos;re playing games to solve the true world the true world .
we &apos;re playing an play to solve everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that is not proper@@ ly satis@@ fying in the real life , and we &apos;re going to get ourselves out of what we need from the games
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting one .
now , for 18 years , because her@@ l@@ ot@@ us wasn &apos;t better at the age of fam@@ ine , so the king decided to put one last bar@@ k game .
they divi@@ ded the king@@ dom in two .
they played a cu@@ pi@@ a game , and the w@@ inner had decided to break into a epi@@ ic ad@@ vent@@ ure .
they left ly@@ di@@ es and they started looking for a new home , they just got so many people back , as they had food to survive , and they looked at the rest to an area in which they could .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the lat@@ est dna evidence shows that the implan@@ tation , which was later the ro@@ man real@@ m , was repres@@ ented the same dna as the old ly@@ di@@ er .
so scientists recently came to view that her@@ p@@ ot@@ us &apos;s crazy story was actually true .
and ge@@ ologists found the evidence of a global cool@@ ing , that used almost 20 years to explain what the fam@@ ine primi@@ tive could explain .
so this crazy story could be heard .
maybe they actually saved their people through games by 18 years , by watching in games for 18 years , and then they had this agre@@ ement and so much about playing with each other that they saved the entire civilization .
so , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing since 199@@ 4 war@@ craft .
that was the first strategy in the world of war@@ cra@@ l series in real time . this was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years of to@@ we@@ l , we play dir@@ at@@ ore for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own signi@@ fi@@ al play .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , and so i took my 21 billion dollar hours a week .
we should over@@ come that half of us spend an hour a day on play until we solved the problems of the physical world .
now , i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world ? &quot; and so , exactly this question , i &apos;ve de@@ vot@@ ed my work in the last few years at the institute .
we have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , it pres@@ cri@@ es how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want , is to create the future .
we want to introdu@@ ce the best possible out@@ comes , and then to em@@ power people to imple@@ ment this idea in reality .
we make islam@@ ic vic@@ tor@@ ies and we give people the ways to achie@@ ve it .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to bring people out of epi@@ c sur@@ ger@@ ies in their own future .
this one is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is at 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to over@@ come a degre@@ arb@@ ness of oil .
the oil sc@@ ar@@ city is invented , but we have enough online content to be reali@@ stic for you , and you &apos;re living your real life without oil . so , if you write up to game , say where you live . and then you get news movies in real time that you show how much oil hits , how do food be closed , whether it &apos;s there , whether it &apos;s ks . and then you have to figure out how to create your real life , if it was true , and we ask them to do their real life if it were true . and we ask them to hi@@ re about it , send videos or photographs .
we &apos;ve te@@ sted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been talking about it for the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment , or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure , and they &apos;ll get said , &quot; we &apos;re running out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure that you &apos;re going to go on .
find out how they would survive , and most of our fellow players have main@@ tain@@ ed the work of the game .
so we have a bigger , bigger target for the next biggest game than just oil sc@@ ar@@ city .
we have developed the game &quot; super@@ fu@@ sel@@ ures &quot; at the institute for the future .
so starting in view is the compu@@ tation of a super@@ computer that people only have left 23 years on the planet .
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global curi@@ osity , sensi@@ tivity system , &quot; of course .
the call of the players to express themselves , we almost created like a &quot; jer@@ ry stu@@ ck@@ a@@ id &quot; film .
you know , jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ a@@ lic movies , where it &apos;s the f@@ am@@ -@@ team . you have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientists , the ex@@ -@@ hol@@ ds , and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in the wo@@ am team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
ei@@ sand@@ ,000 players were playing the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 creative solutions that they could read when they goo@@ gl@@ ed &quot; super@@ fu@@ tili@@ que . &quot;
and the last piece of play we bring out on the third of mar@@ ch . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you separate that game , you get the world bank a@@ ward &quot; social transi@@ tion@@ ary , &quot; gradu@@ ated in 2010 .
we work with universi@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we invi@@ te them to learn social re@@ actions .
we have a com@@ ic thing to it . we have &quot; level high &quot; for regi@@ onal understanding , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity .
i want to invi@@ te you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , in developing places that benefit from them , and introdu@@ ce their own social enter@@ prise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to go to the end .
i want to ask you a little question .
what do you think they &apos;re going to be next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree to me that gam@@ ers are human resource , which we can to use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these whole super@@ power@@ s , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to atta@@ ch in@@ her@@ ent social nets , dur@@ ability optimis@@ m and the desire for pro@@ of .
i really hope that we play together very significant games to survive on this planet a next century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design with me and play with me like this .
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m safe at two things : that we can create any imag@@ ent@@ able future , and that we can play all sorts of games .
so i &apos;m saying , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
thank you . .
i &apos;d like to share with you something that occur@@ red to me a few months ago in writing a austr@@ an ali@@ g article .
i always had my syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary gri@@ pped through my syn@@ ony@@ m , but i &apos;ve been fascin@@ ated with the art@@ math of the text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never listen@@ ed in my life what the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll let you introdu@@ ce the post .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , &quot; ad@@ je@@ ctive , religious , destro@@ ying , wa@@ sted , res@@ pir@@ ed , wo@@ unded , d@@ ust , dis@@ coura@@ ged , tor@@ tured , im@@ po@@ und , im@@ po@@ tent , dis@@ posed , dis@@ connected , ge@@ han@@ di@@ te sen@@ k , a@@ wake , rem , ge@@ th@@ di@@ te sen@@ k , ancient te@@ ar , emer@@ ged from the background , tun@@ ed , doing , yes , viol@@ ate , us@@ eless , ab@@ and@@ oned , ab@@ and@@ oned , ab@@ and@@ able and we@@ ak .
ant@@ q@@ m : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend of mine , and had to lau@@ gh at , it was so ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but i got to say , &quot; i just can &apos;t talk , &quot; and i had to stop talking and collect , and i had to stop , first after this over@@ conf@@ essed word sp@@ ab@@ led and the associated emotional sho@@ ck .
of course , this was a popular , old syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary . i just thought the pit@@ ch@@ ment had to be pretty old .
but actually , it was a theme in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , when i was just beginning with element@@ ary school , and i started building my self-@@ vision out of my family space , also in relation to other kids and to the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use syn@@ ony@@ m dic@@ tion@@ ary at that time .
if i were to take this her@@ self seriously , i would be born in a world that would sense someone like me , whose life could be positive . now , i &apos;m going to be cele@@ br@@ ated for the opportunity and ad@@ vent@@ ure that i experienced . but today , i &apos;m cele@@ br@@ ating the opportunity and ad@@ vent@@ ure that i &apos;ve experienced
so i immediately called up the online edi@@ tion of 2009 expe@@ cted , and i was expected to give a group of speaking here .
here &apos;s the fo@@ unding version of this in the program .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
specifically the last two words under &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ m &quot; is &quot; absolutely &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are sitting in these words , and how we constru@@ ct these values .
our language is affec@@ ting our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
in many recent societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the ro@@ wel@@ s , they really believed that the price of a flight has really got a huge force , because whatever you &apos;re talking about is also mani@@ fest .
so , what do we really want to become mani@@ fest -- a dis@@ ab@@ led of people or a powerful people ?
just in writing a man as a child , they could express , band them and sign them up and deliver ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up the do@@ ors ?
a person who opened for me , again , was my pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cian at a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton in del@@ soon .
he &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o . a it@@ al americans , he can think that most americans have not been able to communicate cor@@ rec@@ tly , so he was always called called dr. p@@ . .
and dr. p@@ . lo@@ cks very color@@ ed , and was just created for kids how to work with children .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just fab@@ ul@@ ously -- to my physi@@ cal therapy .
i had to have individual practic@@ es to keep the individual , el@@ a@@ stic ben@@ ds with these big , el@@ a@@ stic ben@@ ds -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg mus@@ cles . and i hat@@ ed these be@@ ach@@ es than everything . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them .
and imagine if i did as a five-@@ year-old kid with dr. p@@ . negoti@@ ation , and so tries to stop these practic@@ es , natural without success .
and one day he read me with one of my professional practic@@ es -- these pa@@ pers were just ti@@ ring and ad@@ jac@@ ent -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re such a strong , ener@@ ge@@ tic and chil@@ sty girl , you will one day cover one of those b@@ links .
and if you do , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now that was , of course , a simple trick of dr. p@@ . so that i did not want to do the practic@@ es i didn &apos;t want to do , with the idea that five-@@ five girls in the hospital , but he actually made me to see my daily design hor@@ ror with new eyes , and so he was actually a new and a very promis@@ ing experience .
and i wonder today how much of his vision of me has sha@@ ped my sense of view as a big and powerful young girl , and i could imagine to see me as a natural nature of strong , coura@@ ge@@ ous and at@@ le@@ th@@ ic man .
this is just one example of many , many ways that adults can rel@@ ate to the imagination of a child .
but as they prove these already trained examples from syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ aries , our language makes no room to imagine what we would wish we would all wish : to have every single one to see ourselves as a powerful human being .
our language is based on the social changes that have been caused by many of the technologi@@ cal change in many cases .
and from medical stand@@ point , of course , you can tell that my legs , which las@@ er surgery for visu@@ al@@ y-@@ dis@@ ab@@ led , k@@ od@@ les from ti@@ tan and art@@ ly chain of calls for aging , that allow people to really use their own possibilities and there@@ across the boundar@@ ies that have their natural dest@@ in@@ y to develop , not to mention their own open@@ ness and define their own identity , and to share in the world all the way to groups they choose themselves in their way .
now , it may be clear to this technologi@@ cal change , because ever that there was always a different truth , that every human in society can give something very special and very powerful , and that the human capacity to custom@@ ize , our biggest plus is to custom@@ ize itself , our size plus .
the human ability to custom@@ ize -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell me how to deal with san@@ chan@@ t@@ ability , and i &apos;ll always say to you , this phr@@ ase has never accep@@ ted for me , and i &apos;ve always felt really un@@ comfortable to answer questions of people , and i believe therefore , finally , why .
this monit@@ y of dealing with v@@ ali@@ ties lives by the idea that success or happiness depen@@ ds to address a challenge without being sha@@ ped by the associated experience , as if my life would have been so successful , as if i could , i could percei@@ ve the potential of a life with a pro@@ s@@ thetic , or whatever people percei@@ ve me with my dis@@ ability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re inten@@ ded by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotion@@ ally or even both of these .
and i want to argue that that is good .
ridi@@ city is not a ob@@ stac@@ le that we have to tran@@ cur@@ late to get better with our lives .
ten@@ ds are easy to live to our lives .
and i tend to think of nur@@ turing heal@@ ing as my sha@@ dow .
sometimes i &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s har@@ dly to see , but he &apos;s constantly with me .
and i don &apos;t want to stick with the impact of a human &apos;s mark , immer@@ se the hard one .
there are vac@@ u@@ ties and challenges in life , and they &apos;re just non@@ e@@ ds real , and each person &apos;s going to deal with it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re concerned with san@@ chan@@ ti@@ ties , or not , but how we &apos;re em@@ powered to be aware of it .
so we are not just responsible to preser@@ ve the people that we love to save from dan@@ f ta@@ gs , but also to pre@@ p@@ are them to get good with it .
and we don &apos;t like our kids to be happy if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t fit .
you have to conclu@@ de two things : for one reason , the medical field , am@@ pu@@ tion , and on the other social opini@@ on about whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
and to be honest , the only real and en@@ ab@@ ling dis@@ ability that i needed to explore with is that the world was constantly changing , you can describe me with these defini@@ tions .
in our desire to protect the people who are at risk and they are the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ cla@@ mption , or even a pro@@ test for quality of life that they expected , we have to ad@@ mit that we don &apos;t actually have to lay the shel@@ ter for ligh@@ ting that somebody &apos;s actually dis@@ ab@@
maybe this is the concept concept that only represents what &apos;s in a broken , and how we re@@ pair it , for every one positive dis@@ ruption than the path@@ ology itself is in itself .
if we don &apos;t treat a person full of wh@@ ol@@ lation , and we can &apos;t percei@@ ve all of its forces and opportunities , we create in addition to the natural struggle you might have to lead , one more disease .
we num@@ b a human society that has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the pat@@ ology and concent@@ rate on all the real@@ m of human possibilities .
most important , now , there &apos;s between the perception of our in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cy and our great inven@@ tive spirit , a connection .
we should not be high@@ ligh@@ ted or den@@ kli@@ ci@@ zed these challenges , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , nor we should go under the car@@ pet , but it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing the opportunities .
i &apos;m probably trying to make sure to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to tran@@ sc@@ end ourselves , but that we &apos;re open , you hu@@ mili@@ ate , you change them , to wra@@ p them up , to use a qu@@ ir@@ k , and maybe to dance .
and maybe we create it to en@@ h@@ ance ourselves as something natural , informa@@ tion@@ ally and useful , and don &apos;t feel so a@@ in through your pres@@ ence .
in this year , we cele@@ br@@ ated the 200@@ th birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous to something very true in human character .
i would change it this way : not the most powerful of his species , and not the most intelligent of this species , but the one that can ada@@ pt to the best .
out of confli@@ cts , creativity built .
it &apos;s not just from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of man to survive and to rot , is to transform and to fl@@ our@@ ish , by the struggle of the human spirit to transform confli@@ cts .
so , again , change and custom@@ i@@ zation are the greatest quali@@ ties of the people .
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re stock@@ pil@@ ed , when we really get to be re@@ sted .
which is , possibly , that the sense of ad@@ v@@ ance , a sense of the chaos , a sense of our own power@@ s .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give am@@ und@@ ali@@ ties a new meaning that goes beyond the heavy times .
maybe we can look at res@@ pir@@ ation as change .
ridi@@ c@@ tivity is about a change that we haven &apos;t adop@@ ted yet .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve en@@ counter@@ ed ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
what &apos;s positive -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal one .
there &apos;s the common . the typical . but not the normal one . and would you really learn this poor , gra@@ y person , if you really had them ?
i don &apos;t think so many times .
it would be great if we put this paradig@@ m of normal@@ ity against a different capacity , or the strength that could even resol@@ ve it a little bit more dangerous , and so we can rele@@ ase the forces of lots of kids , and invi@@ te them to bring their particular and meaning@@ ful skills into the society .
car@@ pol@@ ie found out that we have always challen@@ ged people from the partici@@ pants of our society : to be prob@@ able and to contribu@@ te a contribu@@ tion .
there are hin@@ ts that in the ne@@ anderth@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago already , older people and people have contribu@@ ted with sever@@ e physical in@@ ju@@ ries , and this may be because the life experience of this people was more valuable for society .
they haven &apos;t looked at these people as broken and profit , they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago i went to the town i grew up in a food market in the nor@@ the@@ ast of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was there in front of a p@@ inn@@ a of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania .
and it was summer , and i had a horse .
and i hear a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that wasn &apos;t ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i turn around , and i see this older man , and i didn &apos;t know who he is .
and i said , &quot; exc@@ use me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember her . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , well , you can &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw it , i went out of the bel@@ ly of her mother &apos;s bel@@ ly . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it &apos;s done butt@@ on .
that was dr. ke@@ an , a man i just knew from narra@@ tives of my mother about this day , because i obviously , of course , typical , had come to my birthday for two weeks .
the doctor for te@@ st@@ at@@ al diagno@@ stics of my mother was in vac@@ ation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not in .
and because i was born without the water@@ legs , and my feet were direc@@ ted , and i just had a few to@@ es of this and some to@@ es on the other foot had to be over@@ wei@@ gh@@ ing , this stran@@ ger had to change the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say to your parents that you &apos;re never wor@@ thy of running , and never so moved as well as other kids , or that you could never live an independent life , and since they pun@@ ished me . &quot;
now i saw really extraordinary that he raised exten@@ sion sti@@ cks of my entire childhood , whether i had won in a writing competition in the second childhood , whether i had won my sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship or one of my spor@@ es at te@@ lo@@ ween , whether i had my sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship or one of my ath@@ func@@ tions , and he used these cli@@ ps to teach his students , medical students from the ha@@ h@@ ne@@ man medical school and the her@@ s@@ hey of medical school .
and he called this part of his cur@@ ve the x factor , the potential of the human wel@@ f@@ are .
you can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze enough how substan@@ tially this will be for a human &apos;s quality of a human &apos;s life .
and dr. ke@@ an said on , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t get told anything else , and even if they get a little help , if you leave kids , children can achieve a lot . &quot;
you see , dr. ke@@ an has changed his thinking .
he understood that medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone could lead with it , are two different things .
and also , i changed my thinking over the time , if you asked me about 15 years old , whether i had covered my pro@@ s@@ thes@@ es against legs of meat and bone , i wouldn &apos;t have been a second .
i didn &apos;t want to act at that at that time .
if you ask me about this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this is what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not even this experience .
and maybe that transformation could also happen , because i &apos;ve come to so many people who have opened me do@@ ors , rather than fac@@ ing people who want to im@@ press me , or have a picture to me .
you see , it really takes one person to demon@@ strate to you how they can mani@@ fest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow it to activ@@ ate your own inner forces , the human mind is so re@@ com@@ men@@ ded -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you open a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them how to open up their own do@@ ors .
the actual meaning of the word &quot; the web &quot; cor@@ ses in the word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
it means to set up something that &apos;s potential to s@@ wal@@ low the potential .
again , what kind of potential do we want to call up ?
in the 196@@ 0s , the case study was condu@@ cted a case study , and then tri@@ m@@ by@@ asia was trans@@ formed across entire schools .
they call this &quot; exten@@ sion &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; dete@@ ction . &quot;
students are divi@@ ded to the gra@@ des .
and the a student is te@@ sted ni@@ cer , they get better teachers , and so forth .
they then gave students about a three mon@@ th-@@ long period of students with a &quot; enough , &quot; they told them that they were very smart , and after these three months , they were really written very smart , and
and of course , it pe@@ ak@@ ed to you the heart that the outside students were told , they &apos;re just suff@@ i@@ cient .
and of course , after the three months , it was also .
but only those that still were in school -- bes@@ i@@ des the students who had wi@@ ped school .
cru@@ cially , in this trial , the teachers were not shu@@ t .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that anything was changed .
they simply said that be the un@@ equal students , and that &apos;s the students and that are the students with the statistics , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real dis@@ ability is a broken mind who has been broken , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more powerful . he doesn &apos;t find our natural , chil@@ th@@ ful curi@@ osity , and our in@@ na@@ te ability of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human spirit to continue to find , to hope , to find itself and other people around them , to be more curious and to be curious and imag@@ ined our power@@ s , we really will reach positive positive .
if a mind has about these quali@@ ties , we can create a new reality and new func@@ tional forms .
i want to end with a po@@ em that was reve@@ aled by a per@@ si@@ an po@@ et called ha@@ fi@@ z in the 14@@ th century , and the po@@ em is called my friend jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot; &quot; each child knows only four words , not the god of the dic@@ tion , but the god who only knows about four words , he always said , come , dance with me . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re currently right now ?
now , suppose i said that by a few changes of your genes , a better memory could have a better memory -- pre@@ cise , more , and faster .
or you want to be ste@@ er , more stron@@ ger , have more power@@ s .
do they want to become attra@@ ctive and confi@@ dent ?
what would it be like to live in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of them that &apos;s always always known for more creativity .
which would you re@@ f@@ are the most ?
what would you like to have , if you could single have one or one ?
creativity is .
how many people would choose to choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably so many of us there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would op@@ te for a positive memory ?
well , a couple more .
what would it be about fit@@ ness ?
a few less .
what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
ah , the majority . i like to see , as a doctor .
if they could have just one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all occu@@ pris@@ ing ?
or is it possible we might be possible ?
evolution has been a similar top@@ ic here at the ted conference , but today i want to give you the opini@@ on of a physi@@ cian to the theme .
the great gene@@ tic@@ ist in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a develop@@ ess in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , wrote a paper , with the ti@@ tle , &quot; nothing in biology makes no sense except in the twi@@ st of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those that doesn &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn your audi@@ o , take your personal communic@@ ations -- i &apos;ll give you per@@ mission -- and maybe you can take a look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos;s book , which is that &apos;s to be wrong , because nothing in the long run on this talk will make you a sense of you .
but if you accept biological evolution , this is just about the past , is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it true for others , or is it possible to us ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of des@@ per@@ ation in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , all exi@@ sting objects on the optimis@@ es of these bran@@ ches in evolutionary terms succe@@ e@@ ded in evolutionary terms : they survi@@ ved it ; it has demon@@ strated its environment with fit@@ ness and strength
the human part of this bay , far at the end , is that we &apos;re most interested in what &apos;s most interesting .
we bran@@ ch from a common ance@@ st@@ or to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , maybe 20 or 25 different kinds of hom@@ ini@@ ds came from hom@@ ini@@ ds .
some of them came and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite separate from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , in the largest part , the fundamental mechanis@@ ms of our cells are pretty much the same .
do you realize that we can make use of it and the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteria , to produce the protein of the human insu@@ lin , which is used to treat diab@@ e@@ tics ?
this is not like human@@ ga@@ lin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemi@@ cally in@@ different of what comes out of the pan@@ cre@@ as .
and as we talk about bacteria , you can realize that each of us in our gut leads more bacteria than it leads cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , think if ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o questi@@ oned his self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful hospit@@ al-@@ friend@@ ly environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s hot , it &apos;s dar@@ k@@ ness , it &apos;s we@@ t , it &apos;s very powerful .
and you &apos;ll all wish to give you all nutri@@ ents that you could just wish to offer no effort on them .
it &apos;s really a easier path for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal break@@ through@@ s of un@@ inten@@ ded , je@@ od@@ ch to the ex@@ tent to the ex@@ tent .
but others , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria as well as they &apos;re important for their life .
they &apos;re helping with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um in a spe@@ z@@ us ?
or are we certainly being done something else -- something that maybe has been adap@@ ted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s step back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first evidence of living , maybe three to four billion years ago on the earth -- the first general organisms , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years -- and then the human species , which in the last 13@@ 0,000 years eventually , has been sha@@ ped .
in this huge un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life is just measu@@ red on earth , the animal king@@ dom , like a single ring ; and of human life , a little post@@ isi@@ zation .
so that was us .
this is also showing the entertain@@ ment value of this speech , so i hope , yes , i fell to love it
now , when i was a lat@@ re@@ ging in college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and the beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution in evolution , and i found something very fundamental : in most the existence of life in unique organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is continu@@ ing to be combin@@ ed in both to@@ ods cells .
but at the time , as a multi-@@ cell@@ ular number of organisms came up , things began to change .
you get sexual re@@ production into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of the sexual re@@ production , which is the genome , the rest of the body is em@@ it@@ ting .
in fact , one could say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of death of our bodies in evolution is at the same moment as the sexual re@@ production .
now , i should conf@@ ess when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reas@@ on@@ ably at that time , but with every year , it &apos;s gone to my growing dou@@ cles .
i &apos;ve managed to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , who introduced his show in las v@@ eg@@ as in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .
and one night , there &apos;s a p@@ is@@ se@@ ment on his hotel door .
so he op@@ ens the door .
before him , a gor@@ ge@@ ously named sho@@ w@@ boy is named sho@@ w@@ boy .
she looks at him , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
i came to the reali@@ zation as a doctor that i was working on a goal that was different than the obje@@ ctive of evolution -- not necessarily confli@@ cting , not very different .
i tried to preser@@ ve the body .
i wanted to keep sa@@ vor@@ ing .
i wanted to re@@ build the health after a disease .
i wanted to get that we have a long and healthy life .
evolution is about the pas@@ sing of the genome to the next generation , custom@@ i@@ zation and survive generation after generation .
from an evolutionary stand@@ point , you and i started like bo@@ ster rock@@ ets to send the genetic park into the next stage of the orbit , and then left it to the sea .
i think we would all be the mo@@ od , the al@@ dy allen recogni@@ zed , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do an im@@ mor@@ tal through my work .
i don &apos;t want to do it by dying . &quot;
evolution is not inevi@@ t@@ ably pre@@ fer@@ red to pre@@ fer the lon@@ gest life .
it didn &apos;t necessarily pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze the biggest , the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
evolution is communic@@ ated the creatures that pre@@ tend to fit the environment to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survi@@ vor and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that was the ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and so if fish were there , if fish were there , there would be vac@@ u@@ um fish coo@@ ked , so it could have been able to make a habit@@ ate environment there .
so , what does this mean when we look back , what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolutionary , and most of the way we predi@@ cted to the next stage , i would say that there is a number of possibilities .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to be continu@@ ing .
we have reach@@ ed some kind of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
and the reason that it would be that it was first by medicine , to get a lot of genes that would have been cho@@ sen , and it would have been re@@ moved from the population .
and second , we as a species have con@@ activ@@ ated our environment so that we &apos;ve managed to ada@@ pt to ourselves , and we have to ada@@ pt to them and we ada@@ pt to them to them
and by the way , we go and circle and we mix and b@@ ad@@ ble so much that they can no longer say that isol@@ ation is necessary , for evolution to find the status .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional species , of course , based on the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution are slowly ma@@ turing , but they are not min@@ d@@ ful .
and as far as the ger@@ es go , if we look at planets as a species , it &apos;s going to be insu@@ lation and the changes of the environment that might make evolution in a natural way .
but there is a third option , a deli@@ ght@@ ful , fascinating and sc@@ ary way of thinking .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led and determin@@ ed us as individuals in the choices that we make .
now , how did this happen ?
how could it be that we &apos;re doing that ?
let &apos;s just look at the reality that people today make decisions about their off@@ spring in some cultures .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the one and the family choo@@ ses .
so , let &apos;s think , if it could not only be allowed to ele@@ ct the sex of your child , but also to use that body in the body that would cure disease and prevent .
what if they could make the genetic shif@@ ts to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or elimin@@ ate weight of cancer risk or stro@@ ke acci@@ dents ?
would you really want to not want to make these changes in your genes ?
if we think , these kinds of changes will continue to be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took up 13 years .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the next year it finished in 2004 , they were able to do the same thing for 20 million dollars in either a year or four months .
today , you can complete a sequence of three billion base pa@@ irs of the human genome to a price of about 10,000 and up to the room of about 10,000 and a week of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long until the reality is going to be the 1,000 u.s. genom@@ es , and it &apos;s going to continue to be available for everybody .
a week , the national acade@@ my of engineering engineering awar@@ ded the dra@@ per prize for fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ mmer , two scientists who developed independent path@@ work to work faster and to wearing for des@@ per@@ ate proteins in a efficiency -- that fran@@ ce ar@@ n@@ old &apos;s &quot; direct evolution &quot; res@@ on@@ ates .
a few years ago , the las@@ er prize president sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a vot@@ ed for his research in which he took a company of skin , a fi@@ bro@@ bla@@ st , and through the manipu@@ lation of just four genes that infe@@ cted cell to bring them to a plu@@ ri@@ po@@ tent stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially can become any cell in your body .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that makes the human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that not only prote@@ cts itself from itself but also to the imm@@ unity for other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study in the form of v@@ acc@@ ine against influ@@ enz@@ a , that was built into the cells of a to@@ dd@@ stream .
can you think of something good that &apos;s going to get out of to@@ bac@@ co ?
this is all reality today , and in the future it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
now , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if they could change the cells of their des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts ?
what if they could change the sper@@ m and the eg@@ g , or the fresh bur@@ den , to give their children a better chance for a healthy life -- elimin@@ ating diabetes , re@@ move the cro@@ m@@ li@@ li@@ ty , reduce risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be heal@@ thi@@ er kids ?
and then the analy@@ tical technology , the same engine of science that can en@@ able change to prevent disease , could also allow us to adop@@ t ever@@ -@@ of-@@ law at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capacity -- the better memory .
why not the ste@@ wing order of a twitter indi@@ l , especially if you can bro@@ aden it with the next generation of the wat@@ son machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ ber that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer life live ?
these are going to be un@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able .
and if we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want , we &apos;re going to be conver@@ ted by al@@ s-@@ style evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that is probably going to require 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it to thousands of years -- and maybe even in the next hundred years .
these are choices that have to deal with your grand@@ children , or your grand@@ children to deal with .
are we going to use these decisions a society that is better , the more successful , the more friend@@ ly ?
or are we going to choose sel@@ ol@@ ci@@ vely different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want to have for some of us , and not for other of us ?
are we going to shape a society more becoming more red@@ und@@ ant and more uni@@ form@@ ated , or ro@@ sy and diver@@ si@@ vely ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
and the deep@@ est of all , are we going to be able to do the wisdom , and speak the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to make these choices ?
in good or more , than you may think , these decisions are going to lie on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine , now , a port@@ able robot that gives you human human skills , or another , the wheel@@ chair workers to stand up and stand up and go up .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics , we call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
they &apos;re nothing else than something that you put in the morning , and which gives them extra strength , and that will continue to increase their speed , and it will help you to main@@ tain your balance .
that is indeed the true shift of human and machine .
but not only that -- mel@@ ting and conne@@ cting with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers , who are wearing about 100 pounds on his back , and there is the question that they should wear more ge@@ ar .
of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- spin@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of it -- chr@@ onic re@@ in@@ ol@@ e@@ ments .
so we thought we &apos;d take this challenge to and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introdu@@ ce you to h@@ ul@@ c -- or human@@ -@@ ear@@ ning photo@@ car@@ rier .
sol@@ d@@ at : with the h@@ ul@@ c@@ -@@ ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can wear 200 pounds over different ter@@ rain , many hours of time .
his flexi@@ ble design allows us to cal@@ m deeply deeply , to warm and to create very , very agi@@ le mov@@ ements .
it makes what i want to do , where i want to go , and then raise my strength and per@@ sever@@ er .
we &apos;re so far to imagine with our industrial part@@ ners this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on this year .
so that &apos;s the true thing .
now , let &apos;s fit our eyes on the wheel@@ steps of paper , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 6@@ 8 million people , who sit in the wheel@@ chair in the wheel@@ chair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the over@@ all population .
and that &apos;s actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
we &apos;re often talking about young people with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury that in the sl@@ lon@@ ing of their lives -- 20@@ under , &apos; 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- was stru@@ ck by dest@@ in@@ y , the wheel@@ chair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , which is multi@@ pli@@ ed .
and it &apos;s pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a brain trick , or other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since his , which i have to say , very successful introdu@@ ction
so we thought that we could start to write a completely new chap@@ ter in mo@@ bility .
let me introdu@@ ce you to bee@@ anda , who was car@@ ried by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel , who suff@@ ered a spin@@ al justice in@@ j@@ ury in 19 years ago , issu@@ ing that she could no longer walk for 19 years and so far .
thank you very much .
like i said am@@ anda , am@@ anda is our chi@@ be .
it &apos;s got sensor@@ s .
his u@@ tter@@ ly non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s in the cor@@ ds that send signals back to our on@@ bo@@ ar@@ d computers that &apos;s atta@@ ched to here on their back .
here also is bat@@ ter@@ y pac@@ ks , the motor@@ -@@ drive is on your hi@@ p , as well as on your k@@ ne@@ es that are moving forward in this pretty smo@@ king and very natural ge@@ g@@ gles .
i was 24 years old and in the top form , when a mon@@ og@@ nant p@@ ar tree wh@@ ell@@ ed me during a ski@@ ra@@ ce .
in the fra@@ ction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my be@@ ck@@ ens .
not long after step a doctor in my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;re never going to go back . &quot;
and this is 19 years ago .
he sta@@ irs every five hop@@ es from my consciousness .
adap@@ table technologies have been possible to me since then to learn , to clim@@ b again , and to clim@@ b and even drive with the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back to me ti@@ ll now .
thank you very much .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet and to disc@@ uss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the entire potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the wheel@@ chair lo@@ ops , but for all .
thank you very much .
at home in new york , i &apos;m cha@@ wn of the develop@@ mental department of a non@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin &apos;s strength .
if i don &apos;t fight poverty , i &apos;m fighting as a fire@@ man &apos;s help on a volunte@@ er di@@ al in a volunte@@ er di@@ al .
well , in our city , in which volunte@@ ers spon@@ sor@@ ed a highly sk@@ ill@@ ed emotional fire , you have to be quite early at the ti@@ p to be able to share with you .
e@@ p : i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunte@@ er on the cli@@ b , so i had a fairly good chance of it .
but still , there was a race against the other volunte@@ ers to reach the man@@ ager man and to figure out what our tas@@ ks would be .
when i first found the main man , he was just in a very serious conversation with the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds who sur@@ ely had one of their worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the sle@@ eping bag and bar@@ e@@ foot under a screen out in the flo@@ wing rain , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunte@@ er who had arrived before me -- let him call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- got the main man first , and was asked to go to the house and save the baby of the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds .
the dog ! i was for@@ mer@@ ly proud .
there was some law@@ yer or cre@@ ator ste@@ wards , who now was now for the rest of his life , people could tell people that he went into a burning house to save a life , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the main man win@@ ds me to himself .
and he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up , and you have to get a little ring this woman , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i &apos;m swe@@ ating it .
now , not exactly what i was hop@@ ing to , but i went -- the sta@@ irs were up@@ sta@@ irs , turning along the hall@@ way , on the &quot; real fire@@ men , who at that point had finished so much , into the bedro@@ om to get a pair of shoes .
now i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i wor@@ e my pre@@ y back to where i met on the front door of my arch@@ my so and the belo@@ ved dog .
we car@@ ried our esti@@ ma@@ ts outside to the dom@@ esti@@ c state , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his far attention was more attention than i had .
a few weeks later , the fire@@ doctor got a letter of the hou@@ se@@ hold , where they wor@@ e the bra@@ ve operation for the res@@ cu@@ e of their house .
one of the things that is memor@@ i@@ zed kin@@ dness : somebody had even put a pair of shoes .
both in my career of ro@@ bin &apos;s brain and my close career , as a volunte@@ er fire@@ man , i &apos;m seeing gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness in lar@@ ge-@@ scale scale , but i also see the creation and the mu@@ ce of individuals .
and do you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around this room and see people that either reach@@ es a pen@@ it@@ able success , or on their way there , i want to offer them to the following memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in someone else &apos;s life until they &apos;ve reach@@ ed their first million a million .
if you have something to give , you &apos;ll give it now .
you put them in a sou@@ p kitchen , ti@@ p a park in the neighborhood .
be a ment@@ or .
not every day will be a chance to save a human &apos;s life , but every day we give us the opportunity to change one person &apos;s life .
so put it on ; let &apos;s save the shoes .
thank you very much .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mar@@ row , come back .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ve just come back from a community that knows the secret of the advan@@ c@@ ence of humanity .
a place where women lead the regul@@ ators , with sex &apos; hell@@ o , and the game esti@@ mate the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not buil@@ ds or san francisco .
ladies and gentle@@ men , their rela@@ tions .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jung@@ ter@@ ies of con@@ go .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s were with chimpanze@@ es with our clo@@ s@@ est living rela@@ tives .
that means that we have a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , ch@@ im@@ ps are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ves .
but unfortunately , we have this aspe@@ ct of over@@ stat@@ ement in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the me@@ d@@ al .
while chimpanze@@ es are led by big , sick , the bon@@ o@@ bo society is led by em@@ powered fe@@ ars of em@@ powered fe@@ males .
they really challen@@ ged what made it , because it leads to an extra@@ ordin@@ arily toler@@ able society , where killed by le@@ th@@ al violence has not been considered up .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least famous among the pri@@ mate .
they &apos;re living in the thi@@ ck of the con@@ gol@@ ese capital , and they &apos;re just hard to see the obser@@ vation .
con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the ar@@ ray of a violent argument that killed for decades and has led to so many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction also dan@@ ces the survival of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
meat performance and the re@@ ar@@ range of the c@@ ables it takes you that you may not even fill a sta@@ dium with the bon@@ led bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a contr@@ ast that the trees are sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing .
who are these rela@@ tives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; mon@@ keys , because they have common , even bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ble sex , with relationships part@@ ners , and rules so confli@@ cts and social issues .
now i don &apos;t say that would be the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because life of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s is more than the kam@@ a su@@ tra .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like people -- like to play their life for real .
play is not just ham@@ gam@@ s .
for us , and it &apos;s fundament@@ ally fundamental for the link of relationships and the care of toler@@ ance .
and with that , we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play ris@@ ing creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of behavior , diversity of behavior .
and if you look at bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the game , you see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human sal@@ es , dance and sex@@ als .
play is the in@@ tent that inclu@@ des us .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique foot@@ out from the wil@@ der@@ ness .
first a ballo@@ game on bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ type -- and i don &apos;t think of foot@@ ball .
so what we see here is a young female and males in a tracking game .
take a look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of , &quot; she could put it in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
just i think it looks like it &apos;s more like it , right .
yeah .
so , sex@@ es are con@@ fer@@ red , both in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and in humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea of ide@@ ity with which to make new elements in play -- like the te@@ stes -- and also how the game invol@@ ves both trust and encoura@@ ges -- while at the same time , incredible fun .
but the game is a form trans@@ duc@@ er .
play is a sha@@ ch@@ der , and there can be a lot of shapes that some people are slightly quie@@ t , fan@@ t@@ asy , curious , curious -- maybe to discover the amazing .
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she plays pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful with water .
i think just as you play alone , we sometimes play alone , and we look at boundar@@ ies of our inner and ou@@ ter worl@@ ds .
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that makes us explore , and interact , and the un@@ expected connection that we create are the real nutri@@ tions of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insi@@ ghts , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s giving us us in our past and present .
but they also represent a myster@@ y for our future , a future where we have to ada@@ pt to growing challenges , through bigger creativity and prin@@ ting co@@ operation .
the secret is that the game is the key to this sk@@ ill .
in other words , play is our adap@@ t@@ ability jo@@ ker .
in order to ada@@ pt to a un@@ in@@ cess@@ able world , we have to play .
but are we going to do the best thing out of our play layer ?
play is not sil@@ ly . &quot;
it can be essential .
and for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , and people , equ@@ ally , life is not of teeth and cla@@ ws alone .
at the same time , if it seems like it &apos;s har@@ d-@@ wired game , then perhaps it
and so , my pri@@ mate hol@@ ders , let &apos;s take this gift of evolution and play together , while we re@@ discover the creativity of the cau@@ te@@ dness and the mar@@ ish .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pa@@ irs , in mi@@ d-@@ 197@@ 9 , exactly the same day , in the same moment , every single one of the baby -- okay .
so two pa@@ irs , every case of a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the stuff , because , if you &apos;re all trying to do the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , you can imagine that in a case the sper@@ m car@@ ries a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m , which hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m man@@ ages a x chromo@@ some that hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
both of them are reli@@ able , they &apos;re all sitting there .
we &apos;re coming back to these people later .
most of my activi@@ ties , i have two ha@@ gs .
bene@@ ath a hat i &apos;m talking to the story of an@@ atom@@ y .
i &apos;m a histor@@ i@@ cian , and in this case , i study people with an@@ atom@@ y -- is this human body , animal body , animal bodies -- eating with blood flu@@ ids with body concep@@ ts with body concep@@ ts ; how they thought about body .
the other hat i wear in my work is the activ@@ ist , as a perman@@ ent law@@ yer -- or , as i sometimes say , as an im@@ patient at@@ yer -- of people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have body types , to question social nor@@ ms .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are si@@ am@@ i tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with ad@@ minister growing -- people who were less than common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with inter@@ sex people whose sex at@@ yp@@ ic -- so people who are not showing the average male or female body guy .
and as a separate term , we can use the word of inter@@ sexu@@ ality for that .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality is in a lot of different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the characters of sex vari@@ ants that don &apos;t talk about the male or female standard .
in a case , you might have somebody with a x@@ y chromo@@ sand@@ on , and the s@@ ry gene on the y ch@@ om@@ o@@ silk leaves proto@@ b@@ ones that we all have f@@ ond sta@@ dium , grow to te@@ stes .
and that &apos;s why the te@@ stes ad@@ ds te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one in the fe@@ tal r@@ ani@@ ster@@ one .
but because this individual is missing for the re@@ cep@@ tors to dete@@ ct the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body does not respond to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and this is called and@@ ro@@ gen@@ re@@ cep@@ tor@@ -@@ de@@ fe@@ ct .
so a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but not a reaction to it .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more of a typical female course .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s educ@@ ated when she &apos;s moved .
but it mostly takes them to pu@@ gh pu@@ ber@@ ty and grow their brea@@ sts and generate , but they don &apos;t get their time until somebody gets to that , is a little different .
and they do some tests and find out that instead of ir@@ ani@@ ls and u@@ ter@@ u , they actually have te@@ sti@@ cles in it , and they have a y chromo@@ some .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually think that person could be a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have taught in our bodies something that you call ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ les .
they &apos;re in the back part of our bodies .
and the middle kid@@ kee@@ pers calcu@@ late and@@ ro@@ gens , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
most women , like i -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromo@@ som@@ es , but i think i probably don &apos;t , but i probably think i have the typical -- most women like i do actually speak of and@@ ro@@ gens .
we make ro@@ cking , and we talk to and@@ ro@@ gens .
the result is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was more ex@@ posed to a woman that was born more and@@ ro@@ gens than a woman who was born with te@@ it , and have a and@@ ro@@ gen re@@ cep@@ tor .
so gender is really complicated , more complicated , more than only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a matter of ways , you can be distribu@@ ted over all band@@ wid@@ th .
another example : a few years ago , i received the phone call of a year-old man who was born as a boy , as a boy , who had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , lived as man , and he just found that he had some o@@ ardo sti@@ cks and a u@@ ter@@ us .
he had an extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te side b@@ it hyper@@ b@@ ie .
he has x@@ x chromo@@ lines , and in the wom@@ b , his side kid@@ ne@@ ys were so highly active that they basically created a male hor@@ m@@ uni@@ um .
and as a con@@ sequence , their gen@@ it@@ als were mani@@ fest@@ alized , his brain was the typical male part of the hor@@ h spectrum of the horse spectrum .
and when he was born , he saw himself like a boy -- no one was doing something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was te@@ stru@@ ed in open@@ ly , that the doctors discovered that he was female in i@@ vi@@ al .
okay , just a quick example of a vari@@ ation of inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , they &apos;re developing something called o@@ 0 est@@ is , lin@@ ked with the o@@ gen@@ an pul@@ su@@ es of ho@@ d@@ tis@@ us .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so sex can occu@@ r in a lot of different vari@@ ants .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s a pe@@ ak@@ er , or si@@ am@@ ese tw@@ ins , whether it &apos;s inter@@ anthro@@ able -- of surge@@ ons who often are custom@@ i@@ zed to the nor@@ m , is not because it &apos;s for their physical health of advan@@ tages .
in a lot of cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
the reason that they often are done different kinds of sur@@ gical interven@@ tions is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
now , typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain an@@ atom@@ ic agre@@ ement is adap@@ ted with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is a woman , is to be a female identity ; to be a black person , suff@@ i@@ cient to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of your story .
so we have this terri@@ fi@@ cent simpli@@ stic idea .
and if we &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a body that &apos;s actually very different for us , that &apos;s actually conf@@ using us into these categ@@ ories .
so , in our culture , we have a lot of roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism .
and our nation is really based on a very roman@@ tic concept of individual discipl@@ ines .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , who are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve seen for most of my exc@@ it@@ ement , the south african sei@@ yer , ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ in ka@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , was challen@@ ged her gender in the world &apos;s capac@@ i@@ zing room in ber@@ lin .
a lot of journ@@ alists called me the question , &quot; what do you want to do that tell us is if ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is white or males ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journ@@ alists that there was no such test .
we now know that sex is difficult enough that we have to ad@@ mit that nature is not stre@@ t@@ ched between male and physi@@ cally , or between men and inter@@ sexu@@ als and wisdom and inter@@ sexu@@ ality , more care@@ ful , that we are it to the point that we have of course not to match this
so we have this situation , where the continu@@ ing of our science , we have to ad@@ mit to so much more that these categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve decided to build for stable an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories , which are very simple to create perman@@ ent identity produ@@ ctions to create perman@@ ent identity produ@@ c@@ tors , much less shar@@ p than we &apos;ve been taking .
and it &apos;s not just sex@@ y .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be a much more difficult than our ter@@ min@@ ology .
in our obser@@ fs , we tend to move in all kinds of in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent areas .
we &apos;re taking , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
what shall we begin to think about the fact that we &apos;re just different by little nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
as we continue to increase our science , we &apos;re increasingly beginning to get into a zone of embar@@ ras@@ s@@ ment , where we have to recognize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories that we have had some way to be simple .
we see it in all sorts of different real@@ ms of human life .
one of the areas that we see this to the right , in today &apos;s culture , in the united states , are the struggle of the beginn@@ ings and the end of life .
we have difficult conver@@ sa@@ tions about what &apos;s going to become a body to people , so he &apos;s got a different right than the fe@@ tus .
we have very difficult events today -- perhaps not as publi@@ c@@ ly in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors previ@@ ously had never been so hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
they had someone holding a fe@@ a@@ ther under the nose , and when they moved , they didn &apos;t bur@@ y them .
if they didn &apos;t raise it , they bu@@ ried them .
but today , we are in a situation where we take people of vi@@ tal organs and we want to lay out other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re thro@@ wing ourselves in the fight with the really difficult question when someone &apos;s dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation , where we don &apos;t have as simple categ@@ ories as we used to .
now you may sus@@ sure that all of the categ@@ ories of categ@@ ories would make someone really happy to make me happy .
i &apos;m pro@@ gressi@@ vely , poli@@ tically , i &apos;m defen@@ sive people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit , it makes me feel nervous .
knowing that these categ@@ ories are really much more inse@@ cure than we thought it was en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed to make me
and it &apos;s fascin@@ ated by thinking of reas@@ oning in terms of global terms .
so to tell you about that desire , i have to tell you about first that i &apos;m a big fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
i know they were ra@@ ti@@ on@@ ts , i know they were more sex@@ y , but they were great .
i think they &apos;re so bra@@ ve and strong , and so radical where , in what they were doing , i &apos;m going to see all of the sh@@ mal@@ tz@@ ish charles 17@@ 7@@ 6 &#93; in 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten .
it &apos;s because of what 17@@ 7@@ 6 has done with the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were in my view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why .
what they measu@@ red was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and they put it through another that was radi@@ cally and beautiful , and 200 years of meas@@ uring it .
as you all remember , our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers beat the concept of the mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was consi@@ stent on a very simpli@@ stic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
the world &apos;s fore@@ sts didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth on the ground .
they had a concept of blu@@ e-@@ blood .
they believed the notion that people who had political power should have this political power , because of the incredible blood line from the grand@@ father to the son and so forth .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers dec@@ lar@@ ed this idea and transl@@ ated it through a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all people became meaning@@ ful .
they ni@@ vel@@ ed the game field , and they decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , they coun@@ ted common , not the differences , and it was very radical .
now they made that part , because they were part of an el@@ ev@@ ate system where two things were growing together .
democracy grew in , but at the same time also scientific education grew .
if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , it &apos;s clear that many of you have been very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ alist world .
they went away from expla@@ in@@ ations of super@@ -@@ natural species , and they follow things , like a super@@ natural concept of power , where the trans@@ mission is based on a very va@@ va@@ ge concep@@ t of birth right .
they were moving to a moral concept .
and if you look at the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they managed to give us an idea that was designed by an@@ atom@@ ical diver@@ gen@@ ce .
and so , in a really wonderful way , they &apos;re prepar@@ ed to be prepared the future rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it as much , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened for years after this ?
for example , women used the vot@@ ing of vot@@ ing , the concept of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , who says that an@@ atom@@ ic common@@ ness is more important than the an@@ atom@@ ical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and ir@@ on m@@ ess as a difference not meaning@@ ful , that we should not have the vot@@ ed , the right to immedi@@ ate citi@@ zen@@ ship , the right of ow@@ ner@@ ship , etc . &quot;
and women were succe@@ eding that .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like so@@ y &apos;s photos that sp@@ mm , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the cham@@ bing hall@@ ings of the burn movement , saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
again , people of different skin color that are working on an@@ atom@@ ic diver@@ sity against an@@ atom@@ ic differences , again .
we see the same with the dis@@ ab@@ ling legal movement .
of course , the problem that , as we start to look at all the common matters , we have to start asking why we don &apos;t susta@@ in certain a@@ im@@ ings .
now , well-@@ consci@@ ously , i want to keep certain tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
i want to , for example , want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the an@@ atom@@ y very far .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-@@ ol@@ ds should have the right to be sex or to give re@@ ten@@ tive .
so there are some an@@ atom@@ ic op@@ posi@@ tions that make sense for me , and that we think i should stay .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we &apos;re paying them , and whether they &apos;re meaning@@ ful .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been viol@@ ated at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 197@@ 9 , at exactly the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , three months ago , she was born , so she was born on jun@@ e 19@@ 80 .
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born the eleph@@ ant , so he &apos;s born on the one mar@@ ch of 19@@ 80 .
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia was born three months of early , they got all the rights three months before h@@ ein@@ rich -- the right to have low sex , the right to choose , to drink the right , to drink the right .
h@@ ein@@ rich must wait for all this , not because it actually has a different biological age , only because of the time of time of his birth .
we find other od@@ ties of what their rights are .
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you assu@@ me that it &apos;s male -- even though i told you that he &apos;s male -- even though i don &apos;t tell you that it &apos;s male , he can now be put in , now he can &apos;t worry what mar@@ ia has to make .
mar@@ ia , without all states , can &apos;t percei@@ ve the same thing , the h@@ ein@@ rich in all states , and that &apos;s the right to mar@@ ry .
h@@ ein@@ rich can mar@@ ry a woman in each state , but mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman in a few states .
so we have these dur@@ able an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories that are proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able in many ways .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is such progress in an@@ atom@@ y , that we get a point where we have to ad@@ mit that a democracy that causes an@@ atom@@ y may emer@@ ge ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it still feels like science makes itself even the same way .
so where do we go here ?
it seems like our culture would interven@@ e a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic position , &quot; well , we have to pull a line somewhere , so we &apos;ll pull it out somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are dro@@ pped in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at a point decided that if a man is to mar@@ ry , you don &apos;t have y chromo@@ some , and to mar@@ ry a woman that you have a y chromo@@ some .
now in practice , people don &apos;t get te@@ sted for their chromo@@ some .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re , because of the history i started telling you about the and@@ ro@@ gen re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
when we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king off@@ ers us in his &quot; i have a dream &quot; a kind of a solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be ju@@ g@@ ged people to &quot; their skin color , &quot; but to ju@@ dge its character of its character , and go beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate people based on their person@@ ality ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure we should distribu@@ te rights in people , because i have to ad@@ mit that i know a series of golden re@@ tri@@ ever@@ s that probably deser@@ ves so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n benefits than some people i know .
i want to tell you that i probably know some bright lab@@ el lab@@ s , the more capable are more sophisti@@ cated , more intelligent and ri@@ fer decision with your sexual rela@@ tions than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that i &apos;ve known .
so , how do we em@@ a@@ tion@@ alize the question of the character of character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and part of me as@@ ks , what if the content of a person@@ ality would be something that would be in the future machine in the future -- is it going to be made through the f@@ mr@@ i visible ?
do we really want to go in that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leadership to think about questions about what democracy is .
in our ur@@ ge about democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing well , and i think we would do our thing in the future well .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for instance , as it &apos;s the case in iran , where a man who is sex@@ ually attra@@ cted to other men is pun@@ ished with death , it , unless he is ready to sub@@ stit@@ ute a food transformation , which is why he can stay alive .
because of this kind of species , we don &apos;t exist with .
i &apos;m gla@@ d to say that we didn &apos;t have this situation -- a surge@@ on with whom i spoke a few years ago , who had some si@@ am@@ i tw@@ ins with some si@@ am@@ i tw@@ ins to separate them , par@@ tly to make a name .
but when i spoke to him , and i asked him why he made these sur@@ ger@@ ies -- it was high ris@@ e sur@@ ger@@ ies -- was his answer that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and so he had to do it .
so i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve taken political as@@ yl@@ l instead of surgery instead of surgery to separate it ? &quot;
the united states provide exc@@ ell@@ ent opportunities to allow people to be that they were , without having to change the state .
so i think that , in fact , we have to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to find out that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fa@@ thers .
and i want to think about the possibility of how democracy might look like , or have looked at if we have more involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something that &apos;s radical for a fe@@ min@@ ist , and i think that there may be different ways of insi@@ ght that affec@@ ts different kinds of an@@ atom@@ y , especially when people are appl@@ ying a group thinking .
for years , for years , because i was interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i became interested in research in gender related .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and how they operate in the world .
what we have learned from culture studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- is almost everybody , but on the average -- more often , complex social rela@@ tions and the people who are vulnerable in the group to give very much attention .
and that &apos;s why when we think about it , we have an interesting situation to do .
years ago , when i was making a graduate student , i asked one of my class@@ mates who knew my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i looked at myself as a fe@@ min@@ ist , so do it still -- a really weird question .
he said , &quot; tell me what fe@@ min@@ ism is fe@@ it@@ al . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most au@@ min@@ ous question i &apos;ve ever heard .
fe@@ min@@ ism is about solving stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , so at fe@@ min@@ ism is nothing fe@@ tal .
but the more i thought about his question , so much so that i thought that there was a bit of female in fe@@ min@@ ism .
that means to have something , there could be something on average , where female brains of male difference that are paying attention to highly complex social rela@@ tions , and paying attention to the prote@@ cted needs for the pro@@ of needs
so where the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were extreme to find out how individuals could be prote@@ cted before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we interven@@ ed more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re fu@@ el@@ ing a concept , not just how to protect , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future when we do democracy about an@@ atom@@ y -- less about the individual body to think about what identity affec@@ ts , and thinking more about relationships .
so , when we try to make as people try a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public obs@@ ession , and that is : i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ its .
i love to find every chance of learning a different color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit , and also photograph@@ ing and blog@@ ging in time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i &apos;m going to get all my clo@@ th@@ es from second hand on fle@@ b markets and in the like hand@@ -@@ hand@@ -@@ sh@@ ops
thank you . thank you .
care@@ com sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the influence of my cou@@ poin@@ t@@ ment to the environment , and also to my wal@@ sa@@ ge .
i &apos;ll meet all kinds of amazing people , my consumer , for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to buy to my very personal mus@@ bing .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to have my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all of the answers yes , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i &apos;ll come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and tell me what i &apos;ve pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what do somebody make with so many of the out@@ f@@ its of it ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with .
i brought seven amo@@ unts of supp@@ res@@ ses , and that &apos;s all .
inter@@ se@@ cts for exactly one week are everything that i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case .
i &apos;ve bet that i would wear everything i might wear , if i came to pal@@ m spr@@ ings , just would i wear to pal@@ m
and because she &apos;s not listen@@ ed to me than the woman who &apos;s walking here at ted in her under@@ wear -- that means , i &apos;ve found a few things .
and i &apos;d like to show you my out@@ f@@ are for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i think you &apos;re actually learning or not , out of these ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ers , has taught nothing to contribu@@ te .
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
i call this the wh@@ el@@ ing tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look really great .
you can almost always look magni@@ ously for less than 50 dollars .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , has cost me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece that i had wear in this entire week .
mon@@ day : color is a little bit of a vi@@ cious .
it &apos;s almost physi@@ cally impossible to be mis@@ er@@ able when you wear a bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;ll reduce other happy people .
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ tation is going to be completely over@@ -@@ challen@@ ged .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in my life to try to be myself myself , and to ada@@ pt at the same time .
just be easy who you are .
if you surro@@ und yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand , you &apos;re going to esti@@ mate .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ h : are you fix@@ ing your inner child .
sometimes me , people say to me , i watched clo@@ th@@ es &apos; games or i remember them to remember their se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
i love to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : self-@@ confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking into something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not going to look in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me this day for day .
but it wasn &apos;t until i turned 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll sum@@ mar@@ ize that for you for a minute .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and exp@@ and@@ ing a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no exc@@ use for anyone in this audience .
we should be able to ro@@ ot what we want .
thank you very much .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : gold pa@@ il@@ ing fa@@ il@@ ing to everything .
and finally , satur@@ day : a self-@@ , unique , personal style , developing is a great way to tell the world a little bit about one , without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me whenever this week came up to me , just because of what i was wearing , just because of what i was wearing , and i had incredibly conver@@ sa@@ tions .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate this all again .
because the lesson i have this week to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to make these things emotion@@ ally , because right around the corner , it &apos;ll give you another crazy , color@@ ful , ra@@ w out@@ fit that just waiting for me when i have a little bit of love in the heart and it &apos;s looking for it .
thank you very much indeed .
thank you very much .
good after@@ noon , everybody together .
i have something that i would like to show you .
think of this as an ima@@ ging , as flying ima@@ ging .
this is what we call in our lab , per@@ cep@@ tual design .
so let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m origin@@ ally itali@@ an , and every young in it@@ al@@ y is growing up with this picture in his room , but the reason i show you this is that in the for@@ mul@@ a , in the last decades , something very interesting happened .
it was that , a while ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 , you took your budget , and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they would win the race .
so today , if you want to win a race , in fact , if you want to win , actually look at the car in real time , have some thousands sensor@@ s , the information from the car , that information comes out of the system , and then process it and then use it to send back to this car and change things in real time as information is colle@@ cted .
this would call you in engineering institutions , a re@@ al-@@ time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made from two parts -- a custom@@ i@@ zing part and a talking final .
what &apos;s interesting today is the real walking control systems begin to appear in our lives .
our cities have been equi@@ pped , just with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics in the last few years .
they become computers in the free .
and as a computer , they start to act in a different way , they start to act in other ways , they get stuck and re@@ pel .
when we make cities move , that actually is a big deal .
just by the way , i &apos;d like to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population exists there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy -- they gain up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something about the cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , pul@@ ling all of this sen@@ ds and gener@@ ating all this into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that &apos;s been organized pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i for mom@@ a later a year , in the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; she with me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , are beginning to speak to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om is going to be out there , a sen@@ sor and a pus@@ tain .
and that changes radi@@ cally the interaction that we humans have with our environment outside .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as though the old dream of m@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , as mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o sha@@ ped the mo@@ ses , it says that he took the ham@@ mer at the end , and she thre@@ w it on mo@@ ses -- they still can see a little spot on s@@ hal@@ low -- and said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you do you ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins for the very first time to respond to us .
i &apos;m going to show you a few examples -- again , to percei@@ ve the idea of our environment and provide .
let &apos;s start with that vision .
so the first project that i want to share with you is actually one of the first early of our lab@@ s .
it was developed four and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and what we &apos;ve done there was actually been used a new kind of network that &apos;s been put around the world -- this is a mobile tele@@ phone web and anony@@ ce and ag@@ gre@@ ch@@ ed information out of this network that already gather@@ es from the oper@@ ator to understand how the city works .
the summer , the summer was a happy summer , in 2006
it was when it@@ al@@ y won the soc@@ cer world c@@ us@@ p .
some of you may remember was , it was played as it@@ al@@ al for fr@@ ance , and then the zi@@ dan@@ e ends up , the head of the head .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won end at the end .
now , look at what happened that day , only during the obser@@ vation at the obser@@ vation of the activity .
here she is in the city .
you can see in the middle the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um , the flu@@ ver .
in the morning , before the game .
you can see the ti@@ mel@@ ine up up there .
once after@@ noon , people here and there , who are making the calls and move .
the game starts -- sil@@ ent .
fr@@ ance is doing a tor . it@@ al@@ y makes a ship .
hal@@ f-@@ time , people do a short call , go to the ba@@ th@@ room .
second half . end of the normal play time .
first impro@@ x@@ ima@@ dence , second .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in one moment of the head co@@ at .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
now , at that night , everyone went to the center to celebra@@ te .
they saw the big ex@@ pos@@ ure .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the docum@@ ent team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everyone went down .
you see the picture of the place to about co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since the ro@@ man time , people go to celebra@@ te -- to have a big party , and you see the impact at the end of the day .
now that &apos;s just one example of how we feel the city today , in a way , like we couldn &apos;t have done it a few years ago .
just very quickly , here &apos;s another example of it : this is not about people , it &apos;s about things that we consu@@ me and consu@@ me .
now , now we know everything about where we come from .
this is a map that you &apos;re showing all the chi@@ ps , which is a ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
so in this project we actually designed some little mark@@ ers to pur@@ sue the g@@ arb@@ age as it goes through the system .
so we started with a few volunte@@ ers who were , a little over a year ago in se@@ attle , helped tag@@ ging things that they wa@@ ped away -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they would throw back anyway .
then we have the little chi@@ ps , the little br@@ ands , bus@@ y pa@@ gs on the g@@ arb@@ age and start to follow it .
so here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve just got .
from se@@ attle ...
up after a week .
and using this information , we realized that there are a lot of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies in the system .
we can actually do the same thing with less energy .
the data wasn &apos;t available at all .
but that &apos;s what a lot of un@@ personal weather is happening and complicated things .
the other thing that we believe is that when we see that , if we see the c@@ up that we throw away , it doesn &apos;t just go away , they still don &apos;t disappe@@ ar anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re still sle@@ eping away every day .
and if we would show that to the people , then we can push a behavi@@ oral change .
so , that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my collea@@ gue , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , who , could percei@@ ve a lot more about that and the many wonderful things that you can make with , tell me , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we discus@@ sed in the beginning , and that &apos;s the em@@ ph@@ as@@ is of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in sam@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
it started with a ma@@ yo@@ r question , who came to us and said that spa@@ in and southern europe have a beautiful tradition in public places to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology , new technology to interact with ?
and one of the ideas that was repor@@ ted at mit was , they imagine these des@@ ks , and they imagine these des@@ ks , and val@@ ves , magnetic fuel val@@ ves , spe@@ ams that open and close .
it causes something like a water cur@@ tain with ima@@ gery from the image of water .
when these str@@ ands fall down , they can write on them , they can write patterns , images , text display .
and you can walk through it , and he &apos;s going to open up to let you see how you can see in this image .
now , we pres@@ ented the ma@@ yo@@ r bel@@ hole .
it really enjo@@ yed him .
and we got the mission to design a building at the built of the exp@@ o .
we called it the digital water of pa@@ car@@ li@@ on .
the whole building was covered out of water .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but when you approach him , it &apos;s going to open up and let it sit in .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s win@@ dar@@ y , if you want to lower the sy@@ ring@@ es , you can even rele@@ ase the roof .
or you could close the building and be able to close the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this day , when you go down the roof , get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building . &quot;
no , they don &apos;t destro@@ y the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappe@@ ared .
and here you can see the building working .
you can see the person what &apos;s going on inside what &apos;s going on inside .
and here , you can see me , when i was trying to test the sensor@@ ings of sensor@@ s that open the water , not getting we@@ t .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensor@@ s were listening to working .
but in fact , it was an even bigger fun at this time .
all the children from sam@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open it to let them , but a building that had still brea@@ ks and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting we@@ t .
and that was , for us , for ourselves , very exciting , because as architec@@ ts , engineers , as designers , we think about how the people who use stuff that we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always inno@@ va@@ stat@@ able .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with the people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical images display , the ima@@ gery of water and the proje@@ ctions on it .
and this is what led us to thinking about the model of the project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine this figu@@ d@@ der of ima@@ ging could really start flying .
imagine you could have little heli@@ cop@@ ters that fly through the air , and every one of you with a little center of the inter@@ faces with fli@@ ver light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
so here &apos;s the video .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter like the one you saw earlier , which moves with others , totally syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ zed .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble display or display , like this -- a compar@@ ical forma@@ tion in two dimensions .
or ir@@ regul@@ arly , however , in three dimensions , in which what changes is , the light is not the position of ima@@ ging .
they can play with different kinds of different .
imagine the screen could just appear in different forma@@ ts or hei@@ ght , in different resol@@ ution .
but then , then , all of a sudden you could be just a 3d cloud of images that you can go to and through which you can look through them from many , many direc@@ tions .
here &apos;s a real fl@@ y@@ whe@@ el controll@@ er that dro@@ ps down to form a very consi@@ stent operation .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so the same way we saw it before .
imagine that each one of the people is managed .
there could be every single object that could have a impul@@ se that comes from people , from the mov@@ ements of people or so .
i want to just show you something here first .
we &apos;ve worked with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the ga@@ box at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york , and sc@@ ala in mil@@ il@@ and -- we &apos;ve taken his mov@@ ements in 3d to use them as impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fir@@ es .
so here you see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you see the ima@@ ge-@@ shared images that are different .
it &apos;s simul@@ tane@@ ously a re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan and a controll@@ ing site .
so they can re@@ tali@@ ate the whole movement .
you can do it all the time .
but then , once we have all the images , they can play with it , and with color motion , and dra@@ g motion .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a potential impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fir@@ es .
i &apos;m going to show you the lat@@ est project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olymp@@ ics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , is imagine , imagine that we again assem@@ ble the people to do something and change the environment -- almost as what we call it , to build clou@@ ds around how to move a bar un@@ it@@ or , but with a cloud .
imagine that every little don@@ ation can give you a shot of a qu@@ est .
i think that the remarkable one of the marriage for the last several years , the last decades is that we &apos;re moving from a physical world to a digital world .
that has all di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , knowledge , and makes it acc@@ essi@@ ble through the internet .
today , we can for the first time -- and the campaign of admini@@ am@@ as has shown this -- we can change from the digital world , from the self-@@ organi@@ zing forces of networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that means something in the city is built .
but tomorrow can it to ask us the challenges -- think of the climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we then change from the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually integra@@ te the people in which they put things together , do something collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of images in the same way , in the same way that a cloud of particles is made of particles
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of ima@@ gery .
it &apos;s a physical frame@@ work in london , but photograph@@ ies covered with ima@@ gery .
they can move inside , and they can do different kinds of experience .
you can actually look at it from underneath , the most important moments for the olymp@@ ic 20@@ 12 and beyond it , and it &apos;s as a way of conne@@ cting to community .
so both of them , the physical cloud in the sky , and something on the top can go to , like sun@@ d@@ on &apos;s new meters .
you can walk into it .
and a kind of digital light at night -- but as most most important , a new kind of experience for anyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important with this context .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to tell that people are not separate from nature , and that everything is inter@@ connected .
the first time i was in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , i was in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ berg .
i re@@ main a@@ va@@ cure .
my heart ra@@ ste , i was thri@@ ll@@ ed , as i was trying to express what was going on before me .
the ice mountains around me were ra@@ ping 40 feet out of the water , and i could only hin@@ t that this s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke was on another s@@ no@@ wer lo@@ cket year after year .
ic@@ an@@ ts are born as cal@@ b of a gl@@ aci@@ er , or by blo@@ wn out of ice sh@@ ates .
each ice mountain has its own individual person@@ ality .
they interact in meas@@ ures to their surro@@ und@@ ings and their experiences .
some ra@@ kes are willing to give up and make clo@@ th@@ es to the bit@@ ter end , while others don &apos;t prevent it and don &apos;t com@@ promise in a fit of dra@@ matic passion .
when you look at a ice mountain , you &apos;ll think that &apos;s easy that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , separate and alone , just like we people see us .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a ice mountain mel@@ ts , i &apos;m tun@@ ing up his global atmosphere .
during the ice mountain , he &apos;s rele@@ ased glam@@ al-@@ cer@@ ric drin@@ king water that fe@@ e@@ ds a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my foot@@ age of these ic@@ e@@ berg as if i &apos;m doing portra@@ its of my ancestors , in the awareness that they exist in these individual ev@@ ening , and they &apos;re never going to be built like that again .
it &apos;s not a death , when you mel@@ ting ; it &apos;s not the end , but it &apos;s a continu@@ ation of their path on the life cycle .
some of the ice in the ice mountains that i &apos;m zo@@ om@@ ing is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures that i &apos;d like to show you is a ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;ve been photograph@@ ing in ke@@ ch@@ t@@ su@@ at@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
very r@@ ar@@ ely , you &apos;re actually going to paint a roll@@ ing ic@@ e@@ berg .
now here you see it .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you can see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg , and where it &apos;s on the water@@ line .
you can see here he starts to roll , and the boat moved to the other side , the man is there .
that &apos;s the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg .
it ra@@ ces about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is actually in real time .
and just like this , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different side of his person@@ ality .
thank you very much .
my life is really ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ably bl@@ essed by work on some amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est thing i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is en@@ vel@@ op@@ e .
pre@@ tend was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ sts in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
and then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs cri@@ ff@@ le . &quot;
and that was the er@@ up@@ tion of the day .
temp@@ t@@ fully , this is all completely paraly@@ zed .
now it can only use his eyes .
i was fac@@ ed with him .
i have a company that &apos;s doing design and anima@@ tion , so gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably a complex part of what we look and look at in the arti@@ stic world .
so we decided , tony -- let &apos;s support this thing -- and to support his issue .
i met with his father , and his brother , and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i &apos;m only going to talk to tony again .
i want to just go back to him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t it -- i &apos;ve seen ste@@ phen haw@@ king -- can &apos;t communicate all paraly@@ zed people through these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard to go to higher social class and have a remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , you can really do it .
ordinary people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i expla@@ ined , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &quot; bu@@ tter@@ fly and lower details ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how your fing@@ ers are working .
i mar@@ in@@ ated , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ic , how could this be ? &quot;
so i came out with the need to just put a check , and instead i instead , i rele@@ ased a check , which i didn &apos;t have the easi@@ est idea of how i resol@@ ved it .
i connected myself in place , and i direc@@ ted through his brother and his father -- and the words , my pro@@ pos@@ al , said , &quot; okay , my pro@@ pos@@ al is this : we &apos;re going to motiv@@ ate it a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that somebody who &apos;s carrying all this , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so , i spoke at a couple of months later at a conference .
i met these folks from gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on every single surface and then draw with a las@@ er poin@@ ter that identi@@ fi@@ es only the negative space .
so they &apos;re moving around and doing art instal@@ lations like this .
they say that all of the things that are up there are followed a life cycle .
it starts with gender , and then the sc@@ u@@ ven@@ ks come , and the bush re@@ a@@ ders , and most recently , people actually make art .
but there used to be a life cycle in their pres@@ entation .
so i went home and worked with my wife , and i had told her of everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if this technology is this technology that you can use to control your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that rate to ste@@ er a las@@ er , so that he can make gra@@ ff@@ iti again , it would be brilliant . &quot;
so that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of back and forth , we &apos;ve reach@@ ed some things .
first , we &apos;ve called the in@@ sur@@ ance the do@@ ors , and actually have gotten a machine for ta@@ ps that it can communicate with -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ k@@ ing machine .
that was un@@ belie@@ vable .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yo@@ da , because you &apos;re talking to him , or getting an email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so un@@ comfortable , this guy is incredible . &quot;
plus , we &apos;ve flo@@ wn seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally from all the cor@@ ners of the world -- literally from all ed@@ ges of the world -- with us home .
my wife , my kids and i went into the garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ti@@ sts and con@@ spi@@ ti@@ sts have taken our home .
many of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid to do this , and that we would re@@ cover , and we all came back and all the images on the walls would be gra@@ ff@@ iti .
but for over two weeks , we progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the beach team in ven@@ ice , my children were involved , including my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ win , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we bought on the be@@ ach@@ ing of ven@@ ice , a little bit of cop@@ per wire and a few stuff out of the construction market and the electr@@ on@@ ics .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , we put them out , put it on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s open -- you can build it yourself , we can build it , we can put the code free , the software you can down@@ load free .
so we have created a device that is completely fre@@ ely fre@@ ely di@@ stra@@ cted .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can be roll@@ ed .
no hospital is also a hospital .
all paraly@@ zed can actually communicate with his eyes alone with your eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to speed rooms .
and i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else , and this is his room .
there &apos;s now all this sha@@ p from the great ama@@ z@@ ement .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , no nu@@ mer@@ ism and done star@@ tu@@ ps , tony did for the first time again after seven years .
and this is an amazing image , because this is his life support system , and he looks out about his life support system .
we plu@@ g his bed so it can see outside .
we have a proje@@ ctor ad@@ ded against a wall of the par@@ king lot in front of the hospital .
and he first dre@@ w again , in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was in the par@@ king lot .
unfortunately , we also had to collapse into the par@@ king lot , so we were perfectly prepared as a part of the content scene .
so what he did at the end was he told us an email saying , &quot; for the first time in seven years , i wrote something .
i feel that i was drin@@ ked under@@ water , and finally somebody thre@@ w down and raised my head to brea@@ the so i can brea@@ the . &quot;
isn &apos;t that hyper@@ -@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
that &apos;s kind of like our ta@@ il@@ -@@ be@@ ater .
that kee@@ ps us at the meeting , and we continue to develop more and more .
and we have to improve much of it on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes out of a magic ch@@ art .
and someone who has one such arti@@ cal potential is deser@@ ves so much more .
so , we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
since then , we have all given all kinds of recogni@@ tion .
we won a few a@@ wards .
think , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve to do it .
it comes out of our own po@@ ckets .
so the field lines were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
arm@@ strong twitter began about us and then , in dec@@ ember , the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine told us the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine , as one of the 50 best inven@@ tions in 2010 , which was really great .
the cool@@ est of this is -- and this inclu@@ des the whole circle -- that this apri@@ l , the spu@@ l mo@@ ca in down@@ town down@@ town of los angeles , is called a exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; art of the studio . &quot;
and there may be so much the tou@@ gh@@ est repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives of the street art scene -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ ws -- all these boys are going to be there .
stac@@ ked is part of the show , which is quite re@@ lie@@ ved .
so basically , i &apos;m going to try to do something : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ we@@ da -- it was impossible at some time .
do it possible -- you &apos;ve all got here .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i had never done anything with exchange technology , but i just measu@@ red something and surro@@ unding me and surro@@ unded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the feet .
and that question should be subje@@ cted every single day in every single day when something looks at you that needs to do something that needs to do it , if not now , when then , who else ? and if not i , who ?
thank you very much .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably musli@@ ot@@ y-@@ covered a new book auth@@ or .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come to a scientist like this .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ ther , but no one has ever cho@@ sen farmers .
today i want to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations .
well , an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve dro@@ pped it somewhere .
you go around the block and take it out as a re@@ ar@@ us@@ sion .
this is a painting of a cir@@ cular .
one of my friends has done it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ es .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of what i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 6@@ 0s at high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the class@@ pi@@ g .
i was the person who was be@@ aten every week in the morning of the virg@@ ine@@ o , green and blue until a teacher saved my life .
they saved my life by giving me the toi@@ let in the teacher &apos;s room .
that &apos;s what she was doing .
so she did it for three years .
and i had to get away from the city .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and it ble@@ w me to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and then in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i found it important to record a work in aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call from this teacher , woman po@@ sts who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as an adult .
you can come to o@@ hi@@ o , and please come to o@@ hi@@ o with the guy that i know you found them happening .
and i should say that i have cer@@ e@@ al cancer , and i want you to stand for you . &quot;
now , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we cr@@ our@@ ned , and we knew that they needed to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
we found one for them , we brought them there , we took them around , and we gave up their family eight because it needed to be .
it was something that we knew to do .
and as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , she met into a box full of a@@ s@@ hes and was put into my hands .
what has happened was that the circle closed , it was become a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation i got was poin@@ ted .
the re@@ vel@@ ation is that death is a part of the life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i re@@ sted y@@ ours of y@@ ours .
and , you know , this part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that this has been mentioned today this many times .
he needs the same thing -- he needs , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving us these things .
thank you very much .
imagine a big explosion while they clim@@ b up to about 1,000 meters .
think of a plane full of smo@@ ke .
imagine a bubble program that can be called a click , a flas@@ h , a flas@@ h , a flas@@ h , a flas@@ h , squ@@ ack .
this sounds sc@@ ar@@ rying .
well , i had a unique place on that day ; i was sitting on 1@@ th .
i was the only one who could talk to the air@@ line .
so i looked at her the same , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ll have a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already organized the machine , and we didn &apos;t go so far away .
you were able to see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot was direc@@ ted the machine after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
it &apos;s ligh@@ ting the po@@ les .
so , imagine a no@@ is@@ y airplane .
and then he said three words -- the tou@@ ch@@ able words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; make all the sha@@ ke . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bri@@ dd@@ les .
i could see it in their eyes , there was wr@@ en@@ ch , life was to finish .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me that day .
i learned that there &apos;s anything different in a moment .
we have this live plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people that i want to make a hand , and it didn &apos;t work , all the f@@ ences i wanted to do , all the experiences that i wanted to do , and i never did .
when i was thinking about it later , a phr@@ ase that is , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is so far , and the person is there , i &apos;ll open it .
i &apos;ll never want to move something more in life .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , that goal , changed my life really changed .
the second thing that i learned that day -- and that was , when we blog@@ ged the george washington bridge , as a pretty bit of hair bor@@ ders -- and i thought , &quot; ge@@ ar , there &apos;s one thing i really re@@ gre@@ ts .
i have had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i sc@@ ur@@ red to become better in everything that i pal@@ e@@ aded .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my e@@ go room .
and i had the time when i was wa@@ sted for meaning@@ less things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , with my friends , to people .
and after that , when i got thinking about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfe@@ ct , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t mention myself with my wife for two years .
it feels fab@@ ul@@ ous .
i don &apos;t try to have a right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this time , when the inner clock institute , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; ... &quot; down .
you can see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please sho@@ ot in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break up in 20 parts , as you know from docum@@ ent@@ ary .
as we fell down , i had this feeling of man , to dying , is not terri@@ fying .
almost as though we &apos;re prepar@@ ing to do it in our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sa@@ dness really was transl@@ ated in a thought , that i only wi@@ sh@@ ed for me one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after after@@ wards , i &apos;m atten@@ ding my daughter -- first gra@@ ders , not a lot of arti@@ stic talent ...
... that &apos;s not yet .
and i &apos;m cr@@ ying , i &apos;ll fire like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was a sense for me .
i realized that it was recogni@@ zed then by putting the dots together , that it &apos;s only about a great dad .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal of life , to be a good par@@ ent .
i became the mira@@ cle that was not going to die that day .
i got another present , which was to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to all of you who are flying today is : imagine what &apos;s going on on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it ; and guess it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that you cut up , because you think you &apos;ve always been there ?
how would you change your rela@@ tions and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , you are the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the sta@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want the iran to build the bom@@ b .
the most important pop there for the development of nuclear weapons is the ur@@ ani@@ an in@@ spir@@ ing institution in or@@ ance .
the gra@@ y bo@@ xes that you &apos;re seeing here , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
so if we &apos;re going to com@@ bine the systems that are controll@@ ing clu@@ bs and val@@ ves , then we can actually give a lot of problems to do with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
these gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can make it that a more effective win@@ d-@@ looking virus on a laptop that &apos;s used by a volunte@@ er engineer to con@@ fabri@@ cate this gra@@ y box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and that &apos;s the design behind the stu@@ x@@ net .
so we &apos;re starting with a win@@ dow@@ -@@ like threat .
the production data are trans@@ fer@@ red into the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ging the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the ir@@ ani@@ an power program -- mission ac@@ qu@@ is@@ red .
it &apos;s a car game , isn &apos;t it ?
i want to share with you how we found that .
when we started to stage our research six months ago , six months ago was completely un@@ known of what the purpose and pur@@ pos@@ e of this con@@ struc@@ tor was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the hun@@ ter part , the vent@@ ri@@ dge part , he made entirely no bil@@ o@@ w da@@ y@@ - &apos; sa@@ kes .
and it seemed to be something that appe@@ ared with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , this re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
that raised our attention , and we started a lab project in which we infe@@ cted our environment with sta@@ x@@ net , and we studied this built .
and then something bizar@@ re happened .
sta@@ x@@ net came out like a lab that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- sho@@ ot his che@@ ese , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense in my eyes .
and after experim@@ enting with different kinds of che@@ ese , i went forward to know that this was a commercial attack .
completely lin@@ ked on a particular target .
the dro@@ p is active on the gra@@ y box , when a special con@@ figu@@ ration was dete@@ cted , even when the special program that &apos;s been dete@@ cted it is trying to focus on this target .
and if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s not going to be st@@ x@@ net .
so , this one really caught my interest , and we started working with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could , say , can we be , for example , a u.@@ - 90 power station , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we have to get better at what the target is .
so , extra@@ cted and de@@ com@@ press the attack , we found that it was struc@@ tured in two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they built very profession@@ ally , by people , who obviously had all the inside of the inside information .
they knew every single bits and by@@ by@@ d that they had to attack .
they probably knew they knew the sho@@ e si@@ zes of the machine contain@@ ers .
so they were all known .
and if you &apos;ve already got the dro@@ ps of sta@@ x@@ na complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , the user data are a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisti@@ cated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen before .
here you see a clip of this attac@@ k@@ ie code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like old mo@@ di@@ ly un@@ condi@@ tional language .
and i want to share with you how we were able to be smart from this co@@ co@@ st .
so , having looking at what we &apos;re looking for , systems are lab@@ el@@ ing , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
and then we look for ti@@ ma@@ ts and data , and try to connect this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these tar@@ gets that we could repli@@ cate or dis@@ placed or dis@@ coura@@ ged .
so to make these theor@@ ies , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely a high s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it has to be a high-@@ quality target , and it &apos;s very likely in iran , because there have been most infe@@ ctions in iran , because there were most infe@@ ctions in iran .
well , in this region , there are not several thousand tar@@ gets .
in effect , it goes out to the bay volu@@ nuclear power plants and on the ur@@ ani@@ um v@@ it system in tri@@ ma@@ tion .
so , i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; take me a list of all cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ts and power plants from our cli@@ ent . &quot;
and i called them and i ta@@ sted their knowledge to describe their exper@@ ti@@ se with the what we analy@@ zed in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , we were able to connect the little digital out@@ turn with the cei@@ ling controll@@ er .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of this ro@@ tat@@ ing , you can actually actually kno@@ ck the ro@@ tor , and eventually even elimin@@ ate the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
and what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slowly and not have it happen -- obviously in the trying to let war@@ ware engineers des@@ f@@ end , so they don &apos;t seem to be able to get behind it quickly .
the big digital explo@@ head -- we got a look at it by looking very pre@@ cis@@ ely data and data structures .
so , for example , the number 16@@ four text looks very much out of this code ; you can &apos;t see it .
i began to work with scientific liter@@ ature , about how this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge gets built in laboratory , and found that they &apos;re struc@@ tured in what &apos;s in what &apos;s called cas@@ in@@ ca@@ des , and every car@@ bon@@ e con@@ tains 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ts .
so , that made sense , it com@@ bine .
and it got better than that .
this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ re in iran is divi@@ ded in 15 called the levels .
and guess what we found in the code of the ang@@ ak@@ er ?
it &apos;s an even iden@@ tical structure .
so , again , the fit@@ test really well .
and this gave us great confidence for the one that we studied .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
these results were achie@@ ved by several weeks of hard work .
and often , we just ran into a bot@@ t@@ len@@ e@@ cker and we had to re@@ collect ourselves .
anyway , what we found is that both digital war@@ heads were actually head@@ ing toward one and the same target , but from different direc@@ tions .
the little flas@@ head takes over a dung c@@ attle , and it conver@@ ts the ro@@ tors and slo@@ ws it down , and the big explo@@ ge is with six cau@@ li@@ es in interaction and decisi@@ on-@@ me@@ bes .
so , in a lot of , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we really have defined what the goal is .
it &apos;s or@@ ant@@ ance , and it &apos;s just or@@ an@@ tee .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets could be hit by stu@@ x@@ net .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- got me out of the so@@ cks , like this .
there &apos;s the gra@@ y box , and up at the top , you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
now , what this thing does is it takes the lo@@ cated values of sensor@@ s -- so for example , of tou@@ sor sensor@@ s and vi@@ br@@ ating sensor@@ s -- and it sets legi@@ ti@@ mate code that still is running during the attack , with the wrong data .
and actually this fal@@ se data of data has already taken place of stu@@ x@@ net before .
so it &apos;s just like hollywood movies where the sur@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce is where the fore@@ sts are f@@ ed with recor@@ ded video recor@@ dings with some pa@@ ke video recor@@ ds .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea here , of course , is not just to monit@@ or the motor operating user in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
the idea is to over@@ look a digital security system .
we need digital security systems there , where a human machine service can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power plant , for example , if the great ste@@ am tur@@ bine becomes too quick , you have to open de@@ for@@ est@@ ing sta@@ tions within milli@@ seconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
so this is what we need to do digital security systems .
and if the threat is , then really bad things can happen .
the power plant starts to explo@@ de .
and nei@@ ther the machine leaders , or the security system , will notice it .
that &apos;s fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
but it gets worse than it gets .
and what i &apos;m talking about now is very important .
think about it . this attac@@ ks is gener@@ ic .
it doesn &apos;t have anything specifically with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , for ur@@ ani@@ an en@@ han@@ c@@ ement .
so , for example , it would work exactly as well -- in a power station or in a car factory .
it &apos;s gener@@ ic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the ow@@ ner -- you don &apos;t have to get the use data over a us@@ b@@ - key , like we saw it in rich@@ x@@ net .
you could also use regular wor@@ m@@ asy technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you end up with a cyber@@ -@@ mass prop@@ ought wea@@ pon .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest percentage of goals is not for these attac@@ ks in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states , in europe , and japan .
so all of these green regi@@ ons , these are the most tar@@ ble environments .
we have to figure out the consequences , and we have to start pre@@ vent@@ ing ourselves .
thank you .
i &apos;ve got a question .
r@@ al@@ ph , it became a lot of it repor@@ ted that people believe that the mo@@ s@@ zz is behind the main organization .
so is that important to your mind ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . all right .
in my opini@@ on , mo@@ s@@ ma involved , but the driver &apos;s force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is cy@@ ma@@ -@@ super@@ power .
there is only one and this is the united states -- fortunately , lucky .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for bre@@ eding us a cure . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
i spent the last couple of years building into situations that are usually difficult and also a lot dangerous at the same time .
i went to ja@@ il -- hard .
i &apos;ve worked in a coal min@@ ing -- dangerous .
i &apos;ve been fil@@ ming in war -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i particularly have the majority of my career subje@@ cting to terrible situations , and it &apos;s all just for trying to explore social practice so that they &apos;re comp@@ elling and interesting , and hopefully reas@@ oning in a way of understanding what they &apos;re enjo@@ ying for the audience and being entertain@@ ing .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew that i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard of it that i jum@@ ped an ad on e@@ bay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent some facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter news , and i gave people the possibility to stand up to my ted@@ talk in 2011 to my ted@@ talk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris ander@@ son is never going to leave back -- the name of the talk to the talk that you &apos;re just looking at , that wasn &apos;t a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence to explain what the subject would be like .
so what you got was , you said , you name : my ted@@ talk , which you have no idea what the subject is going to be , and who ever goes to you after in@@ cen@@ ting your company , especially when i carry their company around for their invol@@ vement .
but apart from it , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these ted@@ talks ?
a huge amount .
by the way , this is just the successful el .
so , despite that cli@@ ren@@ cy , i knew that anybody would buy the name of ou@@ ter rights .
if you had asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say to you that with certain@@ ty .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , which is adverti@@ sing .
as i said , i had been in some pretty awful situations in the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could have me , to go on something as difficult and as dangerous as with these guys to a room .
you know , i &apos;ve had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is to do a film about brain stimu@@ lation , marketing and adverti@@ sing , which fund@@ ed the entire film is fund@@ ed by radio components , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
and the movie will be called &quot; the star wars of the film . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the star world &quot; is that everything , from above to bottom , is that everything , from the beginning to the end , is fully with br@@ ands -- from the eleph@@ -@@ spon@@ sor@@ s that you &apos;re going to see in the film , that &apos;s mar@@ k x .
now this brand , the qu@@ al@@ -@@ com@@ graphic sta@@ dium , the sta@@ ir@@ y center .
these people are going to be connected to the film in forever -- forever .
and so , the movie becomes explor@@ ing this whole idea -- this is what ? in the e@@ ter@@ us , for always ?
i &apos;m a red@@ und@@ ant person .
that was more about em@@ ph@@ as@@ is .
it was &quot; in e@@ ter@@ e@@ dness , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the mar@@ k x as a user spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible categ@@ ory in the movie .
so maybe we &apos;re selling a sho@@ e , and he &apos;s going to sell the most great sho@@ e you ever wor@@ e ...
the great car that you &apos;ve ever gone from , out of &quot; the stars of the greatest drink , &quot; the greatest drink that you have ever had , is a remin@@ der of &quot; the stars of the bottom of the henry . &quot;
so the idea is , bes@@ i@@ des show that brand is a part of life , are actually to elimin@@ ate them to fund the movie ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
so the goal of all this film is transpar@@ ency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of the film .
so , that &apos;s the whole concept , the entire film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy if ce@@ g would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know what en@@ de@@ ver@@ si@@ fied people are going to be .
you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; point &quot; because that has a deep con@@ not@@ ation -- but you know how it &apos;s going to evol@@ ve ?
how much money is going to need to realize that ?
one hundred and a half million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth any value to address some really known brand br@@ ands .
who knows , when the movie comes out , we might see kind of a hor@@ rier of vol@@ li@@ di@@ ots .
so what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is probably going to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing because of the film or a hard thing about me ?
j@@ k : both of them .
... ... so , it means , not so optimi@@ stic .
so , my mr. sir , can you help me ? i need help .
so i can help .
all right .
great .
we need to think about what are the br@@ ands .
ye@@ p .
when you look at the people whom you have to do to do it .
there are some places that we can turn to .
look at the camera .
i thought , &quot; take the camera out of , &quot; would it mean that we wanted a back conversation .
it turns out that it was actually meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so disappe@@ aring all of these companies , one after the other .
no one wanted to have something to do with the film .
i was ast@@ on@@ ished .
they didn &apos;t want to have nothing to do with the project .
and i was conf@@ used , because i thought the whole idea , the idea of adverti@@ sing , was to present as many people as possible , to allow them to see so many people as possible .
particularly in today &apos;s world , on this interface of new and old media and the dis@@ connected media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting repres@@ entation of repres@@ entation that the mas@@ ses will get this message .
no , i thought what i was thinking .
but , you see , the problem was that my idea had a f@@ at@@ al mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , it was not the mistakes at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this image is here , is a problem .
see , if you put transpar@@ ency in google search , that &apos;s one of the first images -- this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i like your kind , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now .
that was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free from de@@ ception and bubble , just to discover and push through , immediately sav@@ ings by visi@@ ability and access to information , especially what business redu@@ ction is -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transpar@@ ency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ce@@ os say it .
but if it comes to the metal , it &apos;s something to be imple@@ mented .
but why ? now transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ared of fear -- like this strange bear , which is still rock@@ eting .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this strange urban road .
and she &apos;s very ris@@ ky as well .
what else is it going to be ris@@ ky ?
a whole sna@@ p cool sin@@ k .
it &apos;s very ris@@ k@@ ant .
so when i began to talk to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father got caught at lying -- and he &apos;s sitting there looking at this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three ver@@ sions . &quot;
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there is the real version . &quot;
so , you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there was only a company ready to help us -- and this is also because i john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ t@@ tree heard for years -- i realized i &apos;ve had to do it alone , i realized i had to deal it alone , i had to deal the middle man and directly with my team .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you started talking to these companies , was that when you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand was understood , is a universal problem .
i have friends , the big , huge hollywood movies , and i have friends , the little prototyp@@ e movies , like i do .
and my friends , the great , giant hollywood movies make , say that the reason they &apos;re so successful is on the mar@@ sa@@ tions that they have .
and then my friends , the little web movies , they say , &quot; well , how are we going to compe@@ te with these big , giant hollywood films ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the bas@@ -@@ bas@@ son . &quot;
so , how exactly are we going to see phili@@ in the movie ?
every time i go on the way , and whenever i open the medical career , you &apos;ll see a fire@@ de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
and every time i intervie@@ wed somebody , i can say , &quot; are you enough to interview this interview ?
are they out there ? they &apos;re looking a little nervous .
i &apos;m going to help you to cal@@ m .
so maybe you want to put a little bit of this in front of an interview . &quot;
and then we make one of these gran@@ dio@@ fi@@ d@@ ds .
either fl@@ ame fusion or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise wind , &quot; you &apos;re going to have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be dis@@ solving both for men and women -- soli@@ d , wheel@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short fra@@ ge .
now , i can answer all of your questions and you give them a more specific copy .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve spo@@ ken about the smaller movies , we are an challen@@ ging an challen@@ ging .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other br@@ ands .
so to do these things -- you know people who are in ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
who do you think they would be in office ?
ban a be@@ k .
that &apos;s a great question .
it &apos;s over@@ wh@@ el@@ med technology .
technology is not the way to describe anything that does something that somebody under the watch .
we &apos;re talking about coo@@ ke@@ et , fresh .
i think &quot; gay &quot; is a great word that this categ@@ ory really makes to a positive positive , as op@@ posed to &quot; fighting gra@@ ve and mo@@ i@@ di@@ ty . &quot;
it kee@@ ps you fresh .
how can we hold them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more cold .
there are a positive effect of these things .
and this is a milli@@ onic manufac@@ tur@@ er .
what about me ? what about the prin@@ ting stick fa@@ ke ?
i have to speak with the man in the street , who are like me , ot@@ eless consum@@ ers .
you &apos;ve got to tell me something about my brand .
how are you going to describe your brand ?
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
e@@ z@@ ra : i don &apos;t
i really like to love beautiful clo@@ th@@ es .
8@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val hits on sk@@ ate sc@@ ert , except on the was@@ h of the was@@ h .
all right , what is the ger@@ ry ger@@ ry ?
un@@ belie@@ vable .
i think the gen@@ re , the style i have , is probably &quot; elle glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of gra@@ y noise and stuff like that .
but usually i usually have a ac@@ id , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and such a stuff .
if dan were a brand , he would probably have a classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ des of laun@@ ches .
i &apos;m , the brand i am , the brand i am , make it , poor fly .
part # two hi@@ pp@@ ie , in part of yo@@ g@@ i , in part broo@@ kl@@ y@@ e-@@ girl -- i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m the ch@@ a guy . i &apos;m the big guy .
i sold diagra@@ es all over the country , around the world .
so , i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , de@@ stor@@ ted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x , because i was an a@@ kee@@ cer .
guy five : scri@@ p@@ ted un@@ written al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ ctive scri@@ ps .
is that what ?
law@@ yer : i &apos;m a law@@ yer sign .
i &apos;m sym@@ ma@@ cked .
now , we can all be the tom@@ b brand , but i &apos;m often seeing me at the inter@@ faces of fully glamour and ear@@ l@@ able flight .
and what happened was that i need to have a choice .
i needed somebody to go in my head , somebody who could really help me understand what &apos;s called the brand person@@ ality .
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ oll@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
they have helped companies like nest , fe@@ at@@ u@@ es , hall@@ p , to find these brand characters .
if they could do it for them , they could also help me .
you brought your images with , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first image is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how it &apos;s connected with your thoughts and feelings about you .
these are the people who are designing my world@@ view .
just tell me about this world .
m@@ d : this world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- like people around one around of you , the friends , the family , the way how you live your life , the work and so on .
all these things came from a place , and they start from a place , and for me , and they start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what &apos;s going on in what &apos;s adap@@ t@@ ful to the thought and emotions about you ?
it &apos;s as i &apos;d want to be .
so i like things that are different .
i like things that are que@@ od@@ ble . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what is it that brings it to us
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ te ? what is the pu@@ p@@ pet ? what pu@@ p hori@@ tory is
why is it important to re@@ boot ? what does the red represents ?
let &apos;s tell you a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them that they are not .
which one of me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ tics have you gone through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be sc@@ ared . what kind of ach@@ er@@ op@@ on do you think ?
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ a@@ e ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your pati@@ ence .
yeah . all right . okay .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what is going to get out of this .
there were a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that your brand person@@ ality characters separ@@ ated two , but adap@@ ted pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ur@@ lo@@ ck dol@@ is a ven@@ ak of a ven@@ ak / story .
the inter@@ fer@@ ments are very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a conflict with it .
and i think some companies will only focus on soli@@ d strength , rather than both of them .
many companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- avoid things where they &apos;re not sure where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to fear , these elements , and they &apos;re wel@@ going to them for themselves , and they turn it into a little positive , and that &apos;s a ni@@ ck@@ y jo@@ ke .
what other br@@ ands are doing this ?
the first one is a classi@@ c , apple .
and you can see it here also , pain@@ tors , wi@@ i , min@@ i of min@@ i co@@ op@@ er and je@@ t@@ blue .
well , there are br@@ ands and mountains , mountains and wal@@ ks , these things that come and go , but a sta@@ w , and min@@ d-@@ num@@ ber@@ ed brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a el@@ ev@@ ate , ha@@ king brand . what &apos;s your brand ?
if anyone would ask them to describe their brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would it be ?
you &apos;re an up@@ -@@ brea@@ thing ? are you what the blood is going to get in walls ?
or are they more like a down@@ -@@ whe@@ el ?
are they something that a bit quie@@ t , more ste@@ wer , more conser@@ va@@ tive ?
up@@ and at@@ tribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ful , fresh like the foot prin@@ ce , time , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , de@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , dro@@ pped and fun , as enth@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n , wor@@ th@@ and agi@@ le , prof@@ it , magic , my@@ sti@@ cal and my@@ sti@@ cal and my@@ sti@@ cal , as que@@ up .
or are they more like a down@@ -@@ whe@@ el ?
are you min@@ d and mon@@ den@@ n like 100,000 ?
are they multi@@ pli@@ ed , traditional , sav@@ ings , eff@@ or@@ t@@ ful , com@@ passionate like op@@ ra@@ h ?
are they reli@@ able , stable , sav@@ vy , safe , na@@ vy , safe , bur@@ y , as@@ sau@@ ght and such as the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
in the course of the film , we had over 500 companies who were up and down corpo@@ ra@@ tions and the &quot; no , &quot; because they weren &apos;t going to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to be doing anything with this film , because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but it turns out that 17 marine part@@ ners who were willing to deal with these control that wanted to do with somebody doing business and deal with somebody so el@@ a@@ gu@@ ish as i , and who finally em@@ powered us to tell stories that we normally didn &apos;t have to tell -- stories that would never support a campaign .
it em@@ powered us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you today use mr@@ i today to listen to the pleasure centers of the brain to both be adverti@@ sing and to make movies as well
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o where foreign commercial was de@@ ple@@ ted .
in the entire city , five years since five years , no poster , no po@@ tter@@ er , no fl@@ yer , nothing .
and we went to school distri@@ cts , where businesses are moving their way into mis@@ pover@@ ished schools across the americ@@ ns all the countries .
the amazing thing for me is that the projects i had gotten the most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , these are the ones where i inter@@ ac@@ ted with things .
and that &apos;s what these ta@@ gs have done .
because they went to the medi@@ ting man , they ran the agen@@ cies , and they said that the agen@@ cies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate with the artists directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is going to challenge our world refle@@ cts .
and how did that have to succe@@ ed ? what succe@@ e@@ des ?
now , since the movie of s@@ um@@ ance &apos;s film had pre@@ mi@@ ered festi@@ val , we can see this .
according to bur@@ r@@ ari@@ an was the pre@@ mi@@ ere in janu@@ ary , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the entire thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls of this film .
that actually is only about two and a half weeks of time .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t given up yet .
it doesn &apos;t even have it online . it &apos;s not a fin@@ ti@@ ght .
it hasn &apos;t yet come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has got a very big inst@@ ant .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , in the almost every adverti@@ sing agen@@ cy that we talked to , to re@@ com@@ men@@ d their custom@@ ers to make money .
so one of the things that i think that is that if you measure your chance , risk is going to be in these risks .
i think if you keep people out of it , then you get them closer to failure .
i think if you &apos;re training your employees to avoid risk , you &apos;re prepar@@ ed to the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that when we reti@@ re people to move risks , we have to encoura@@ ge risk .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to have no fear of opportunity that they might be dist@@ ingu@@ ishing .
finally , we should wel@@ come the fear of wel@@ coming .
we should be put in the c@@ age in the c@@ age .
&quot; you &apos;re paying fear . &quot; &quot; you wel@@ come the risk . &quot;
there &apos;s a big spo@@ on full , that we &apos;re wel@@ come to risk .
and at last , we should be wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
no@@ wa@@ days , more than before , a little bit of honor makes us a little bit sa@@ i@@ d .
and that said , with hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my whole talk , &quot; you are wel@@ come transpar@@ ency , &quot; they were pres@@ ented by my good friends of em@@ c , who paid $ $ 7@@ 100 for the nam@@ i@@ di@@ ty to e@@ bay .
large data is trans@@ formed for organizations around the world to big opportunities .
em@@ c : &quot; you are wel@@ come transpar@@ ency . &quot;
thank you very much .
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency , this is : what &apos;s happened exactly with the $ 7@@ 100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my po@@ cket , repres@@ ented to the center of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing spring -- a check in al@@ titude of $ 7@@ 100 to fund my ted reach@@ es to the next year .
so my name is am@@ it .
so 18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i agre@@ ed to do something with muse@@ ums and art , my che@@ f@@ in , which is today , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months to do .
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , i can tell you , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
there are a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
so , i think my personal vision is very simple with this slide and her access .
now i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i don &apos;t inv@@ ent -- but i had too many muse@@ ums and these arti@@ facts do not allow me to access this art .
so as i travel@@ ed , and i vis@@ ited these muse@@ ums , i began a lot to learn .
and as i was working for google , i was trying to make this lon@@ ging -- art more inter@@ active -- with technology to lead together .
we then brought a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demon@@ stration , and i &apos;m going to tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to google &apos;s proto@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com .
you can look around in all these muse@@ ums here .
there &apos;s the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , the mom@@ a , the her@@ m@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , van go@@ gh .
i even get in one of my favorite , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
you get to two ways in two ways -- very simple .
by google , and bo@@ um , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you am@@ use .
you want to ori@@ ent in the museum ?
let &apos;s open the map , jump it with a click .
in there you &apos;re , you want to be up to the end of the final finish .
go on . lots of fun .
pu@@ ber@@ e you .
thank you , but the best is still happening .
so i am now a story of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , intri@@ t@@ ings of pie@@ te cock@@ ro@@ ils .
i see this collea@@ z@@ or sign .
if the museum has this picture , they click on it .
so this is one of the images .
so these are all the meta@@ data .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click this now .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been cap@@ tured with what we call the gi@@ g@@ app@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ -@@ technology .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion images of data , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion refle@@ ct points ? &quot;
this is what i &apos;m going to show you .
and you can easily zo@@ om in and zo@@ om out .
you &apos;re looking at something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
but then you really want to sit down .
and so i started to play around , and i realized that something was happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to close , and i noticed slowly that these kids were actually shu@@ ting up something .
i did a little bit , spoke with some familiar known , and actually found out that it was about a game called squ@@ a@@ il , which is about a piece of gan@@ a@@ il , which was pun@@ ched a piece of gan@@ de on the final floor .
seem@@ ingly it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned a little bit about it .
to really go close to it , you can go up to the ris@@ ky nar@@ row .
just to give you the over@@ look , let me zo@@ om out so you see what you get .
here we &apos;ve been , and this is the painting .
the best thing is still getting -- in a second .
let &apos;s just jump fast to mom@@ a , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , clim@@ b night .
now , in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the br@@ ush stri@@ kes ?
and what &apos;s only , if you want to see van go@@ gh this ma@@ ster@@ piece because create this g@@ ster@@ piece ?
you zo@@ om in . you can go into it .
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om into one of my favorite pan@@ el of this picture , until i &apos;m really in the zi@@ g .
this is stars &apos; night , probably seen this before .
now , i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot of other , but i don &apos;t have the time .
it &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions .
every single one of you , every -- if rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can sit and online to create your own museum -- of all these pictures of all these images , you can put your own colle@@ ction .
simple , you go in there -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s the power of zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om in .
this is the sh@@ and@@ paper , in the national ani@@ my .
you can see them all with evidence to send their friends , and so a conversation start about what they feel , when you look at these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
i think , conclu@@ sive to me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even get me out of the muse@@ ums .
i may not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience of me in hu@@ mili@@ ty for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be accu@@ rate with this digital medium of art , and show them online .
and so the biggest question that i &apos;m asked recently is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum class ? &quot;
and the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s meant to fill the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a map of your brain . your brain can be sub@@ divi@@ ded in two se@@ als .
this is the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then half the right , which is the intui@@ tive side .
if we had a degree to measure the ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ des of each he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , we could show your brain .
for example , this would be somebody who is completely logi@@ cal .
this would be somebody who is completely intui@@ tive .
now , where would you position your brain based on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extreme discipl@@ ines , but i think for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a big ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ st that is at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ sive , or so like that .
they can be a logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
and so i &apos;m seeing as one of the individuals , along with the most other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , to make a good form of lo@@ gic to com@@ bine the complex ideas .
but then , at the same time , we need a good number of jobs to actually try to emer@@ ge the experiments .
so how do we develop these intui@@ tions ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it , and then we look like it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
in fact , they do the same thing .
so one of the intui@@ tions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be only a place at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think about it , that a thing at the same time , but they &apos;re not born with this idea , but they were developed with this idea , they have developed it .
i remember a child watching a child on a floor table .
he was still a to@@ dd@@ ler and not very good at it , and he continu@@ ed to go on .
but i bet it taught him with the floor th@@ res@@ hold a very valuable lesson , which is that the big things don &apos;t just let you go through , and that they stay in one place .
and this is a great strate@@ cially proble@@ ral model in the world , so long as they &apos;re not a single physi@@ ci@@ sts .
it would be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist because it &apos;s not with soil table , it would be with these little aw@@ win@@ es particles .
and when you &apos;re playing with your particles , you &apos;re stuck all kinds of weird things -- like flying directly by walls , or that they can be at two different places .
and so they wrote all of these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called them the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
that was the state of physics a couple of years ago ; you needed quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it for the big everyday objects to describe around us .
that didn &apos;t res@@ on@@ ate my intuition , and that may just be because i &apos;m not so often playing with particles .
well , i do sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it .
i mean , no one &apos;s ever seen a partic@@ le .
but my logi@@ cal side didn &apos;t like it either .
because when all of the stuff are made of particles , and all these particles follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , shouldn &apos;t just be followed the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
i don &apos;t see any reason why this should not be that way .
so i would feel obviously better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show up that general objects are happening to the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so , i came up with a few years ago to do that .
i created a building .
this is the first object that you can see that was in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ strategy .
so , what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green do@@ t there in the center .
this is the piece metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
so this is a picture of the object .
here , it &apos;s something i put it up . we look at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really big clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s formed like a spr@@ out of a spr@@ up , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i did this thing in a similar way that you &apos;re doing a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new si@@ li@@ cide sh@@ ells , and i slowly te@@ sted for 32 hours on all the big hard@@ ware devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this as a swi@@ mming pool sha@@ ped hole and get the thing .
this thing has to be the ability in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position , but it needs a little bit of help to do it .
take a look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
you know how un@@ comfortable it is in a full el@@ ev@@ ator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m even in the el@@ ev@@ ator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i get other people to , and i hear to do all these things because i don &apos;t want to hurt them , or , frank@@ ly , they &apos;re fall@@ ing .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that in@@ sensitive objects are just the same .
the members of the mer@@ sen@@ able objects are not just people , but the lights that seem to be appe@@ aring to them and the wind that &apos;s e@@ aten on them and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this is a piece of metal mechan@@ um mechan@@ ically , we had to throw it out of all the way .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
we swi@@ t@@ ched the lights , put it in a vac@@ u@@ um , and clean all the air , and re@@ pair it almost to now , just in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the piece of metal was the piece of metal to be@@ have as much as it
so we measu@@ red his movement .
we found that it really was going to move out .
instead of that it &apos;s just cal@@ m there , it &apos;s vi@@ br@@ ated it , and the way it vi@@ br@@ ates is about as it &apos;s here -- like a radi@@ oc@@ ating and all the el@@ ev@@ ated bubble bal@@ coal .
we gave him a small push , we could vi@@ bra@@ te it at the same time , and not vi@@ br@@ ating -- something that could be allowed in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is , what really is amazing .
what does it mean for an object at the same time , not to vi@@ bra@@ te and not to vi@@ bra@@ te ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms that the piece metal is out of the piece of metal is sil@@ ently and at the same time , the same atoms move up and down and down
just too pre@@ cise time points , they agree .
the rest of the time , they are del@@ as@@ alized .
that means that every at@@ om at the same time is two different places , which means , at the same time , the entire piece of metal is two different places .
and i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , you check that , the scale difference between a single at@@ om and this piece metal is about just just the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single at@@ om can be in two different places , this piece of metal can be this piece of metal in two different places , so why not you ?
i mean , this is just what my logi@@ cal side says .
so , imagine if you were at the same time in multiple places , how would it feel ?
how would your consciousness occu@@ r that your body is pl@@ enting in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspe@@ ct in history .
so , as we war@@ med the lights and looked in the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always there in a piece .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks as if all the objects are in the out@@ put actually radi@@ ated objects that are comp@@ iled in a small space .
you hear a lot of talk about what transl@@ um mechan@@ ics say that everything is related to everything .
now , that &apos;s not quite accu@@ rate .
there &apos;s even more it , it &apos;s getting even more lower .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , are literally prote@@ cted who are literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and weird of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
thank you very much .
in 2007 , i decided that we should re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize the way we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about it , where they want to live and to work , they have the possibility to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition by new resi@@ dents .
at the moment , we are far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city that they would wel@@ come .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs them to build .
so we could just easily with the world with ridi@@ gu@@ ing , possibly even hundreds of new cities .
that sounds ab@@ sur@@ d for you now , because you &apos;ve never thought about new cities when you &apos;ve ever thought about new cities .
just swa@@ p out the building of a@@ part@@ ments against the cities .
but if you think about half of the people who want to live in a@@ part@@ ments , this is already , but the other half hasn &apos;t yet .
they could try to exp@@ and the capacity of exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
but you know what they would be there in the a@@ part@@ ments and their surro@@ und@@ ings , to regu@@ late the laws and con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts from re@@ duc@@ ing .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to get all of these exten@@ sions .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a whole new block block , as@@ sum@@ ing the laws there would support a building and not simply push it .
so i suggest@@ ed that governments create new direc@@ tors that give enough space for a city , and they gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
i later found out that , about the same time , ja@@ four and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o was thinking about the challenge of a re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year , about 7@@ 5,000 sa@@ dur@@ ism every year left your country to go out to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people in your country can stay and do the same thing in hon@@ dur@@ as .
at this point , j@@ four to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; what happens if we accept an in@@ hab@@ ited platform of our country -- what if we put it just a bit of a given -- a part of the american message , a part of the can@@ adi@@ an inter@@ fer@@ ment -- and when people want to work under the can@@ adi@@ an rule or the united states , can they work there , and can they go to the block of these mes@@ sages , what they typically would have to go to canada , or go to america ? &quot;
in summer 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as was under a major pri@@ ise of pri@@ ce .
in the next campaign , pe@@ stro@@ let lo@@ bo covered pe@@ ft in a tur@@ suit , whose program inclu@@ ded both new innova@@ tions and appe@@ ars .
he dem@@ and@@ ed oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his bro@@ ag@@ po@@ p .
in the mean@@ time , i pre@@ fer to take a talk at ted@@ global .
so , through impro@@ vement , and experim@@ entation , and through the analysis of consum@@ ers , i &apos;ve been trying to reduce this complicated concept of the french city to the general elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that deter@@ mine that you can &apos;t dist@@ ur@@ b exi@@ sting hous@@ ing fe@@ es .
we give new technology great attention , but for the progress needs it to be technologies and laws , and it &apos;s normally laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the ted@@ talk .
and the turn was shown him ja@@ vier .
the two kee@@ ps me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present this to the head of our country ! &quot;
so , in dec@@ ember , we met in the seat room of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make a clear of how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and i &apos;ve used this graph to show how valuable ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york . remember that a surface in some cases per square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstra@@ ct discussion , at a place when there was a pause , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , we could look at ted@@ talks . &quot;
so , the ted@@ talk publi@@ red in a very simple form that a char@@ ter city is a place whose initi@@ ated country , a fo@@ unding contra@@ ct that identi@@ fi@@ es the laws that ow@@ ner there and the people who are off@@ ering the possibility to decide either under these rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , who said that we have to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come after te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ .com and re@@ tain a talk on the fourth and fif@@ th of janu@@ ary .
so , i &apos;ve given another story with facts that have a graph like this inclu@@ ding a graph like this , trying to illu@@ strate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city of den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch is showing the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ ver .
in fact , this air@@ port has a hundred square kilometers .
so i &apos;ve been trying to convince the hon@@ dur@@ ist , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 square miles .
that &apos;s more than 25@@ ,000 ac@@ r@@ es .
poli@@ ni@@ ally , everybody &apos;s appl@@ au@@ ded .
vie@@ wers were very serious and attention to the audience .
the head of con@@ gress came on the stage , and they said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your talk , but could we look at the ted@@ talk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i put on me , and they played the ted@@ talk .
and i &apos;ve come to the core note that a new city off@@ ers people new opportunities .
there would be an opportunity to live in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as , rather than hundreds of miles down in the north .
and a new city also inclu@@ des new ways of leaders with leaders .
the leaders in hon@@ dur@@ as would be to help help from partner@@ ships that they could benefit from their partner countries , they could benefit from their partner countries who would support the laws for this char@@ ter and by the auth@@ ori@@ ties , that everyone can trust that the char@@ ter is really dis@@ advan@@ ced .
and president lo@@ bo , the discovery of president lo@@ bo , was that the spirit of transformation that i thought was a way of getting foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come and build this city in hon@@ dur@@ as for many years in hon@@ dur@@ as , who for many years was under fear and mi@@ str@@ ust .
we were travel@@ ing in an area .
this is a picture of this place .
it &apos;s a thousand square kilometers of wi@@ el@@ ds .
and just after that , in the 19@@ th of janu@@ ary , they vot@@ ed with con@@ gress for a change of the const@@ it@@ ution to have a negoti@@ ation that is essential for particular develop@@ mental environments .
in a country which has just been seen a strong crisis , in the con@@ gress for this agre@@ ement , with 1@@ 24 to a voice .
all the par@@ ties , all the organi@@ tions of society , suppor@@ ted this .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it needs to be appro@@ ved twice by the con@@ gress .
on febru@@ ary , in the 17@@ th of febru@@ ary , it was appro@@ ved to be a voice with 1@@ 14 .
in the immedi@@ ate after that ele@@ ction , between the 20th and the 24@@ th of febru@@ ary , a d@@ ele@@ gation ended about 30 b@@ ones of the world that were interested in the two places of the world that were interested in most of the business of the city .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big new urban town , which was built in south korea -- big than the city party of bri@@ st@@ ons .
everything you can see in this picture , was built within four years , after it took four years to recei@@ ve the per@@ mit@@ s .
the other place that was very interested in urban business is sing@@ apo@@ re .
it &apos;s been building two cities in china , and the third is in prepar@@ ation .
so , if you think of practical it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a site of space , and you &apos;re already going to mention this place for the second city .
it &apos;s already worked in a legal system that leaders have allowed access , and it &apos;s also worked in an ex@@ ternal law system .
a country already gave birth to its su@@ pre@@ me court , as a court for the de@@ gra@@ dation of the cor@@ respon@@ d@@ able thir@@ dance of the legal system .
urban designers and corpo@@ ra@@ cians are very interested .
they even bring fund@@ ing to people .
one thing , as you know now , has been diagno@@ sed , there are a lot of od@@ ans .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to de@@ constru@@ ct in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who &apos;d like to live there .
around the world there are 700 million people who ad@@ mit that they want to live to live in a different place .
a million people have lost la@@ tin america every year and migr@@ ated to the united states .
many of you are fa@@ thers who are forced to leave their families to sou@@ ze work to search -- sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to make enough money to afford food and clo@@ thing .
unfortunately , sometimes , there are children who are trying to find their parents that they , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen any more than a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about hon@@ dur@@ as in hon@@ dur@@ as to build a completely new city ?
or building even dist@@ ur@@ bing of these cities , or distribu@@ ted hundreds of electr@@ ons all over the world ?
so what is it for an idea to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition by new resi@@ dents ?
this is an idea that is worth spre@@ ading .
so my friends in hon@@ dur@@ as have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how much do you make a typical day on a typical day ?
you know , how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey with 2,000 american americans , and the average number of decisions , which my@@ matically makes a typical american in a day is 70 .
addi@@ tion@@ ically , recently , a study was done with ce@@ os , where they looked for a gr@@ os for a week .
and these scientists just docum@@ ented the different subje@@ cts that these ce@@ o are consum@@ ing , and how much time they have gotten to make decisions that rel@@ ate to the the@@ mes .
and what they found is that an average ce@@ o is bus@@ y with 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks in the week .
each of these the@@ mes , of course , made for lots and lots of little decisions .
fif@@ ty percent of their decisions were met within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their choices requi@@ red to them an hour or more .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of categ@@ ory to those in an hour of categ@@ ory ?
how well , do you think they are able to cop@@ e with decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the greatest decisi@@ on-@@ making of our modern times , the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem .
i want to talk about the problem , and a few possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you a couple of questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i put you a question , you raise , because i &apos;m blind , just one hand , if you want to burn some cal@@ ories .
otherwise , let me ask you , when i &apos;m asking you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question is : are you ready to hear about the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem ?
thank you very much .
when i was a graduate student at stanford , i went to this very ex@@ ecu@@ tive food center , but at least he was ex@@ clu@@ sive .
it was a store called the ki@@ i@@ ser &apos;s name .
this business , it was almost like a bl@@ ess@@ ing park .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d and obs@@ essi@@ g and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ it and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually dr@@ one up to fix@@ ing water .
i loved being to go to this store , but at one point , i wonder@@ ed , well , how does it come from buying something ?
here &apos;s the o@@ live oil cour@@ ker .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were once in bo@@ xes that came from a thousand years old o@@ vi@@ b@@ ands .
so one day i decided to go to the army one day , and i asked the la@@ d@@ der , &quot; does this model work that they really provide to the people of all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed on the bus@@ es of tou@@ ri@@ sts who came everyday and they usually had their c@@ ameras in there .
we decided to give an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ alle@@ d@@ ship for our experiment .
here &apos;s your sig@@ nature tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of mar@@ sa@@ d@@ sen@@ les .
we put a little car@@ di@@ ast table right at the stage of the business .
we put six different fla@@ vor@@ s of ta@@ beg@@ s there or 24@@ -@@ different taste lo@@ cks , and we looked at two things : one , i think , i guess what more people are going to stand and do go@@ d@@ der would try to do ?
they &apos;re more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent when they were six , about 40 percent .
and after@@ wards , we saw ourselves that people were actually buying a glass of mar@@ ting a glass of mar@@ ting
now we looked at the rever@@ se effect .
of the people who were left when they were 24 , only three percent were bought a glass of mar@@ thou@@ se .
of the people who were left when we were six , well , we saw that 30 percent of them bought a glass of mar@@ ty@@ el .
well , if you calcul@@ ated it , people bought six times more a glass of mar@@ sa@@ l , which you had six to choice than if you had 24 choices .
now , to send not a glass tag is probably good for us -- but anyway , it &apos;s good for our appar@@ ence -- but it turns out the decisi@@ on-@@ making design effect caused us to influence very con@@ sequence in very concent@@ r@@ ation decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even if it &apos;s going against our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day : financial sav@@ ings .
so i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i did with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , t@@ ich kam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i j@@ ang , where we looked at the decisions for most million americans from about 6@@ 50 coun@@ ties in the entire united states of about 6@@ 50 meters in the entire united states .
and what we saw was whether the number of f@@ on@@ d@@ ur services that were possible to make a reti@@ re@@ ment activity , the 40@@ 1 plan , caused the prob@@ ability of whether more tomorrow is saving for tomorrow .
and we found that , in fact , there was a context .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 tri@@ ps that off@@ ered people somewhere between two to 5@@ 9 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were off@@ ered that , indeed , partici@@ ent@@ ating was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme extreme , the plans that two fund off@@ ers , a partic@@ le in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- still not as big as we want .
in the plans that would acc@@ ele@@ te nearly 60 fund , the sig@@ ning tar@@ gets quickly fall to about the six@@ th-@@ century percentage .
now it turns out that even if you were to agree with more op@@ tions , if more choices were to choose , even it has negative consequences .
so people who were adop@@ ting to participa@@ te , rather , that the more important they were at risk , the more avo@@ i@@ des they were avo@@ ying it , the more avo@@ i@@ ded them .
the more opportunities they were available to each other , the more they put their entire money into p@@ ure money services .
none of these extreme decisions is ow@@ ned to the decisions that someone would re@@ com@@ men@@ d if we &apos;re important to their future well-@@ being .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that bring this to provide more and more choices from more and more choices .
they pre@@ fer the decision -- push them on , even if it &apos;s going against their own best interest .
they make much worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical choices .
they &apos;re more willing to decide for things that they &apos;re less happy for , even if they make it obje@@ ctive better .
so , the main reason for this is that we might enjoy this huge shel@@ ves full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mu@@ star@@ d , achie@@ vement and mar@@ ade , but we can &apos;t draw the compar@@ ison and di@@ stra@@ ctions , and then actually sele@@ ct something out of the fantastic charge .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we test in various types of research and in different research places -- that they can just use in your business .
first , don &apos;t stop .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today that less is .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; limit@@ s . &quot;
they always worry they &apos;re losing the surface of the earth .
but , in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to stop limit@@ s , and the un@@ important consi@@ gation is getting rid , well , there &apos;s an increase of sal@@ es , it &apos;s aug@@ mented the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an impro@@ vement of decisi@@ on-@@ making perception .
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble re@@ duced the different head and 2 species of the number of us to 15 , they changed an increase of sal@@ es by 10 percent .
when the gold c@@ at corpo@@ ration got rid of her 10 to the worst selling geogra@@ at sta@@ us , they found that the pay@@ s at 8@@ 7 percent -- a value of others , the rise of sal@@ es and re@@ duced costs .
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ kr@@ t today , off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
a typical wal@@ m@@ art off@@ ers you to 10@@ 0,000 products today .
but the most ne@@ un@@ ti@@ zed super@@ market , which is now north largest super@@ market in the world today , and they offer them 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in a do@@ se .
now in the world of motiv@@ ators , i think one of the best examples that came out recently , about how you best write the choice of choice , was something that david la@@ gar@@ son has very strong contribu@@ ted , it &apos;s a program that is off@@ ered at harvard .
every single harvard prof@@ its auto@@ matically takes auto@@ matically at a sur@@ al fund .
those who are want to make a choice , are 20 fund off@@ ers , not 300 or more f@@ ans .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i should limited it .
they &apos;re all important op@@ tions . &quot;
and the first thing i asked the asking is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities diff@@ er from one another .
and if they can &apos;t keep them apart , their custom@@ ers don &apos;t have their custom@@ ers . &quot;
now , before we started this morning , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
and g@@ ary said that he was ready to offer all the people in this audience who would offer a real coun@@ sel@@ ing vac@@ ation on the most beautiful streets in the world .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read you to read .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read , and then i &apos;m going to ask you to cla@@ p along , if you &apos;re willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s service .
okay . anybody who willing to adop@@ t g@@ ary &apos;s off@@ ices .
is that all anyone ?
all right , let me show you a little bit more of this .
they knew it was a trick , couldn &apos;t they ?
now , who &apos;s ready to do this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that you look at obje@@ c@@ tively during the first time , during the first time , but i would like to tell it to stop the first time , but i would re@@ count it for the second time .
because the images were suppor@@ ting it for them .
what brings me to the second technology that help you to deal with the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making , it &apos;s the con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between opportunities , to understand the difference between the individual possibilities of the individual possibilities , and that that has to be felt of that con@@ sequence of vi@@ ble and con@@ cre@@ te .
why are people a@@ il@@ ing at an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use a commercial card or a credit card than they do in a bar@@ gain ?
because it &apos;s not us we feel good money .
and it turns out that when you build it that something feels con@@ cre@@ te , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you get people to save more .
so we started in a study that i did with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o fli@@ ter@@ o , we did a study with the people in ring -- employees who have all worked for struggle -- and these people were all in a gather@@ ing in which they sig@@ ned their participa@@ tion for their reti@@ re@@ ment services
and in this gather@@ ing , we &apos;ve with@@ held this conven@@ tion as it was always , only evolved , we ad@@ ded a small quality .
the small thing that we decided to make was that we asked people to think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
which we did this simple thing , there was an increase of participa@@ tion by 20 percent , and there was an increase within the number of people who were willing to save or raise an increase by four percent by the re@@ venue that they were ready to pay for the sav@@ ings of care .
the third technology : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
we can make better with more categ@@ ories than with more choices than with more choices .
here &apos;s , for example , a study we did in a ti@@ me@@ -@@ time course .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the loo@@ p of super@@ markets up and down in the nor@@ the@@ ast area , and the number of 3@@ 3@@ 1 different types of maga@@ zin@@ es has vari@@ ed up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 new@@ l@@ ar .
but , you know what ?
if i show you 600 seas@@ zin@@ es , and i put them into 10 categ@@ ers , or i divi@@ ded them in 10 categ@@ ers , and then i think i shared them in a million categ@@ ories , then they think i had more choice and a better choice than i had to give you the 400 comm@@ and@@ ments to this , if i had given you the 600 .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how i can hold them apart .
so here are two different g@@ our@@ ges .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz , &quot; and the other is called s@@ wing .
if you think that the left will is the left angle , and the display on ja@@ zz is , they cla@@ p into the hands .
okay , so there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the one on the left is ja@@ zz , and the one on the right is on the right side , you &apos;re appl@@ au@@ ding you .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz , and the right on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
this is a highly un@@ reas@@ able categ@@ ori@@ zation sche@@ me
the categ@@ ories need to say something not to the consum@@ er , not to off@@ ers choice .
and this problem is often what you see when you look at the long li@@ sts of all these f@@ on@@ ds .
who do you want to in@@ form with this ?
my fourth technology is pre@@ vent@@ able for complexity .
it turns out that we can address more information than we think we can deal with just simpli@@ fy them .
we have to exp@@ and the complexity .
let me show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the pur@@ ch@@ ase of a car .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er who provi@@ des them the possibility to con@@ figure her car .
you have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to create your car completely .
now these decisions in the number of choices that you provide per decision are going to provide per choice .
car colors , outside of the automo@@ bil@@ es -- i have 5@@ 6 op@@ tions .
mot@@ ors , ge@@ ar -- four op@@ tions .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i &apos;m making the sequence in which the decisions are .
half the cli@@ ents are going to be from the many possibilities , 5@@ 6 car colors to the low possibilities , four cu@@ l@@ ings .
the other half of the custom@@ er is going from the low possibilities , four ge@@ ar , to the 5@@ 6 car colors , many possibilities .
what do you look at me ?
how good they are .
if she &apos;s going to use the standard choice in the decision , that means that they &apos;re being over@@ la@@ sted , the hot@@ est , i lose them .
what you find is that the people who keep from many to the low choices are always vot@@ ing and again the standard ele@@ ction .
we are losing them .
go from the low choice to the many , stay in the quanti@@ ty . then
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of op@@ tions .
the only thing i did is to change the sequence that this information is played .
when i start with the simple beginning , i study how i choose .
even though the ge@@ ese sele@@ cts , i don &apos;t say anything about my supp@@ lege with the inter@@ ior mind , it &apos;s still prepar@@ ing me to pick me up .
it also puts me into exciting terms about the big product that i collapse , and so i &apos;m ready to motiv@@ ate myself with some interest .
let me wra@@ p it up .
i &apos;ve talked to you about four techniques that are the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making mil@@ ls -- con@@ cre@@ te -- are they going to be the reli@@ able alterna@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zing -- do it real ; categ@@ ori@@ zing , we can better deal with more categ@@ ories , less possibilities ; to dep@@ t .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are thought to help them manage the opportunities -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for the people that they offer service .
because i think that the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re pi@@ cky at choice .
and the more we are sel@@ ec@@ tive in choo@@ sing , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in allowed , i &apos;m kev@@ in mer@@ c@@ ca , laun@@ ch mana@@ gers at youtube . i sometimes look at youtube video .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how microsoft is vi@@ ral , and followed , why is it important for even .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed so inten@@ se as infin@@ itely difficult .
but web video has allo@@ w@@ ned that we can all be artic@@ ul@@ ated by all of our creative activi@@ ties in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous on the internet to the next satur@@ day .
but at youtube , over 4@@ 8 hours of video per minute is u@@ plo@@ aded .
again , only a tiny percentage is ever vi@@ ral a tiny percentage , and is vie@@ wed thousands of times and so on for cultural times .
so , how does this work ?
three things : ta@@ st@@ ers , partic@@ le workers and the un@@ expected ones .
well , let &apos;s take a look .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god !
who@@ a !
o@@ h@@ -@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
last year , the phot@@ vas@@ ber z sen@@ ded this video that he shot in front of his house in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
this ch@@ art shows what it looks like when the video was popular last summer .
in fact , henry didn &apos;t want to make a vi@@ ral video .
he just wanted to share a rain@@ hu@@ bo@@ w .
because you &apos;re doing it way when you &apos;re called yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain of space .
he had u@@ plo@@ aded a lot of natural video .
and this video was actually being sent in janu@@ ary .
what &apos;s going on here ?
there was j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel then plan@@ ted the t@@ we@@ et , who was so popular at the inst@@ ant .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ glo@@ es make us new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . god . god get down@@ day to the studio day , scot@@ k@@ le . everybody &apos;s foot@@ i@@ to , scot@@ k@@ le . fri@@ day , fri@@ day . you weren &apos;t thinking that we were going to lead these entertain@@ ment to talk to this video without talking about this video , i hope .
re@@ bec@@ ca ji@@ ac@@ k &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times this year .
so this is what the graphi@@ cs looked like .
just like &quot; axis rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; seems to be made out of no@@ where .
what &apos;s happened that day ?
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know it , these other spi@@ kes are also fri@@ days .
but what about that day , this particular fri@@ day , this particular fri@@ day ?
now to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 gab@@ it , a lot of blogs started to write about it .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from the myster@@ y science theater was the first person to do with twitter about a funny .
now what matters is that a single person or group of ta@@ ste@@ tors took a focus point , and they shared a big audience , so that they could acceler@@ ate the process .
then this community of people formed that big insi@@ der and started talking about it and started to talk about it and to monit@@ or with it .
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; fri@@ ck day &quot; at youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single day of a week .
unlike the en@@ equal entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , the participa@@ tion of the community is our way to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spread it or doing something new .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; anima@@ tion and music in end@@ -@@ down loo@@ p .
it &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
this year , it was looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you keep it for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three hours of this version that was looked at four million times .
and even cat@@ s look at this video .
cat@@ s look at cat@@ s , who look at this video .
what matters is , the creativity that has been in the internet culture of tech and ge@@ e@@ ks .
there was re@@ mix@@ e .
somebody made an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of this .
and then it became international .
a whole re@@ mix community shot from the ground that made it from a du@@ m@@ b jo@@ ke to something we can all agree at .
today , we don &apos;t just find pleasure of something , we do with it .
who could have thought that would all be true ?
who could predict &quot; please rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca po@@ at , or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at ? &quot;
what were they going to write to their writing in which this is supposed to be ?
in a world where each minute is u@@ plo@@ aded two days of video , only very unique and un@@ expected foot@@ print , like the videos oc@@ br@@ ated .
i ad@@ mit@@ t , i wasn &apos;t a particularly interested , when a friend told me , i &apos;ll look at this great video , about a guy who was prote@@ sting in new york against a c@@ up of ti@@ tis@@ s .
i got a ti@@ mel@@ ine , because i didn &apos;t go on the bi@@ ke , but often there are dis@@ ab@@ led there , but often there are dis@@ abilities that are not going to take you on the bi@@ ke path .
because this was quite surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey swe@@ wer@@ y was a strange idea , and his point was looking at five million times .
this approach is true for all new things that we &apos;re creative doing .
and this brings us to one of the big questions ...
what does that mean ?
ah@@ -@@ h@@ h .
what does that mean ?
ta@@ sting manufac@@ stic , creative explor@@ er communities , are un@@ expected , are the characteri@@ stics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to , and in which the audi@@ ences defined popular .
as i said , one of the currently largest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- did his start at youtube .
nobody has to give out feel@@ es of green light .
and today , we feel all of us as ow@@ ners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteri@@ stics of the old media , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely to the media of today , but they &apos;re going to deter@@ mine the conversation of the future .
thank you very much .
i can talk for 10 minutes about the inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness between women talk about three generations , and how the ast@@ on@@ ishing strength of this lin@@ k-@@ year-old cont@@ acts in the lives of a four@@ -year-old girl was mani@@ fest in the life of a four@@ -year-old boat , when she was combin@@ ed over 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , a inter@@ connec@@ te@@ ness that kept stuck in the lives of this little girl and never disappe@@ ared -- this little girl , now in san francisco and spea@@ ks today -- this little girl that lives in san francisco and spea@@ ks to you today ?
there &apos;s not a story the story .
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that is still put together .
so i want to tell you about some of the puzz@@ le .
imagine the first piece : a man who burning his life &apos;s work .
he &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a man whose whole life was held by the simple hope of both of his own hom@@ tly and freedom .
now if you look at it in sa@@ ig@@ on &apos;s inv@@ ent@@ or in sa@@ ig@@ on , he must ad@@ mit that his life was a very a wa@@ ste@@ hood .
the words , as long as his friends , now the ligh@@ t@@ ning .
he moved back into sil@@ ence .
he was dying , broke by the story .
and he &apos;s my grand@@ father .
i &apos;ve never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
my grandmother never has for@@ gotten his life to me .
i had to make sure it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story tried to cr@@ ush us , but we ran it through .
the next piece is how a boat is running up in the early mor@@ di@@ an sun@@ sil@@ ver on la@@ kes .
my mother , may , was 18 when her father died -- in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , with two little girls .
for her , she had been challen@@ ged to her a task : the flight of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely dist@@ ur@@ bed that they could fail to fail .
after a four@@ -year-old and film sa@@ va cor@@ respon@@ ded a boat on the sea , as a fishing see@@ d@@ boat .
all adults were horri@@ ble to the risks .
the biggest fear they had before pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wor@@ e a little tox@@ ic bottle .
in a pris@@ on@@ er , my sister and me had only my sister and me , and then you dr@@ one of it .
my first memor@@ ies are from this boat -- the ste@@ ad@@ y tu@@ ck@@ ers of the engine , the vel@@ ing of one wave on the bu@@ g , the vast and empty hori@@ zon .
i don &apos;t remember the pi@@ st@@ ings that came a lot of times , but they thre@@ w away from the death gra@@ y of the men on our boat , or the bottom of the engine that didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform outside of the mal@@ ay@@ an coast , and to the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and to the taste of the first apple , which one of the men was on the platform .
no apple ever pus@@ hed this way again .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece is from four women in three generations , which together build a new life .
we were leaving in foot@@ sc@@ ray , one from work@@ school class in the sub@@ ur@@ bs that are foreig@@ ned by im@@ migr@@ ant la@@ yers .
unlike in the ol@@ d-@@ class national sub@@ ur@@ bs that existence to me was completely un@@ known , there were no sophisti@@ cated thought in ph sc@@ ray .
the cab@@ ks coming out of the land@@ lines from the rest of the world .
and the pe@@ ach@@ ed english stories were broad@@ cast between people who had one thing in common : they started rein@@ ven@@ ting .
my mother was working on far@@ ms , then on a car factory , six days , two days , dou@@ ble@@ -@@ 3@@ ligh@@ ts .
they had somehow come to find the time to ac@@ qui@@ re english and it@@ ary quali@@ fi@@ cations .
we &apos;ve been poor .
each dollar was cut , and was con@@ sol@@ ed into higher education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for it . usually , the new stuff , which always came from the second hand .
two pair of str@@ ings for school , each to cover the holes in the other .
a school uni@@ form to the big sti@@ ck@@ les because she had to do six years .
and there were the rare but pain@@ ful gi@@ ants of &quot; the bad eye , &quot; and here and here and here , &quot; asi@@ ts , goes home . &quot;
after now , where ?
a little dist@@ ur@@ bed in me .
there was a meeting to re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation , and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go to you out of the way . &quot;
my mom , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every ev@@ ening , but we told each other of our day , and listen@@ ed to the mov@@ ements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suff@@ ered about the les@@ i@@ ons from the boat .
and it was my job to stay every night , until her alp@@ est dreams came , so i could insu@@ late it .
she opened a computer business , then did a co@@ s@@ me@@ tic training , and then still launched a business .
and the women came through their stories of men who didn &apos;t feed change , an@@ gry and im@@ pati@@ ent children , united of pe@@ cu@@ ls caught between two worl@@ ds .
out@@ lo@@ ads and spon@@ sor@@ s have been se@@ arch@@ ed .
central centers were built .
i lived in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
in one , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ a@@ tic student who helped incredibly per@@ si@@ ve conver@@ sa@@ tions in himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in ir@@ safe life , wearing the tra@@ gic ed@@ n of violence , drug ab@@ lation and insu@@ lation .
but that was how many years there had been help .
and because of these sorts of help , i was sel@@ ec@@ ted in my last year of law austr@@ ali@@ cians of the year .
and i was ul@@ tter@@ ed by a piece of puzz@@ le to the next , and the ra@@ thers were not com@@ part@@ ment@@ ally .
tan le , anony@@ m@@ ant cre@@ ators of foot@@ sc@@ ray , now tan b@@ ass , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activi@@ sts , who had been invited to talk to places that they never heard and in res@@ identi@@ al , which they never could have imag@@ ined .
i didn &apos;t trust the lab@@ els with the lab@@ els .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the out@@ t .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know about anything to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into the r@@ out@@ ine and the em@@ ble@@ dness of an un@@ known pres@@ identi@@ al of an un@@ known pres@@ identi@@ al -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters who dist@@ ingu@@ ished every single day as 20 years , by telling each other the stories of their day and st@@ um@@ met , we still got three in the bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she remin@@ ded me that i now was as old as she was at the time that we clim@@ bed the boat .
no , never had been a way .
&quot; do it simple , &quot; she said . &quot; and don &apos;t you don &apos;t do what you &apos;re . &quot;
so i talked about ju@@ gen@@ dar@@ y and education , and mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized of mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the life@@ ways , so many of them were doing what they loved on the bor@@ ders of the possible .
and even though i gradu@@ ated from my , i realized that i could not find myself with a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
there had to be another piece of the puzz@@ le .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new bon@@ te@@ ur , new in the image -- and not just okay , but not just okay , but something which you have to gr@@ ist , maybe a gift of the bo@@ ots .
because to speak as ligh@@ tly the hori@@ zon can lead to the l@@ ength of the horizon@@ tory , so light can mean you &apos;re accep@@ ted the environment .
i &apos;m now getting enough from my conven@@ tional zone to know that , yes , the world is breaking out , but not the way you &apos;re concerned .
possibilities that would not be allowed were ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it .
there was a energy , an in@@ san@@ able optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of the hu@@ mili@@ ty and the pi@@ ck@@ le .
so i looked at my gut feeling .
i gather@@ ed a little team of people around me for whom the comp@@ elling &quot; not &quot; was a stra@@ ig@@ h@@ u@@ ous challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a co@@ p .
at the end of a day , i &apos;ve been cooking a huge ma@@ d@@ th sou@@ p that we shared .
we worked late late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we were able to do the break@@ through .
i met the decision to move to the united states .
after just a journey there .
my gut feeling repe@@ at .
three months later , i was moved , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure continu@@ es .
now , before i leave that talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in in the most important person .
life did not change for cent@@ u@@ ries for cent@@ u@@ ries .
her father died shor@@ tly after her birth .
her mother just well@@ ed her up .
when she was 17 , she was the second woman of a psychop@@ in whose mother suggest@@ ed her .
without assi@@ stance of her husband , she convinced her for a stand@@ hole by brought him in trial and in her own case , and a much bigger sen@@ sation when she won .
&quot; don &apos;t go , &quot; it was un@@ anim@@ ous .
i &apos;ve just du@@ ried in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney , when she died , 1,000 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and i looked through the nar@@ row wall , and i looked at it on the other side .
i knew that she had come to sleep to be wrong .
my mother was calling me for a few minutes after@@ wards .
a few days later , we went into a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in broad@@ sc@@ ray , and we sat around their sar@@ g .
we told her stories , and as@@ sur@@ ed her that we were with her .
about mid@@ night , the mon@@ k and said , he had to close the sar@@ let .
my mother asked us to shu@@ t her hand .
and she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm , and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she kept it ton@@ ight , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let you go . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , then it &apos;s moving through the women .
you see who we were , and how life sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men who probably got into our lives had gotten into the street .
the de@@ fe@@ ct would have been too simple .
now i would like to have my own kids , and i think i &apos;m going to think about the boat .
who would ever ever want to have a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m sc@@ ared of privi@@ lege , in hei@@ ght , for p@@ ure pro@@ cla@@ ma@@ tion .
can i give you a bo@@ g in your life , the coura@@ ge@@ ous pull of every wave , the un@@ adul@@ ted tu@@ cks of the mot@@ ors , the large hori@@ zon that doesn &apos;t guar@@ an@@ tee ?
well i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that , and i certainly could go through it , i would .
now , t@@ ans &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fif@@ th row today .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y with you .
is it ever photograph@@ y ?
because that &apos;s , of course , a picture that you can &apos;t absor@@ b with your camera .
but , my interest in photograph@@ y started when i received my first digital camera , at the age of 15 years .
i combin@@ ed it with my previous pre@@ c@@ ision for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because using the camera using the process more in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process is the process when you press on the cover .
so for me , photograph@@ y seemed to be more about to be in the right place at the right place .
i believed anyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something that would start the process when the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es is being pres@@ sed .
photographs like this : a lot of construction along a lot of empty road .
but it has an un@@ expected agi@@ li@@ um .
and yet another reali@@ stic level is a reali@@ stic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and color@@ ful simul@@ tane@@ ously , but all with the common goal to keep a reali@@ stic level .
i mean , when i say reality , i think of phot@@ o-@@ reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really get in , but i also want to leave it as if you had it , like you could have had a photograph .
photographs that you have to think a little bit about to find the trick .
so it &apos;s much more designed to capture an idea than really a moment .
what does the trick that makes it reali@@ stic look at ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what does the illusion creates ?
sometimes it &apos;s the perspective of the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpre@@ t the world , and how we can make the world interpre@@ table on a two-@@ dimensional structure .
it &apos;s not about what reali@@ stic is , but what we think is reali@@ stic .
so , i think the basic laws are very simple .
i see it as a puzz@@ le of reality , where you can take several pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example of this .
we have three ultra@@ -@@ symme@@ able objects that we can all identify with in a three-@@ dimensional world .
but combin@@ ed in a particular way , you can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , as if it could exist .
but then , at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med our brains , because our brain just doesn &apos;t really accept that it does not really make sense .
and i use the same process in combin@@ ation of photos .
it &apos;s really just about trying to com@@ bine different reali@@ ties .
so the things that make an image reali@@ stic come to reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our daily life .
but if we combin@@ ing photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you look mis@@ er@@ able .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to reach out to be a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
as you can see , these are not three special pain@@ t@@ ings .
but just combin@@ ed something special like this is creating something like this .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ing photographs should have the same thing .
secon@@ dly , we want combin@@ ed photos to have the same ligh@@ ting capacity .
and these two pictures meet these two eff@@ or@@ ts -- from the same al@@ titude and the same ligh@@ ting way .
and third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to make it possible where the individual images are beginning and close by conne@@ cting them se@@ am@@ less@@ less@@ ly .
it makes impossible to say how the picture was actually put together .
so by looking at paint , con@@ cre@@ te and characteri@@ stics on the sta@@ tions to gli@@ de the individual pictures , fill photogra@@ phic barri@@ ers , like the field dep@@ th , un@@ looked colors and dis@@ ruption , we sleep the boundar@@ ies between the different images and let it look like a single photo , despite a picture basically in hundreds of levels of levels .
now , here &apos;s another example .
you may think that this is just a landscape shot , and the lower part was mani@@ pul@@ ated .
but this image is actually completely com@@ posed of pictures of photographs of different places .
i personally fin@@ der that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go a com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
but it invol@@ ves a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to inspi@@ re them , to find the different places for the pieces of the j@@ ig@@ les .
for example , the fish had been absor@@ bed on a des@@ k@@ top trip .
the winter is from a different place .
the under@@ water sli@@ ce comes out of a quar@@ ch .
and yeah , i even f@@ ought the house up on the island , to make it look swe@@ dis@@ h .
so to get to a reali@@ stic out@@ come , it &apos;s been ha@@ ining from me on planning .
i always start with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
that &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of these various images .
and here , every piece of your piece is very good .
and when you make good t@@ ust , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite reali@@ stic .
so it &apos;s all tools , and the only thing that is resi@@ stant to us is our imagination .
thank you very much .
i would like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects fail .
and i think that the most important thing about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced at the auth@@ or of the auth@@ or university was to make a major audience .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific -- it shows a c@@ up of coffee or te@@ a , and ask the patient , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how do you do ?
how can we help with you ? &quot;
and we think , we want to think that this is one of the main problems why everybody -- maybe most of the electr@@ onic health projects failed : because we stopped listening .
this is my ta@@ pe@@ stry sche@@ me . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a butt@@ on , it &apos;s got a butt@@ on .
and every morning i jump for it .
and yeah , i have a job , as you may recognize .
i got my job at 95 k@@ g .
it simply works very simple : every time i jum@@ p up the ward , she &apos;ll send my data on google health .
and there , they &apos;re also called my general physi@@ cians , so that he can recognize where my fair problems are , not just the moment where i need car@@ di@@ ological support or something , but also to a look at the past .
now , there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4@@ ,000 fol@@ ds to twitter .
so every morning i jum@@ p up on my ta@@ hn &apos;s rise , and people talk to me before i go in the car , &quot; to lunch just before i sit in the car , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
but this is the ni@@ test thing about what can happen , because this is the rou@@ ta@@ ge , grou@@ er to help patients , because that could be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , or it could be used by patients smo@@ king .
but it could also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs and to get them to play any kind of play to control their health .
at the next week , it &apos;s coming at the market .
it &apos;s going to be giving this little blood pressure dete@@ ction that you &apos;re holding to an iphone or something .
and it &apos;s going to en@@ able people to measure their blood pressure , send it on their doctor and share it for other people , for a little over 100 dollars .
at that point , the patients come in . they cannot take control of control , cap@@ tain on their own ship , but also in health care , the challenges that are facing us , and the cost explosion of health care , which are ahead of us , and the cost explosion of health care , econom@@ ed dem@@ ands , and so on .
do metho@@ ds that are easy to use , and begin with this , to mi@@ g patients in the team .
and they can do that by doing these sorts of metho@@ ds , but also by crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i &apos;d like to share with you a quick video .
we have all kinds of navi@@ gation systems in our cars .
in fact , even in our cell phones .
we know pre@@ cis@@ ely where all of the at@@ ms are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ zing .
we know more one where all the cen@@ su@@ s are .
and sure , we can find fast food bul@@ bs .
but where would the next a@@ ed be to help for this patient ?
we were asking around , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the ne@@ ar@@ est life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed was hit@@ ted at that moment .
so what did we do ? we per@@ formed crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we took a website and asked a crowd of people , &quot; if you see an a@@ ged , please tell us where it &apos;s , when he &apos;s up , &quot; because he &apos;s closed , &quot; because he &apos;s closed during business times , of course
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds have been repor@@ ted in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
so the next step was to find the app@@ s for it .
and we have an i@@ pad called an i@@ pad .
we developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , exp@@ and@@ ed reality to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht and someone &apos;s clim@@ bing up , you can use your iphone , and in the next weeks , your micro@@ software cell phone , to find the next a@@ ar that can save lives .
and by today , we don &apos;t want to be just as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , as the product is called , but as a@@ g@@ 4@@ us is taking place .
and we want to bring this up on a worldwide level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universi@@ ties , about helping us be@@ have like clu@@ es to crow@@ d@@ source these a@@ e@@ ds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and someone &apos;s collap@@ sing , whether it &apos;s your own relative or anyone else , you can find such an a@@ ed like this .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us in con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion of these a@@ e@@ ds .
these might be a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ kee@@ pers , or techni@@ cians , for example , to make sure that the sig@@ ned a@@ ed is still in this place .
please join us in this , and try to take health not just something , but take control of it .
thank you very much .
today , i &apos;m going to report about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
i &apos;m working in the solar technology industry .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p , that we want us to force ourselves to the conser@@ vation by ...
... it &apos;s ad@@ ded to crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
so here &apos;s a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh . it &apos;s a minute .
it might have to until it &apos;s pur@@ por@@ ted .
now , we can just jump across that -- i &apos;ll just jump through the video instead .
no@@ pe .
that &apos;s not ...
all right .
sol@@ sol@@ y-@@ technology is ...
oh , my time is far over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a few years ago , i launched a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in a neighborhood that is pretty much everything that they hate so much , what they really hat@@ ed them , we did it in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace cor@@ ps for the computer ge@@ e@@ ks .
we choose some field lo@@ ws each year , and we let them work with dom@@ esti@@ c management activi@@ ties .
instead of sending it to the third world , we send it to the third world in paris .
and there they were great app@@ s , working with dom@@ esti@@ c employees .
but what you really do is is to show what can be done with technology .
so get on al .
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s se@@ arch@@ ing for a date , but what he really sear@@ ches him is someone who broke him down when he &apos;s on twi@@ sting , because he knows , he &apos;s not very good at brand@@ ing when he &apos;s sus@@ pen@@ ded by a meter of s@@ now .
how did he get to se@@ ek in this particular way to help ?
we had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in boston last year , the code for america for america .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it did tend to have a lot of time last febru@@ ary .
and they found that the city never sna@@ ps these hy@@ dr@@ ents fre@@ ak@@ ed .
but a particular fellow , a man named er@@ ik &apos;s hol@@ ter fe@@ ver , saw another thing , and that was that the resi@@ dents were breaking the si@@ de@@ walk , right in front of these sequence .
so he did what every good develop@@ er would do , he wri@@ tes an ap@@ p .
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p , where you can adop@@ t a fire fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
you know that you &apos;re going to pick up to it when it &apos;s fast .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and then he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away to you .
so , there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a very hum@@ ble little ap@@ p .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s who wrote the ro@@ cks in the last year .
but it does something that no other government technology is doing .
it spre@@ ads rapi@@ dly .
there &apos;s this guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . con@@ fron@@ tion of the city hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who has seen that he could use this ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but to adop@@ t the citizens of tsun@@ am@@ i@@ a si@@ r@@ ens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ am@@ ics work work , but people are ste@@ aling the bat@@ ter@@ ies .
this is how he got the citizens to check them .
and then se@@ attle decided to use the ap@@ p to get the citizens to clean the bri@@ ff@@ et@@ ed gul@@ l@@ ys .
and chicago has just launched it so that people get the rus@@ h low off , when it &apos;s scrat@@ ching .
we now know about nine cities that plan to use this ap@@ p .
and it &apos;s pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ally distribu@@ ted , organic , of course .
if you know about government technology , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually go like this .
a few years of software dri@@ ves a few years .
we had a team that worked last year on a project in boston for which three people needed two-@@ and-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half months .
it was about a way to find parents who can find the right public schools for their kids .
we were told later that if it were going to go over the normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken it over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing at all .
there &apos;s a project right now in california law , which the tax@@ pa@@ yer has now taken two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an ap@@ p , which is written in a few days , and then it &apos;s a kind of a waste before the bo@@ ss , is a kind of sc@@ ore of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , like a lot of people think that it should be .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free attra@@ ction , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s very important .
but more importantly about this ap@@ p is that it represents a new generation that is pac@@ king the problem of government -- not as the problem of a pl@@ ated institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and it &apos;s a very good problem because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at colle@@ cting digital technology with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who produce the tools that we need to make things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &apos;s rock wars , there are hundreds of people all over the country who are writing and writing government app@@ s , everyday every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re sc@@ ared with you , but they don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in about it , but they don &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d them .
and these guys know something that we &apos;ve lost out of the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all feel your feelings about politics and the sna@@ ke to meet and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , is government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have to give up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of these people that i want you to think about , i want you to think about it , because the things change .
politics don &apos;t change ; the government is in the change .
and because the government finally fa@@ ked their power out of us -- remember , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we &apos;re thinking about it , how we think about it , it will affect how this change
i didn &apos;t know very much about government , when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought that the government was basically about choo@@ sing people in a san@@ ch@@ ard .
now , after two years , i started to conclu@@ de that it &apos;s mostly about community , about ta@@ pe rat@@ ings .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually come out there when you &apos;re calling in your city 3@@ 11 .
if you &apos;ve ever had the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scot@@ t ris@@ del@@ man as part of the program — in fact , they do it -- you &apos;ll see that the people who call the government for many different problems , including that a th@@ um@@ ga@@ ge in your house is .
so scot@@ t gets this as@@ ser@@ f .
he ti@@ ps &quot; bac@@ op@@ ops &quot; into the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and he &apos;s not really an idea . he &apos;s cat@@ ching up with the man .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors in your house , and very l@@ oud music play and see if the li@@ ve@@ stock dro@@ p ? &quot;
and that worked . appl@@ ause for scot@@ t .
but that was not the end of the bal@@ tel@@ u@@ es .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it &apos;s got an ap@@ p , a web and cell ap@@ p , called &quot; citizens signals . &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this ap@@ p .
this is the work very smart people in the village of the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
one day -- this is a actual report -- came in : &quot; att@@ abo@@ ks in my g@@ arb@@ age . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them out ? &quot;
but what happens with citizens link , &quot; is different .
scot@@ t carefully insi@@ sted from man to man .
but in citizens , everything is publi@@ c@@ ly available , so that everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighb@@ able neighb@@ or .
and the next one that we got was , &quot; i went over there , came over , the g@@ arb@@ age ring behind the house .
mar@@ ran@@ s ? yes . life ? y@@ ap .
the waste bul@@ let went on the page . went home .
good night , swe@@ et th@@ att@@ n@@ ings . &quot;
it &apos;s pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is where the digital is physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of a platform .
i &apos;m going to talk more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help other people .
a citi@@ zen helped another citi@@ zen , but the government was played a central role here .
they ser@@ ve these two people .
and they could have taken them with government services if that was needed , but a neighb@@ or is much better and che@@ aper to be a neighb@@ or and che@@ aper alternative to state services .
if one neighb@@ or helps others , we create our communities .
we call the person who , a lot of money , is a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the other input of the other .
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is vot@@ ed .
how often we have elec@@ ted a political leaders -- and sometimes we &apos;ve taken a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we d@@ end back , and we expect the government , our values and our needs , and then we expect our needs , and then it doesn &apos;t change much ?
that is because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top 15@@ -@@ centi@@ meter .
and what &apos;s below is that what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
and we use this word with such de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing .
but it &apos;s this de@@ or@@ t that this thing that we have and for which we pay is something we &apos;re paying for , that works against us , something else , and then we design ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sex@@ y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ c@@ y sex@@ y .
because this is where the actual govern@@ ance is happening .
we need to put ourselves on the machin@@ ery of the government .
so the occu@@ pi@@ ic@@ e@@ al movement has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of wor@@ thy citizens who wrote a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report , which is an answer to the star mem@@ o about the &quot; offen@@ sive re@@ form of the legal re@@ form .
that &apos;s not poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active .
now , for those of us who have been given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about it , about the world that we want to leave to our children .
you &apos;ve got to show you the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really think that we &apos;re achie@@ ving what we need to do without the institution that can act in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely important , but it needs to become more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to re@@ view the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by streng@@ th@@ ening society .
and there &apos;s one generation that &apos;s grown up to the internet , and who knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build really systems .
now , the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation of older than most of you .
this is a generation that has grown up to see their voice as a strange one .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we &apos;re all fighting , who can talk to who speak ; they all agree .
you can express your opini@@ on on every chan@@ nel at every time , and you do .
so , if you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write appli@@ cations that en@@ han@@ ce the labor of government .
and these app@@ s allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be to get a hy@@ dr@@ ant rele@@ ase , cr@@ our@@ k to paint a g@@ arb@@ age , turn a g@@ arb@@ age tube with a th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine .
and sure , we would have to burn these hy@@ dr@@ ants all the time , and a lot of people do this .
but these app@@ s are like small digital memor@@ ies that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we are not just consu@@ sing the government that are recei@@ ving contro@@ ls and services .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re a citi@@ zen .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government unless we improve the citi@@ zen citi@@ zen@@ ship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got here for you : when it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re just going to be a lot of vot@@ es , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role is to explain people how wonderful the new technologies that are on the rise , will be . and i thought , well , because i &apos;m here under friends , i would tell you what i really think , and also try to look back and understand what &apos;s really happening with these incredible le@@ ases forward to front , which is so quickly that we can bar@@ ely get to sleep .
i &apos;m going to start with you brie@@ fly a single , bor@@ ing slide .
... maybe you could just show the slide .
this is a slide that i happen to cho@@ se from my cre@@ ator , at the
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , it &apos;s about the general shape .
this slide shows data an analysis of an analysis of ris@@ c process@@ ors as compared to the performance of a block of cyber@@ block networks .
now , what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , as some of us , that we often meet in our field , a kind of just on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a poten@@ cy in the performance .
and that &apos;s a psychology that we have to use this type of scale to se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves in technology in technology .
something very od@@ d happens here .
that &apos;s basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you want to pull the light back .
something else , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graph@@ s in technology to se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves ?
the reason for this is , if i dou@@ br@@ ated it on a normal cur@@ ve , where , say , this is the years , which is the ti@@ mel@@ ine of a species , and this is a random measure of technology that i want to show with a graph , is going to be the graph al@@ b@@ ber .
they look like it &apos;s like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now if i want to print a different technology , let &apos;s say a transpor@@ tation technology , then that would be very un@@ reas@@ able on the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic scale , in shape of a flat line .
but if something like this happens here , it changes the artic@@ e@@ al@@ ative conditions .
so if the transpor@@ tation technology would continue as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology technology , then we could go into a tax@@ i , and in 30 seconds , we could be in to@@ k@@ yo .
but it doesn &apos;t get that fast .
now , this has never been done in the history of technology , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth , by which the scale of scale is exponenti@@ ally increasing for all many years .
the question that i want to ask you now is , when you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you can see , they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever is evol@@ ving for forever and forever .
there are two op@@ tions .
either it &apos;s going to get a classi@@ c min@@ us cur@@ ve like this , until something fundament@@ ally emerging , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
now , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think something like this will happen in the way here .
that really means , well , we &apos;re here right now in the middle of a transi@@ tion .
we &apos;re on this line here , in a transition from the everyday world to a new kind of world .
so the question that i want to ask and also often , is like a lot of myself , is going to be like this new world ?
what is this new condition that slowly redu@@ ces the world ?
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using , when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people are talking about the future , and you can see that the future is still in 2000 .
moving forward than we don &apos;t go .
so in other words , the future is s@@ hr@@ in@@ king a year since i &apos;m in this world .
i think the reason for that is that we realize that there is something under@@ going .
the transition is happening . we all feel it .
and we know that it &apos;s just not a sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years now in the future , because everything is going to be so different , that a simple extra@@ ction of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
i want to talk about what this might be , this transition that we &apos;re currently at right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk first about a couple of other things that really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to go a step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the time scale of the earth .
i think the big picture makes sense when you divi@@ de it into a number of billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and 22 and a billion billion years , the earth was a big , ster@@ i@@ le stone that flo@@ ats with many of these on chemicals .
so if you look at how these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they did that .
i also believe there are theor@@ ies that start understanding like all of r@@ na started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ stic story of what is that at that time , little oil dro@@ p@@ let , which con@@ tain different kinds of reci@@ pes for chemicals .
some of these oil dro@@ p@@ let forces infe@@ cted a special combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed them to integra@@ te other chemicals from outside and so to grow .
and they were all that , started to divi@@ de .
these little oil dro@@ p@@ let was the most primi@@ tive cell lo@@ cks in the sense .
but these oil dro@@ w@@ ning dro@@ ps were not about alive in today , because every single one was just a small , acci@@ dent@@ al reci@@ pe of chemicals .
and each time it divi@@ ded , the resul@@ ted chemicals have been distribu@@ ted to un@@ pre@@ cis@@ ely amo@@ unts of chemicals
so every dro@@ p@@ let was a little bit different .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ let grew the dro@@ ps that had one for the growth of the co@@ ber , faster than others and more and more chemicals out of them and shared spee@@ ding faster .
so these ap@@ p is to survive longer and they spread in lar@@ gely exp@@ ange@@ ment .
so this is just a very simple chemical form , but more interesting it will be if this dro@@ p@@ let learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , this dri@@ p tan@@ te has the ability to learn information pre@@ vent@@ ing information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the pres@@ cri@@ ption of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found a way in this spi@@ ritual , evolutionary way that allowed them to fa@@ ke down what they were out of , so that this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ i@@ ed .
and the amazing thing is that this kind of information to store information over the time of 2.@@ 5 billion years where it &apos;s been born , right ?
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , of the ex@@ act same code and the same magni@@ fi@@ cent .
and that is that every cre@@ ature uses exactly the same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re so far , we can write into this code , to write ourselves in this code .
and i have 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of a white impul@@ se , which i try to keep in air@@ por@@ ts on the air@@ por@@ ts of security men .
it &apos;s in there -- what i did is , i took this code -- the code is made of regular letter , which we use to be symbo@@ li@@ zed -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve combin@@ ed it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants to have someone on a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even anyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had a e@@ go@@ ar@@ re , then i would have written it on a virus and rele@@ ase into the room .
so , what &apos;s the next step ?
the measure of the dna was an interesting step .
and that ble@@ w these cells -- it made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s because these cells started to communicate and to exchange information , so that communities of cells emer@@ ged .
i don &apos;t know if you knew this already , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
that &apos;s why , for example , the en@@ dur@@ ance to antibio@@ tics is growing .
some bacteria have figured out how to keep reach@@ ing from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and they &apos;ve written this information with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
this communication en@@ ab@@ led the practice of communities , which were in a certain sense in the same boat , they were sy@@ ner@@ ge@@ tic .
so they &apos;re either survi@@ ved together , or they were going under together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of community were repe@@ ated more and more by evolution .
the transition line is there is where these communities led so close that they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community into a drawing chain on the entire community .
and the next exciting phase took about another billion years .
at this stage , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of many different kinds of cell types that together work as an individual organis@@ m .
indeed , we are also a multi-@@ cell@@ enti@@ tural community .
we have a lot of cells that are not fac@@ ed on itself .
your skin cells are aff@@ ord@@ able with no heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started developing , so that the level that the evolution was based on , no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community , which we call the organis@@ m .
the next step is happening within these communities .
the cell communities began to abstra@@ ct information again .
and they developed specific structures that did nothing else than the information within the organis@@ m .
and here these are the neu@@ ral structures .
so the neurons are the information process@@ ing appar@@ at@@ us that these cell communities have built .
they started forming speci@@ alists within the community , specific structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and pi@@ cking up information .
and this was the brain and the neu@@ ral system of these communities .
and this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this moment , an individual -- learning now within the time of an individual organis@@ m , rather than this evolutionary range of time .
so an organis@@ m could learn , for example , to eat a particular fru@@ it , because she was bad and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
this could now be within the lifetime of an individual organis@@ m , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be evolution@@ arily learned by the individuals that died through this ferti@@ li@@ ze , because these information process@@ ing structures were not there yet .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process of development through this particular information of information , because evolution could now take within an individual .
it could take on a time learning in a time learning .
what happened after@@ wards is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
so , for example , the most resili@@ ent to what we think is the most exciting version of this communication man@@ ner is human language .
but it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , un@@ lo@@ zz@@ y and conf@@ used idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and giving basically stun@@ ning sounds of me , in which hope to create a simil@@ arly conf@@ used idea in your head that has a simil@@ ar@@ ity of simil@@ ar@@ ity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , conver@@ ting it into sound , a sequence of sound , and producing something very complicated with it in the head of others .
so this allows us to act again as a uni@@ vi@@ al organis@@ m .
and what we actually did is , we , humanity , is , we started abstra@@ ct .
we &apos;re going through the same strat@@ ars that have trans@@ formed several cell organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds , how we stop data .
so the invention of language , for example , was a small step in that direction .
tele@@ ony , computers , video inter@@ faces , c@@ d ro@@ ms , so far , all of our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we &apos;ve built in our community to be able to hand@@ le this information .
and it conne@@ cts all of us together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also able to evol@@ ve faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the sp@@ an of micro@@ seconds .
you can also see t@@ y &apos;s little evolutionary example where he showed a little bit of evolution in the con@@ vol@@ lation program , right in front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve wa@@ sted the time scen@@ es again .
the first stage of the story i told you , did a billion years of a piece per piece .
the next steps , like the ner@@ ve system and the brain , la@@ sted a couple hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , la@@ sted less than a million years .
and those next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , would seem to take just a few decades .
the process fe@@ e@@ ds from itself , and it becomes , i think , a car cat@@ aly@@ tical is the word for it -- if something rein@@ forced his change rate .
but the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explo@@ sion@@ ing cur@@ ve .
we &apos;re looking at the process that e@@ ats from itself .
i &apos;ve been living from building computers from computers , and i know that i could build the mechanis@@ ms that i use to build computers , without the recent achie@@ vement in the computer technology .
my current focus is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transi@@ st@@ or does in the making of the making .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
what i &apos;m doing , and what makes the designers of vision , is , we think , a kind of abstra@@ ct level , re@@ duc@@ ing this machine , and the machine , and make it something that goes far beyond our cap@@ abilities , better and faster than we could ever do it yourself .
and it makes it par@@ tly with metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t even really understand until that now .
one way that &apos;s interesting is , and which i &apos;ve used a lot recently , is evolution itself .
so we &apos;ve inst@@ all@@ ed an evolutionary process in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the micro@@ second .
so to say one example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that developed from random in@@ struc@@ tions .
we say , &quot; computer , gener@@ ic pal@@ es in a hundred million rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ sen genes of in@@ struc@@ tions .
now , please take all of these random cho@@ sen in@@ struc@@ tions , take all the programs , and choose those ones which my previous interests are the clo@@ s@@ est to . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;m going to tell what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to define numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve already used for this .
so , you find programs which can counter@@ act the most the first numbers .
of course , the chance of rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ sen in@@ struc@@ tions is very small that they &apos;re just partici@@ ating rand@@ ases , so there are none of the in@@ struc@@ tions that are actually going to do this .
but one of them might like with some lucky to put two numbers in the right order .
now , i say , &quot; computer , take those 10 percent of the sequences that got my previous interests the next .
celebra@@ te that off , save the rest .
now all of the common causes that are contribu@@ ted to numbers are the numbers that contribu@@ tes numbers .
and it &apos;s with a method of re@@ combin@@ ing , anal@@ o@@ g to re@@ production . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children ex@@ port the properties of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs .
so , i now have a new generation of programs that emer@@ ged by combin@@ ations of programs that got slightly closer to the advantage than others .
say , &quot; please repe@@ at this process . &quot;
ac@@ com@@ mo@@ dat@@ ed them .
perhaps a few mu@@ tations . &quot;
and let &apos;s try this again with another generation .
all of these generations cost just a few milli@@ seconds .
and so i can leave an evolution over millions of years in a computer in a few minutes , or in a more complicated cases .
eventually , i &apos;m designing programs that can actually repli@@ c@@ ate numbers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever been able to write by hand .
so when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
it &apos;s ob@@ no@@ lic@@ e and weird programs .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you get from a series of hundreds of thousands of programs that i &apos;ve done the job .
because your life depen@@ ded on whether they &apos;re doing the job right .
i sat down in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 together with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , ellen it contra@@ cted a map , and she says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s , in this airplane , there is hundreds of thousands of pieces that work together to make your flight sa@@ fer . don &apos;t you do that to yourself ? &quot;
we know that a process of development is not opti@@ mal when it gets too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to leave on computers , for a process that is a lot different from classi@@ cal engineering .
it allows us things to be a much higher complexity than the normal way of producing the normal way of producing .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the cap@@ abilities of that .
so , in some sense , technology fl@@ atten@@ ed us .
so we use these programs to make the computers a lot faster , so that we can be able to make that proce@@ d@@ ure faster .
so , it buil@@ ds a feedback .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so puzz@@ ling .
because all of these new technologies of themselves are fe@@ eding by themselves .
we &apos;re going down .
we have come at a point that is at the time , the anal@@ o@@ g , as a single sub-@@ cell organisms have developed into multi-@@ cell organisms .
so we are the amo@@ e@@ br@@ ands , and we can &apos;t quite do what the hell we &apos;re actually capable of is capable of .
we &apos;re in the middle of this transition .
but i really believe that after us comes something else .
i find it very highly eff@@ or@@ t@@ ful to say that we are the end products of evolution .
and i think we all are here part of the creation of what comes next .
now , the lunch is standing before , and i think i &apos;m listening to here now before i &apos;m going to pick up .
my story starts to start right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , about two years ago .
i was under the star@@ tu@@ p of desert in the desert with su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the era of the ancient indian e@@ po@@ s of &quot; ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a .
if we wanted to travel in indi@@ ans , we jum@@ ped into a car , and we s@@ nat@@ ched over the sky .
now we &apos;re going through this with air@@ planes .
at the time , when the great indian war@@ ri@@ a war@@ ri@@ a had thir@@ ded , he took a bo@@ w , sho@@ ot@@ ed into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re making this with dri@@ ll@@ s and machines .
we came to the conclu@@ sion that the magic and magic have been re@@ placed by machines .
that was really sad to me .
i got a little sc@@ ared of technology .
it was afraid that i could lose the ability to be able to enjoy sun@@ sets without camera and a t@@ we@@ et with my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father had me to give me his little sil@@ ver ta@@ ir .
this piece of 50 year-old technology became the most i@@ vi@@ c thing for me .
she became a gold access to a world full of pig@@ s and failed ves@@ sel@@ s and to images in my imagination .
it made me think it was as though our reading and c@@ ameras were leaving us beyond .
they thought about being inspired by them .
and so i enga@@ ged into the world of technology to see how i could use ma@@ gical rather than killing it .
when i was 16 , i started to illu@@ strate books .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a device to story@@ telling , to connect the re@@ a@@ der in the world .
it can know how we usually do it .
it can know where we are .
it thro@@ ws pictures and spea@@ ks together , and anima@@ tion , sound and touch .
the story@@ telling has always la@@ kes more true .
but what do we do with this ?
now i &apos;m just going to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
here it says , &quot; put your fing@@ ers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here it says , &quot; that box has heard ... &quot; i &apos;m writing my name .
and it becomes me in a character in the book .
and then , again , a letter for me falls down -- and the i@@ pad knows through gps where i live -- which is right to me .
the inf@@ ant in me is really enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic of these possibilities .
i talked a lot about ma@@ gical magic .
i don &apos;t mean ma@@ gi@@ cians and dra@@ ots , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
fire@@ flies in a glass i found constantly exciting .
that &apos;s how you have to shed the i@@ pad and let the giant signals behind .
and the way that light is through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascin@@ ates me as a child can put a whole galaxy in a single mar@@ ble .
and so there will be every book , and every world is a little mar@@ ble that i &apos;m going to push here to the magic machine in the machine .
and that &apos;s what op@@ ens a map .
now fan@@ t@@ y@@ books had always been maps , but these cards were sta@@ tic .
this map gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and ser@@ ves to re@@ ori@@ entation in the rest of the book .
it shows you in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that is in@@ dis@@ ar , but also very gradu@@ ally .
so these are the ap@@ bur@@ as .
we &apos;ve all heard of fe@@ es and n@@ y@@ mp@@ s , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ bur@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ bur@@ as were caught thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ a cham@@ bers in an old mu@@ ff@@ le book .
and we bring them back in a con@@ temporary narra@@ tive for children .
a story that dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es new issues , like the environmental crisis .
so for the future of environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , without going out of their computers , without getting out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
so , in an interaction of the book you &apos;re sent to a search , you have to go out and analy@@ ze with the camera of the i@@ pa@@ l images of natural objects .
when i was a kid , i had colle@@ ctions of speaking , st@@ ones , bul@@ bs and sh@@ ells .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is a foun@@ ant ritual to get back , and you have to go out to make a picture of a flo@@ wer in a chap@@ ter and tag it .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to photograph a piece of scan@@ ning , scan@@ ning a piece of tree .
and so you can actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a fo@@ ster , and he says , &quot; oh , today i saw a fo@@ e . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a mon@@ key today . &quot;
this creates a kind of a social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you &apos;ve actually colle@@ cted .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities that produce magic , that connect the world and technology .
and so in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you used the video of the i@@ pad , and by aug@@ mented reality , an anima@@ tion of clo@@ r@@ es that appear on a plant before the house .
on one spot , the screen with leaves colli@@ ded with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the win@@ ds , b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
we all move on a world where the forces of technology come closer and can happen in magic and technology in the magic and the technology .
we &apos;re using the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you very much .
this is really quite an extraordinary honor to me .
i spend most of my time with people in rec@@ ru@@ it , pris@@ ons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the so@@ cially fru@@ strated in the social broad@@ stream and places where there are a lot of hope .
to be here at ted , to see and hear how stimul@@ ating this is , i gave me a lot of force .
in the short time here , i was clear to you : ted has a identity .
you can say things that have influence all over the world .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it has a signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce and a force that doesn &apos;t exist otherwise .
i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
i think we learned that the words of a teacher matter , but that &apos;s the words of a de@@ dic@@ ated prac@@ tor are especially meaning@@ ful .
as a physi@@ cian , you can do good , but you can do more than a care@@ ist , but you can do more .
and because of that , i want to talk about the power of identity .
by the way , i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a law@@ yer .
i learned about this from my grandmother .
i was raised in a family , an traditional african se@@ ven@@ -@@ american hou@@ se@@ hold , who was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ it@@ in , and this matri@@ ar@@ e-@@ was my grandmother .
she was a ta@@ pe , strong woman , she had an effect .
she had the last sentence in every family argument .
she was also the starting point on many of our family tradi@@ tions .
she was the daughter of a sla@@ v@@ or family .
their parents were born in virg@@ ini@@ a in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s when sla@@ ves were born .
it was born around 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very sha@@ ped their world image very stron@@ g@@ ly .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also very f@@ ond .
when i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and i mur@@ gl@@ ed me .
she started to stru@@ ck me so that i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the , then she let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you feel like my hu@@ e ? &quot;
and when i said no , they hu@@ g me again . if i said , she hu@@ gs me . if i said , they let me .
she was something that wor@@ ned that you wanted to be near her .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cou@@ s@@ ins ate all over .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine , that i wo@@ ke up one in the morning and went to the living room , all my cou@@ s@@ ins flo@@ ating around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of my bedro@@ om , and star@@ ing at me .
at first , i thought that that would be a game .
i looked at her and i s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very serious .
and that &apos;s 15 or 20 minutes , and then she got up and she came to me . she took me to my hand , and she said , &quot; come , br@@ y@@ an . you and i have to talk . &quot;
i still remember , like , it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t let it go . &quot;
i said , &quot; let &apos;s simpli@@ fy , grand@@ a . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , hon@@ ey word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat me up , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve obser@@ ved you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a little special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything what you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , gran@@ ny . &quot;
she said , &quot; when i first leave your queen you will always love your queen . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom@@ my is my baby , and you have to promise with you that you &apos;re always going to care for you . &quot;
so i cover my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , om@@ a , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , next i &apos;ll always leave that you &apos;re going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to stop doing the right thing
and i thought , &quot; yes , ma . i promise this . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to say to me is , you &apos;re never going to drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , gran@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up in the farm , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who is older and a year yo@@ unger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and i took this six@@ lo@@ ck be@@ er with my sister and i and i went to the forest and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just s@@ mil@@ ed around and around as well .
and then he took a drink be@@ er and off@@ ered my sister one , and she accep@@ ted , and then they mat@@ ched me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , ok . thank you . i don &apos;t want to do a be@@ er . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; now , let &apos;s do this , you &apos;re doing everything else that we &apos;re doing .
i had what , your sister had what . let &apos;s drink a be@@ er . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do you . you just do . &quot;
my brother was star@@ ing at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? now , trin@@ k . &quot;
and then he looked at me on the face , and said , &quot; oh , no , you &apos;re not going to do crazy because of the conversation with gran@@ ny ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grand@@ ma spea@@ ks to all the ti@@ ckets that you are special . &quot;
and i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
i &apos;m going to bel@@ ong to you .
i don &apos;t want to do that .
this may be medi@@ cally transpor@@ ted to it .
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m never dr@@ ash a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
i &apos;m not saying this because i believe it &apos;s virtu@@ ous . i say this , because identity is making identity .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all of her grand@@ children , they &apos;re something special .
my grand@@ father was in prison in the pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
my un@@ cle died of al@@ co@@ hol hospit@@ onic diseases .
and she believed that these are the top@@ ics that we needed to care about .
i &apos;ve been trying to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people were in gro@@ wer@@ ing and in ja@@ il .
today , it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states now have the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world .
seven million people are dis@@ placed to jud@@ gment or with opposite law deli@@ very .
in my opini@@ on , mass in@@ fu@@ ti@@ zation has changed our world .
in social si@@ ck@@ les and black parts of the population of des@@ pair and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of these changes .
one out of three men from 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on ambi@@ tion , or with no law deli@@ very .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles on a tour of phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in prison , in prison , on jud@@ gment , or with low-@@ law .
but our system is not only sculp@@ ted by questions that have to do with law@@ ling , it &apos;s also syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing by poverty .
we have an justi@@ tory system in this country that are much better to treat , when they &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and inno@@ cent .
so , wealth , not de@@ bt , influence the out@@ come .
yet , we seem to be quite happy about it .
now , a politics of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are a couple of very interesting develop@@ ments .
my own state of al@@ ab@@ ama is de@@ plo@@ yed them perman@@ ently when they &apos;re sent@@ en@@ ged to be sent@@ enced .
here in al@@ ab@@ ama , 3@@ 4 percent of the male black population are perman@@ ently lost their vot@@ es .
we &apos;re proje@@ cting that in 10 years , the ad@@ ju@@ des of recogni@@ tion of the ci@@ vi@@ c honest state is going to be as high as before the vot@@ ing of ele@@ ction law .
the sil@@ ence is o@@ un@@ d@@ matic .
i negoti@@ ated kids .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world that con@@ vi@@ cted 3@@ 10 children die to death in prison .
in this country , there are dea@@ ths of life without in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ation with the poor law .
we already have a lot of proce@@ dur@@ es running .
it &apos;s the only country in the world .
i negoti@@ ated people in death cells .
now the death pen@@ al@@ ty question is an interesting question .
we think because we &apos;ve taught it so that the real question that is : has a man ear@@ ned to die for an adult doc@@ al ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but again , we can think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not , has somebody ear@@ n death for an crime , but , did we deser@@ ve to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is re@@ plac@@ s by er@@ ror .
on nine people we have ex@@ ecu@@ ted , they come one that we did for inno@@ cent , that was de@@ pu@@ ted and left out of the death floor .
an amazing er@@ ror program . one of the nine inno@@ cent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let somebody fly with an airplane , when for nine planes that falls down , down one down .
but somehow , we manage to stit@@ ch ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m a lot of these questions about these questions .
i talk about race , and the question is , can we kill the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m saving my students af@@ ro@@ american history . i &apos;m talking about sla@@ very .
i talk about terror@@ ism , the time against the end of the second re@@ construction , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a very much about it .
but for the afri@@ can@@ -@@ americans in this country , it was a time of ter@@ ror .
people had to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs in many areas .
or do it go about bom@@ bs .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror who sha@@ ped their life .
these older people are coming to me now and say , &quot; mom , ste@@ ven@@ son , you &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re saying , they &apos;re saying to say that we have to do it for the first time in our nation with terror@@ ism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terror@@ ism , , of course , the dec@@ ele@@ gation and decades of the tar@@ si@@ ble motiv@@ ated sur@@ ren@@ der and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d .
and yet , there is a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand the meaning of our actions in the histor@@ ic context .
we &apos;re always keeping on each other .
we &apos;re creating new ten@@ sions and confli@@ cts .
we &apos;re hard to talk about race , and i believe that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to approach the process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in south africa , people have understood that the am@@ pli@@ tion is not over to over@@ come the will@@ ing@@ ness to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
even after the geno@@ cide in r@@ wand@@ a , there was this kind of happiness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve held a few talks in germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly dist@@ ur@@ bing to hear them . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and of course , they can never give them more in germany . &quot;
it became completely sil@@ ent , and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever have another question for the syste@@ matic kill of people .
it would be reas@@ on@@ able of us , consci@@ ously , consci@@ ously and able to reach people . &quot;
and i was thinking about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where the ger@@ man state had left people everywhere , especially if there were a lot of je@@ ws under them .
it would be ir@@ au@@ si@@ ble .
it would be wor@@ th@@ less .
and yet , here in this country , in the old south states states , we tend to be sent@@ enced -- here &apos;s the risk to death , when the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce is white than if the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce is white than if it &apos;s black . 22 times lower , when the en@@ broken black is the appropriate black people in their earth , whose earth knows the body of known people .
and yet , there is this mental dis@@ integra@@ te .
i think , our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these difficult top@@ ics , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we &apos;re love innovation .
we love to love technology and creativity .
we &apos;re learning entertain@@ ment .
but ultimately , these reali@@ ties are f@@ used by suffering , ab@@ use , re@@ ab@@ ti@@ lation , out@@ determin@@ ation .
i seem to think it &apos;s important to uni@@ te both .
because we &apos;re ultimately talking about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commit@@ ment , to exist in a complex world .
for me , to bring to think and to talk about the poor , and to talk about the poor that are dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ged that will never be at ted .
but think about a way that is em@@ bed@@ ded in our own lives .
we all have to believe the things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so rational as we appreci@@ ate intelle@@ ct .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t come just from our minds .
they come from ideas that are driven by per@@ su@@ asi@@ on in our he@@ arts .
it &apos;s this head@@ -@@ heart connection , where i think it &apos;s pus@@ hing us , not only to be open for all the light and ambi@@ tions of things , but also for the dark and proble@@ matic .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ vel , the great c@@ ze@@ mic politicians , once said .
&quot; when we f@@ ought in eastern europe against the ero@@ sion , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most was hope , a spi@@ ritual ori@@ entation , the will@@ ing@@ ness , sometimes in hop@@ ab@@ less places to be wit@@ ness , to be wit@@ ness . &quot;
this intellectual ori@@ entation is the heart of what i believe is that the ted communities have to engage to do this .
there is no interven@@ tion about technology and design that allows us to be completely human , until we have eyes and e@@ ars for poverty , dep@@ th and in@@ justice .
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity doesn &apos;t assu@@ me a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t understand it .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young law@@ yer , i hat@@ ed the great privi@@ lege to meet p@@ ink par@@ ks .
woman par@@ ks came back again to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ i , where they were tra@@ il@@ ing two of their ol@@ dest friends . these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r , who had organized the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ i bus bo@@ y@@ k@@ ot@@ t -- an incredible afri@@ can@@ -@@ american -- and virg@@ ini@@ a lang@@ r , a white custom@@ man , ji@@ ff@@ son ris@@ r , dr. king ep@@ at .
so these women were meeting , and they just sett@@ led .
and then , mr. car@@ r schu@@ to me then and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , m@@ ack@@ y , m@@ ours comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want you to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , well , i love . &quot;
and she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over , and i just stopped .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so it was so in@@ her@@ ent .
and one day , i was there and listen@@ ed to this women , and after a couple of hours , he turned to me about , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me about us , &quot; which is the ex@@ act right to me , what it &apos;s supposed to do for equal right .
what &apos;s going to try to achieve ? &quot;
i started off with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get ourselves against ir@@ mor@@ cy .
w@@ r want to help people who were inno@@ cent de@@ cent .
we want to fight bi@@ ases and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al justice system .
we want to elimin@@ ate li@@ fel@@ ong death sent@@ ences without kids without fail@@ ing cri@@ mes for children .
we want to do something against the death pen@@ al@@ ty companies .
we want to reduce the number of pris@@ on@@ ers .
we want to rele@@ ase mass in@@ car@@ ti@@ ment . &quot;
so i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me , and i said , &quot; y@@ um . m@@ um . okay
she said , &quot; this is going to make it very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
then , mr. mother , le@@ wart , got to me , put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you need to be very , very bra@@ ve . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be ta@@ il@@ er .
we need to connect ways . we have to connect to these challenges : this problem , this ti@@ lt .
because ultimately our humanity , by our humanity , is depen@@ dent on our humanity .
and in my work , i learned very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of very simple things .
that we all are more , as the worst we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
when a person lies , it &apos;s not just a li@@ ar .
when someone kno@@ cks something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to him , it &apos;s not just a th@@ um@@ b .
even who kill@@ s someone , it &apos;s not just a mur@@ derer .
and because that &apos;s , there is a basic human dig@@ ni@@ ty that needs to respect the laws .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with sure in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is dis@@ enti@@ tude .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s .
i think , in many places , the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty
and finally , i think , even though it &apos;s so dra@@ matic and so powerful and in@@ spir@@ ing , we end not at the end of our technology , not in the things that we develop , not in the things that we develop , not in our intelle@@ ct and minds .
after all , a society is not measu@@ red in terms of how they treated their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but by how they rel@@ ate to the poor , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
because in this context , we &apos;re only beginning to gras@@ p the actual amazing things that make us out .
sometimes i forget that balance . a story end up .
sometimes i go too much .
i &apos;m going to be ti@@ red , just like we all .
sometimes these ideas are fore@@ ning our thinking in a very important way .
i negoti@@ ated these kids who were sent@@ enced to very hard sent@@ ences .
i go to the local prison , and i visit a las@@ er who may be 13 or 14 years old , and it should be as adults to court .
so i ask myself , how could it happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn someone into something that it is not ?
the ju@@ dge looks at him as a adults , but i see a child .
and one night , i sta@@ yed up too long , and i thought , my goo@@ dness , if one ju@@ dge can turn us into something else , then he has to have ma@@ mor@@ s .
in fact , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has ma@@ ts .
you should have some sti@@ cks too .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think really hard , i started working on a pres@@ identi@@ al appe@@ ad .
i had a 14@@ -year-old , poor black boys than a volunte@@ er .
and i started with this note , the head@@ line said , &quot; y@@ or@@ ing , my poor , 14@@ -year-old black off@@ ers tre@@ ating a privi@@ le@@ ged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old national mana@@ gers . &quot;
in my commit@@ ment , i expla@@ ined that mis@@ actions of the government and police and the ele@@ ction were to consider fail@@ ures .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there was nothing more knowledge in this country , that there is only fal@@ ths .
the next morning , i wo@@ ke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i dre@@ w this crazy stat@@ ement or even written it .
and on my de@@ fau@@ lt , i had written him not only , but i sent him to the court .
a few months passed over and i had for@@ gotten about it .
but finally , i decided , my god , i had to make myself into the cour@@ ts and this crazy arr@@ ange@@ ment .
i got into the car , and i was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
so i went to the front of the cri@@ st .
and i thought it was going to be so heavy , so pain@@ ful .
finally , i got out of my car , and i took the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court .
when i got up the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court , there was an el@@ der@@ ly , black man who was the jan@@ it@@ or in the court .
and as he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
then he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to bet you . &quot;
and i have to say , it gave me power@@ ness .
it made something very deep in me , identity , the ability of each individual to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i condu@@ cted the cour@@ c@@ room .
and as soon as the ju@@ dge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you express this crazy phr@@ ase ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to disc@@ uss .
more and more people would come in , just because they were an@@ gry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in , and con@@ gre@@ ci@@ le state law@@ yers and office provi@@ ders .
in the pal@@ m of people , the cour@@ tor@@ ium of people who were an@@ gry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality .
from my sight , i saw the jan@@ it@@ or and down and go down .
he kept seeing himself through the window , and he could hear the whole to@@ hu@@ li@@ dr@@ u .
he stood up and down .
finally , this older black man came out in the cour@@ tro@@ om with a very concerned fac@@ ial out@@ turn in the cour@@ tro@@ om , almost behind me , almost on the defen@@ se bank .
10 minutes later , the ju@@ dge announ@@ ced a break .
and as we got a police off@@ ic@@ er , a police off@@ ic@@ er , which caused it to be the office in the cour@@ ch room .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in the cour@@ thou@@ pi@@ ium ? &quot;
and the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come out to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the target of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot; watch
i came to ted , because i think many of you have understood that the moral pen@@ k of the universe is far wi@@ ping out , but it &apos;s increasing the justice .
that we &apos;re not fully evol@@ ving as humans , as long as we deal with human rights and basic values .
that all of our lives is lin@@ ked with survival of each individual .
we have to connect our visi@@ ons of technology and design , of entertain@@ ment and creativity with humanity , p@@ ity and justice .
and most of all , i want to say that of those of you who see this simil@@ arly , just don &apos;t lose the target from the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you have seen in this audience , this community to see an obvious desire and know to help them and do something .
what can we do to do ?
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are ways of opportunity .
if you &apos;re living in california , there &apos;s a cen@@ su@@ s in this spring where it &apos;s about actually operating an effort to change something of the money stream that otherwise flo@@ ws into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
here , in california , for example , one billion dollars in the next five years is a billion dollars for the death pen@@ al@@ ty . a billion dollars .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of the kil@@ tery not comp@@ ell@@ ed with a con@@ fe@@ ction .
fi@@ gh@@ te@@ en percent of ra@@ pe cases not come to court in court .
here is the chance to do something .
this re@@ venue is going to pro@@ pose to invest money in more safety produ@@ cers and security .
i think there are possibilities all over .
over the last three decades , crimin@@ al rate is down im@@ men@@ se in america .
this fact is often being put into a relationship with the el@@ ev@@ ated in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers .
what would you say to someone who belie@@ ves that ?
well , in fact , the number of violent cri@@ mes didn &apos;t change very much .
most of the mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country didn &apos;t really found in the class of violent crime .
it was the failed cr@@ us@@ s versus drugs .
and so the dra@@ matic high paying numbers come in the prison pris@@ ers .
we got there to let us pun@@ ch from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
now we have &quot; three bro@@ a@@ ks &quot; laws that people have forever put behind bar , for a bi@@ ke the@@ ft , for the the@@ ft of low good good , instead of allo@@ wing them to give them the vic@@ ti@@ ms that things have dro@@ pped their vic@@ ti@@
i think we have to do more to help people who have become sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce vic@@ ti@@ ms , not less .
and i think our current notes of pun@@ ish@@ ment is not helping anybody .
well , i think that &apos;s what we have to change .
so br@@ y@@ an , they did really have a string to res@@ cu@@ e here .
they are an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
thank you very much you were at ted . thank you .
is left death brings a hei@@ ght home risk with itself .
two : fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . let &apos;s give you 3 : row spra@@ y of the police .
jim 4 : mal@@ -@@ bra@@ mp@@ le . he said 5 : dangerous jun@@ ting re@@ lief .
adam : social dec@@ line . seven : 65 dea@@ ths .
cambridge 8 : tsun@@ am@@ id war@@ lation . adam cher@@ ks : cyber@@ 9 attac@@ ks
various selling : drug war . weapons of mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
tour@@ ation . ev@@ ening . do@@ om@@ s@@ day . eg@@ y@@ pt . &#91; eg@@ ri@@ a .
crisis . death . it &apos;s ir@@ ri@@ c
god , oh my god .
so this is just a few of the cli@@ ps that i colle@@ cted over the last six months -- it would have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media pre@@ fer to show us normal subje@@ cts , because our minds are giving attention to these top@@ ics .
and there &apos;s a very good reason to do that .
every second of all , our senses are beginning to start much more information than our brain ever can .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first line for all the information is part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be , the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our ulti@@ mate war@@ ning system , our pet dete@@ ctor .
it contribu@@ tes and takes through the whole information , looking for any cla@@ im@@ ing of dan@@ ger in our environment .
so if we look at the news , we pre@@ fer to look for negative new laws .
and the old ada@@ ge , &quot; when it flo@@ ws , the demand gets the demand &quot; is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , which seven days a week , 24 hours a day , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not wonder that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
it &apos;s not wonder that everybody thinks it &apos;s the world and it &apos;s worse as worse .
but maybe , that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the real thing .
maybe the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century using a series of forces in the last century , so stron@@ g@@ ly that it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s possible to create a world of ab@@ und@@ ance in the next three decades .
well , i don &apos;t say that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , crisis , water and energy problems -- that we already have .
and as humans , we are much better at finding problems in very long ways , but they finally occasi@@ on@@ ally over@@ come .
so let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has more than dou@@ bled to the inf@@ lation of inf@@ all@@ ing average income states in the world population has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
child mortality has dec@@ um@@ it@@ ed by a tent@@ h .
and then the diet , electricity , transpor@@ tation and communication costs have more redu@@ ction of a multiple .
steve pin@@ ker has shown us that we are now living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history .
and according to charles ken@@ ny , the liter@@ acy rate has ris@@ en from 25 percent to 80 percent over the last 1@@ 30 years .
we &apos;re living in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people for@@ got this .
and we keep our expec@@ tations on contin@@ ually .
in fact , we &apos;ve re@@ defined poverty .
consider that a great percentage of americans that live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , telev@@ isi@@ ons , telev@@ isi@@ ons , climate contain@@ ers , condi@@ tives and cars .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists of the last century , the im@@ per@@ ators of the earth , would never have been able to dream such lux@@ ury goods .
the foundation for a lot of it develop@@ s technologies , and these growing ex@@ cess .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil showed us that every tool that becomes information technology , on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law &apos;s cur@@ ve , and at the price performance ow@@ o@@ ti@@ le , every 12 to 24 months dou@@ bled .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs on your po@@ cket about a million times less , and it &apos;s thousands times faster than a super@@ computer from the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
now , look at this cur@@ ve .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things about that cur@@ ve .
first , it &apos;s about wi@@ ping it -- in better times , war or peace , rec@@ ession , depression and high confli@@ cts , depression and high-@@ conflict .
this is the result of loo@@ se computers , the faster computers build faster computers .
and she slo@@ ws down for none of our big problems .
also , despite your log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic base on the left , it &apos;s increasing up@@ wards .
so , the growth rate itself is acceler@@ ating .
and on this cur@@ ve , on the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available all of them .
&quot; human computing , &quot; something that my friends call auto@@ des@@ k &quot; integra@@ te computers , &quot; sensor@@ s and networks , robots , robots , 3d pr@@ inter@@ s that allow it to democra@@ ti@@ ze personal production on our planet , syn@@ thetic biology , fuel , vac@@ cin@@ ation and food , digital medicine , nan@@ o-@@ materials .
how many of you have seen the vic@@ tory of ib@@ m super@@ computer in &quot; rich . &quot;
that was the ex@@ po@@ e .
i started doing the new@@ spa@@ pers and i looked for the best head@@ lines that i could find .
i love this one : &quot; wat@@ son con@@ tains human op@@ pon@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
so let &apos;s imagine that this artificial intelligence of each mobile phone ow@@ ners on a mobile phone .
four years ago , ray kurz@@ weil , and i started a new university here at ted , called sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
we bring our students all these technologies in , with a particular focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we &apos;re asking the students to create companies , products and services that can avoid healthy lives in a decade in a decade to avoid the lives of billions of people .
think about , a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
thir@@ te@@ en years ago , it would have been ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
today we can distribu@@ te to do@@ zens of companies who have made exactly this .
when i think of ab@@ und@@ ance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of lux@@ ury for everyone on this planet , it &apos;s to create a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating from pe@@ tty goods of ab@@ und@@ ance .
so sc@@ ar@@ city is exactly con@@ tex@@ tual , and technology is a resource that is liber@@ ating .
here &apos;s just an example .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ i@@ . in the middle of the 18@@ th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he got invited the king of si@@ am to dinner .
na@@ po@@ le@@ on soldiers car@@ ried sil@@ ver she@@ et , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself , the gold scri@@ p@@ ts .
the king of si@@ mal , however , got al@@ umin@@ um spr@@ ou@@ t .
al@@ umin@@ um was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and plat@@ at@@ ar .
this is why the dom@@ e of the washington mon@@ um@@ ent was made out of al@@ umin@@ um .
though al@@ umin@@ um takes 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it doesn &apos;t go as a p@@ ure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and si@@ bri@@ ties .
but then , the technology of electro@@ ly@@ se was developed , and made al@@ umin@@ um fe@@ eding so cheap that we use it with our s@@ f@@ end ment@@ ality .
then we &apos;re going to try to project these analog@@ y into the future .
we &apos;re thinking of energy sc@@ ar@@ city today .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet that &apos;s 5@@ ,000 times more energy than we consu@@ me a year .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of crow@@ d-@@ ter@@ restri@@ at@@ ers every 8@@ 8 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not sc@@ ar@@ city , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ bility .
and there &apos;s good news .
in that year , for the first time , they &apos;ve managed to reduce the cost of solar electricity in india to 50 percent of the same electricity -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ en , compared to 17 ru@@
solar power dro@@ ps for 50 percent last year .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that by the end of this decade in the sun@@ ny areas of the united states in the sun@@ ny areas of the united states , it &apos;s going to cost six cents a k@@ inning in the national average .
and if we have a power supply , then we &apos;ll have water on ab@@ und@@ ance .
let &apos;s talk about the water wars .
remember car@@ l sa@@ gan the vo@@ y@@ a@@ ger spac@@ ec@@ raft in 199@@ 0 , when it went by the saturn in 199@@ 0 , back to earth ?
he took it up a famous photograph . how was it done ?
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
because we &apos;re living on a water planet .
we live on a planet , which is 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent s@@ alt water , two percent of them gone , and we fight at 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
they &apos;re new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ologi@@ es on the way , nan@@ o-@@ materials .
and from a conversation this morning with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ators of the do , i want to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission -- his technical school , the &quot; bro@@ cker@@ shot , &quot; and many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s got the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation in the student home .
it can create a thousand gall@@ ons of clean water a day from different sources -- whether they have sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- and all of that for less than 2 cents a li@@ ter .
the board of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just decided to laun@@ ch a major test project with a hundred un@@ its in developing countries in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a is going to apply this technology glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries all over the planet .
this is technology suppor@@ ted innovation that are available today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones as well .
you &apos;re my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent de@@ ple@@ tion rate of mobile phones in developing countries in 20@@ 13 .
keep in mind that a mas@@ sa@@ che war@@ ri@@ or with a cell phone in kenya in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president re@@ ag@@ an 14 years ago .
and if you look with your smar@@ t@@ phones on google , they have more access to knowledge , and information as president clin@@ ton did 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in ab@@ und@@ ance , which nobody could have ever predi@@ cted .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you &apos;ve spent and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , h@@ d video and picture , libr@@ aries of books and music , the libr@@ aries of books and music , technology to medical diagno@@ stics -- they become literally em@@ pi@@ ti@@ zed and che@@ aper in their cell phone .
and best of all , it &apos;s probably what provi@@ des us in health care .
last month , i had the pleasure of the pain@@ t@@ ary foundation to announ@@ ce what &apos;s called &quot; $ 10 milli@@ quality com@@ ic tri@@ cor@@ des x prize . &quot;
we investi@@ gate teams around the world to connect all these technologies in a mobile phone so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s a@@ im@@ ed with ai , you can test pu@@ cken@@ , or your blood values .
and to win it , the device needs to turn a better diagno@@ stic teacher than a team developed .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are doctors , but 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den , and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care workers .
if this device sequen@@ ced a r@@ ust or dna virus that is not known , it &apos;s as@@ sum@@ ing the mini@@ stry of health , and pre@@ v@@ ents a pan@@ de@@ mic before its ar@@ ray .
but now to the biggest force that we &apos;re going to lead to a world of ab@@ und@@ ance .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for the population .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ dollar brand .
and just by the way , the biggest ab@@ sur@@ tion against a population explo@@ sion is a better education and food in the world .
in 2010 , we had so much connected under two billion people online .
by 20@@ 20 , we &apos;re going to move from two billion internet users .
three billion new parents , of whom we &apos;ve never heard before , will join global communication .
what are these people to need ?
what are you going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to desire ?
and instead of economic quie@@ t , i think i see one of the greatest economic en@@ dea@@ vor@@ s in history .
these people represent a few trillion dollars that are flo@@ wing into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be heal@@ thi@@ er by the use of the tri@@ co@@ der , and they &apos;re better educ@@ ated by the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by using the opportunity to use 3d pr@@ inter@@ s and frequ@@ enti@@ al computing , and be so much more productive than ever .
so what can three billion farmers , healthy , sophisti@@ cated , productive members of the people bring us to us ?
how about a sentence of new , un@@ heard of new , un@@ heard before .
how about , how would it be , the op@@ pres@@ sed , wher@@ ever you are to give a voice to hi@@ de and to create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring with ?
how about compli@@ ments that we don &apos;t even can predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that little teams who are motiv@@ ated by passi@@ passi@@ sts and focused are motiv@@ ated to create extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and government in the past .
i want to close with a story that really caught me forward .
now there &apos;s a program that some might know .
it &apos;s a game that is called fol@@ ty@@ r .
it was co-@@ developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can use a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to explor@@ ing how the protein is going to evol@@ ve .
now , by the end of its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical exploration .
so far , this was a super@@ computer for super@@ computers .
and this game was played by university profess@@ ors , and now is played .
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that today , the human pattern recogni@@ tion is better the proteins acting than the best super@@ computer .
and when these people came and watched , who &apos;s the best prot@@ ein@@ port mar@@ ker , this was not a co-@@ professor , either no cal@@ tech student , was someone from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who was working on the da@@ wn as assi@@ stant in a re@@ hab@@ iting clin@@ ic , and at night was the best un@@ cy@@ cli@@ d@@ er in the world at the time .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what i have im@@ men@@ se confidence in our future is the fact that we today have more power than individuals to put us on the grand challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponenti@@ al technology .
we have the passion of a di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ators .
we have the capital of tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ es .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to address the new challenges , and to do so that what needs .
we expect a couple of extraordinary decades .
thank you very much .
i think we need to be doing something against a shif@@ ting piece of medical culture .
and i think it begins with a medical medical . and i think that &apos;s what i
and maybe i &apos;m just for a long time in the business , because i can allow myself to give a piece of my own wrong reas@@ on@@ able to do this .
but before i get to the actual top@@ ic of my pres@@ entation , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why don &apos;t we ?
we &apos;re down to the seas@@ on@@ ary , and we &apos;re moving to the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; seem shor@@ tly and turns for statistics and to use a great later team .
so i &apos;m going to engage on a statisti@@ cs that i hope that most of you have heard already before .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we &apos;re talking about one 300 if a bat is 300 .
that means the player is going to hit three out of 10 stro@@ kes .
that means the ball beat into the out@@ field , he falls up , he doesn &apos;t catch , and who has to take the ball trying to throw to the first stage , hasn &apos;t made it in time , and the run@@ ner was safe .
do three out of 10 .
do you know how do you call a 3@@ 00@@ th in serious lea@@ gue baseball ?
so , good , good , maybe an all@@ -@@ star .
do you know how you call a 4@@ 00@@ ter ?
that &apos;s somebody who at the entire end is safe at 10 .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y , as ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y , the last major lea@@ gue baseball player found that during a traditional seas@@ on over 400 times .
let &apos;s trans@@ fer@@ ment to my world of medicine , where i feel more stran@@ k@@ ly , or maybe a little less perhaps with what i talked to about .
if you want to think of a blind twi@@ st , and you &apos;re going to cover into a oper@@ ator that is 400 in the average performance of blin@@ dness .
somehow this doesn &apos;t work , right ?
if you add lives in a particular area , and you have a belo@@ ved people with dea@@ ced heart disease , and their hou@@ se@@ hold over@@ pro@@ ven this to a car@@ di@@ ologist whose head performance is 200 .
but , but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the ris@@ ing bran@@ ch .
and it &apos;ll demo@@ mit a 25@@ 7 .
kind of working doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , should be a cham@@ p@@ -@@ assi@@ stant , a life@@ -@@ assi@@ stant , a life@@ -@@ assi@@ stant ?
now , a thousand , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what a good surge@@ on or doctor or fit@@ m should be .
what we &apos;re doing , however , is that we are all closed to the world , to be perfect to the world with the desire .
never make an er@@ ror , no one does anything but the details of how to do that .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
i was a for@@ gi@@ fied ear@@ ner student .
a fellow in high school , a collea@@ gue , said that brian gold@@ man would learn for a blu@@ eless test .
and it certainly was .
and i learned in my little st@@ ages in the nur@@ sor@@ cher res@@ iden@@ ce at tor@@ onto general hospital , way beyond here .
i learned everything that i memor@@ i@@ zed
in my an@@ atom@@ ical lec@@ ction , i learned the orig@@ ins and the stac@@ ks of every muscle , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ ray that goes away from the a@@ or@@ ta , ob@@ sc@@ ure and ordinary differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ ses .
i even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ sh@@ re a@@ zt .
and all the time i &apos;d colle@@ cted more and more .
and i was good , i was clo@@ sing with c@@ um lau@@ de .
and i left the medical college studying the notion that , if i knew everything and i knew everything , or even as much as possible , as close to full as possible , that i was im@@ it@@ able to doing this .
and it worked for a while until i met a woman &apos;s prin@@ ter .
i resi@@ sted a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto as a woman in tor@@ onto brought to me to the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital .
at that moment i was ap@@ poin@@ ted to car@@ di@@ ological service in car@@ di@@ vi@@ c service .
and it was my head , when the emergen@@ cy workers se@@ arch@@ ed car@@ di@@ ological ad@@ vice to study the emergen@@ cy patients .
and let &apos;s give feedback to my great@@ room .
i looked at my wife &apos;s press , and it was in brea@@ le@@ ation .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she made a gr@@ ant sound .
and when i lost their ch@@ est with the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ op@@ op@@ e , i could hear a sc@@ ra@@ p of sound on both sides , which told me that it had underneath wor@@ ris@@ able sau@@ cers of sau@@ ce@@ able failure
this is a condition in which the heart fa@@ ils , instead of pump@@ ing all the blood further , is stuck a part of the blood in the lung , and it &apos;s gradu@@ ally fil@@ ling , so that &apos;s why the shor@@ ten@@ ity comes .
and it wasn &apos;t a difficult to diagno@@ se diagno@@ sis .
i made her up , and took me to the treatment .
i gave her as@@ bur@@ in . i gave her medicine to take the he@@ as@@ ure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water tab@@ lets , so that they &apos;re sle@@ eping the liquid .
and over a year and a half or two hours , they started to feel better .
i was really good at myself .
and i made my first mistakes ; i sent them home .
actually , i did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my birthday without my birthday .
i didn &apos;t take the audi@@ ences , and i did what i had to have , what a call to my upp@@ er would have been to as@@ s@@ ess it with him , so that he had had a chance to make a better painting .
and he knew that he would have been able to control addi@@ tional information to her .
maybe i did it with a good reason .
maybe i don &apos;t want to be the help of need to be the help .
maybe i wanted to be successful and meaning@@ able to take responsibility that i was doing something , and so i would have the capacity to care for my patients without necessarily having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
which i sent her home , i mis@@ sed a quie@@ t voice in me , who tried to say , &quot; gold@@ man , not a good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it was so much to me so much self-@@ confidence that i asked the nur@@ se , who was running about girl dru@@ cker , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay when you went home ? &quot;
and the nur@@ se thought about it and said in a more iden@@ tical way , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;ll go well . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
so i edi@@ ted the inv@@ e@@ kee@@ pers and an am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce and an am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ce and a res@@ cu@@ e and then brought them home
and i started to work back to work .
the rest of the day , i would have the night , i had this na@@ sty feeling in my sto@@ mach .
but i kept working on it .
and at the end of the day , i met my things , sli@@ pped the hospital , and went to the par@@ king park to go home with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t get .
i went home through the emergen@@ cy department on my way home .
and there was another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se that had seen after woman prin@@ ter , but another three words to me , and those three words fear most of the alp@@ ance physi@@ cians that i know .
other medical people fear that too , but the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical care is particularly special , because we see the patients only so ex@@ ert .
the three words , remember , remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient who she hi@@ red home ? &quot;
asked the nur@@ se &apos;s san@@ se .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular do@@ main .
and so she was back .
she was back and in die .
about one hour after she got home , after i had left home , she collap@@ sed and the family called 9@@ 11 , and the res@@ ur@@ men called them back to the emergen@@ cy station with a blood pressure of 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous sho@@ ck of 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous sho@@ ck .
she har@@ dly brea@@ th@@ ed , and blue tu@@ cks were running .
the emergen@@ cy workers re@@ moved all the str@@ ings .
they gave her blood pressure el@@ se@@ where .
they ta@@ pped them to the tu@@ tor@@ ing machine .
i was sho@@ cked , and i was sho@@ cked to the inner .
and i lived through these roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster , because she came after the slow sur@@ fing at the inten@@ sive care station , and i hop@@ ed she would re@@ cover .
and after two , three days , they realized that they would never be a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ed again .
she didn &apos;t suff@@ er a treat@@ able brain damage .
her family started colle@@ cting .
and over the next eight or nine days , they got to that .
you can go through the day the first day -- woman prin@@ ter , a woman , a mother and a grandmother .
they &apos;re saying that you never forget the names of the extin@@ ction .
and that &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve ever found this myself .
the next few weeks i did , and i first found myself the un@@ healthy sla@@ ll that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not the kind of che@@ ap@@ ame i feel , because i felt alone , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy sh@@ ame , if you give a secret of the best friend &apos;s pri@@ de , even though this one gro@@ ves on a fu@@ zz@@ y , and you get caught and the best friend is pres@@ ented with it , and you we@@ ase my best discussion at the end , when you &apos;re appl@@ ying , you never feel like you &apos;re never going to make a mistake again .
if you &apos;re done rever@@ ber@@ ation , and you never make the mistakes again .
that &apos;s the kind of per@@ pe@@ tual sh@@ ame .
so the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you in the outside sick .
it &apos;s the one who tells you that not what you do not what you did , but you &apos;re bad .
and that &apos;s what i felt .
and it was not because of my star physi@@ z@@ ist , he was very happy .
he spoke with the family , and i &apos;m sure he smo@@ ved the wo@@ ws , and sure that i wouldn &apos;t su@@ ck .
but i asked myself all the questions .
why did i not ask the cur@@ pher@@ ti@@ sts ? why did i send them home ?
and then , my worst moments : how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i have been in medicine ?
slowly , but it was certainly constru@@ cted .
i began to feel better .
and then on a fri@@ pp@@ ing day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds and the sun comes out , and i might say i might feel better again .
and i worried that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ ction , and never re@@ com@@ men@@ ded hel@@ p@@ fully , that the voice could with@@ stand .
and she did it .
and i kept working on it .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergen@@ cy station in a commun@@ al hospital in a commun@@ al hospital , and i intervie@@ wed a 25@@ -year-old man with a sever@@ e pla@@ te .
it was a lot of lost , and i &apos;m in ir@@ on .
he was always showing up here .
i looked in the loo@@ p , and it was a little p@@ ink .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him continu@@ ing .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed on his b@@ ars .
two days later , i came to my next emergen@@ cy service and my body &apos;s wife told me to a talk in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember us ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patient with the patient ? &quot;
and it turns out he &apos;s a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ i infe@@ ction .
he had a poten@@ tially vi@@ dangerous disease called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
you can google that , but it &apos;s not infe@@ ction of the ra@@ x , but the upp@@ er brea@@ thing way to replace the dra@@ wings of brea@@ thing .
and fortunately , he did not die .
he got in@@ tra@@ da@@ ous anti-@@ bo@@ tic@@ a , and she got a few days later .
and i went back through the same tor@@ tor@@ ing of sh@@ ame and self-@@ dou@@ bt , felt pul@@ ling my breath , and went to work to work again and again and again and again .
in an emergen@@ cy layer , i have seen a blind behavior for a blind .
already , a lot of people have heard that you &apos;re working in a hospital , which at that time only got 14 patients a night .
and in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably no de@@ fe@@ ction in their treatment .
and at one point , i thought he had kid@@ ney ro@@ cks .
i mobili@@ zed the x-@@ ray of the kid@@ ney , when that was illegal , my collea@@ gue resul@@ ted in the re@@ view of the patient &apos;s right to the patient &apos;s right and calling the oper@@ ators .
the other one had strong di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
i ren@@ dered flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dra@@ te him , and i asked my colleagues as well to ju@@ dge him .
and that did , and when he recogni@@ zed a soli@@ bility in the bottom sector , he called the oper@@ ators .
they &apos;ve been involved in both cases , and they &apos;ve done well .
both of both cases were na@@ ked by me , ran@@ ging me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was only in the first five years , what many of my colleagues cla@@ im@@ ed , but total non@@ sense .
some of my puzz@@ les were published in the last five years .
it &apos;s alone , hard@@ or@@ ed and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i &apos;m not going to finish with my mistakes and talk about them , if i vote the quie@@ t voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so they don &apos;t step the same thing ?
if i &apos;m keeping into a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when &apos;s the last time you heard of somebody who &apos;s been talking about fal@@ su@@ ity about mis@@ line ?
oh , yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party , and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i were to ask in a room full of colleagues and about their immedi@@ ate support , and i inst@@ all@@ ed them what i just told you , i would probably not achieve the end of the second story , before it would really be aw@@ k@@ ward , somebody would hi@@ re a jo@@ ke , they would switch the top@@ ic and for@@ got the rest .
and in fact , when i or my colleagues know that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c in my hospital had taken away the wrong leg , they &apos;d say i had trouble look at him in the eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally den@@ ial of er@@ r@@ ors .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic posi@@ tions -- the ones that make mistakes and those that don &apos;t make up . those , the people who don &apos;t make the sleep and those with good out@@ comes , with bad results and problems with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological reaction just like anti@@ bodies that attack a human .
and there is the idea that if we are to the people who make mistakes from medicine , we &apos;re holding a sec@@ ure system .
but there are two problems to do this .
in my 20 years of cognitive consciousness and journ@@ alism , i have made a personal medical study on medical mistakes and fal@@ ses , to make all of us for my first article that i make to the tor@@ onto star to my show , to the tor@@ onto star to my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely inevi@@ t@@ less .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day is going to happen every day , where a decade of 10 medi@@ es is either a wrong or wrong , where we get to hospitals infe@@ ctions and continue to be ra@@ va@@ ged or de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing or dead .
in this state , about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans die about 4@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans .
in the united states , the instit@@ utes of medicine calcu@@ late the number at 100,000 .
both of these are strong sub@@ fin@@ ants , because we don &apos;t look as accu@@ rate the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the cru@@ x .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge know all of the two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistakes , so that we can take a perfect disease proce@@ d@@ ure for a patient with breast pain .
and then i take the same patient with fun pain , make it s@@ mil@@ ed and car@@ ried it and cu@@ tter it , and give me a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic breath , and all of a sudden , the story is through con@@ temp@@ t with con@@ temp@@ t .
i &apos;m not taking the same line .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same way .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way .
all of this together are un@@ avo@@ i@@ d@@ able .
so if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught it and provi@@ ding all the failed health profession@@ als , then no one &apos;s left .
and don &apos;t know the dog about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst ancestors ?
in my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black shape . &quot; i have the hab@@ it to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everyone from the res@@ cu@@ e memor@@ ers to the car@@ di@@ ologist , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what &apos;s your control ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show with the micro@@ phone .
and then their pu@@ p@@ ils di@@ p , they stand in front of their head , and then they look down , and they start to tell their stories , and start to tell up to their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i fo@@ unded . &quot;
what they need is an environment that uses it to be able to scale .
what they &apos;re needed is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physi@@ ci@@ zer .
the new determin@@ ed doctor is a human , know about his humanity , accep@@ ts it , not to make pri@@ de of mistakes , but gives everything from them to learn from them so that it can be passed on .
she &apos;s sharing her experience with others .
they &apos;re suppor@@ ting when others are talking about their mistakes .
and she shares other people &apos;s mistakes , not about fla@@ pping , but in a lo@@ vely , working way that everybody &apos;s benef@@ iting .
and she works in a health culture that recogni@@ zes that people fill the system with life , and when that &apos;s , people are also doing mistakes from time to time .
so that the system is developing to create se@@ cu@@ s that make it easier to find mistakes , and it &apos;s also allowed to create wor@@ thy to support suppor@@ tive spaces in which everybody who recogni@@ zes the health , even speak things , can also explain what potential mistakes are plac@@ ed and even re@@ war@@ ded . and this especially for people like me who are making the mistakes and the at@@ tain@@ ment of that re@@ tali@@ ate .
e@@ w : my name is brian gold@@ man .
i &apos;m the new@@ ly defined physi@@ cian .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m wrong . but i &apos;m trying to learn best to come out of it to ad@@ mit it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to do from me , but i can live with it .
so let me conclu@@ de with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , a little idea .
it &apos;s transforma@@ ble under the inner properties .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
you probably know that he was in 18@@ 35 here .
you might think that it &apos;s fri@@ gh@@ ten of fin@@ s , but it &apos;s not true .
basically , he colle@@ cted fish .
he described an enti@@ ty as &quot; common . &quot;
it was a p@@ ie rop@@ e .
up to the &apos; 8@@ 0s , he was fis@@ hed in grand style .
now it &apos;s in the cover of en@@ danger@@ ed species .
we &apos;ve heard this story many times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos , or by other places , it &apos;s not very special .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless we &apos;re still going to the gala@@ pa@@ gos .
we &apos;re still thinking it &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ ily .
the bre@@ ach@@ es still describe it as un@@ tou@@ ched .
what &apos;s going on here ?
the second story is to characteri@@ ze a different concept , the transforma@@ tional ta@@ il@@ ies .
because i experienced a la@@ go@@ on when i studied a la@@ go@@ on in the west in 197@@ 1
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i was going to work in africa .
i thought i could integra@@ te myself .
and i got a horri@@ ble sun@@ fire , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get out of there
it was my first sun@@ be@@ ard .
as you can see , the la@@ go@@ on of pal@@ ms and some man@@ gro@@ ves were rever@@ sed by some man@@ gro@@ ves .
there were tra@@ w@@ ning of about 20 in@@ ches , black ch@@ ie@@ f whit@@ e@@ kee@@ pers , a sub@@ form of the f@@ au@@ mp .
the fis@@ hes of these sta@@ y@@ li@@ es were very productive , and the fis@@ her@@ men were living well of these , and mix@@ ed fis@@ her@@ men in ghana , over@@ average .
when i got back 27 years later , the fish was s@@ hr@@ un@@ k down to half of his size .
they are grown five in@@ ches .
they had been gene@@ tically engine@@ ered .
it was still fis@@ her@@ y .
but the people were still happy .
and the fish also had the fortun@@ e to be still there .
so it hasn &apos;t changed anything , and yet , anything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my occu@@ pa@@ tion in the re@@ plac@@ ing lo@@ ating fis@@ her@@ y in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- even the beginning of the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe was fund@@ ing a lot of developing projects .
fis@@ her@@ ies were foreig@@ ned countries that caught 25@@ ,000 fish , the industrial fis@@ bs this fairly beautiful ship called mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
i went to sleep , and we made diver@@ sa@@ tions all over the south south sea , and especially in the ja@@ vas@@ de@@ e .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i now know that it was the reason of the oceans .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of our college were we@@ ts , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
most of the fish that are the small dots there on the ru@@ b@@ ble , the s@@ mi@@ ffer pi@@ le , were coral re@@ e@@ f fish .
so essentially the bottom of the ocean came back to de@@ ck and was thro@@ wn back .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is getting very fast .
within a year , you &apos;re going to move through and you start with the commercial fish .
the reason becomes changed . so in this case -- a hard reason or a soft cor@@ als is played mu@@ ck coo@@ ks .
this is a dead tur@@ tle .
they were not e@@ aten , they thre@@ w them away because they were dead .
once upon one , we started a rela@@ x .
she wasn &apos;t dro@@ w@@ ning .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of cra@@ ck@@ les is being acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated by fis@@ her@@ men each time when they go in areas that haven &apos;t been flat .
but it &apos;s not going to docum@@ ent .
we &apos;re changing the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we ad@@ just our best values of the new level , and don &apos;t let us remember what was there .
if you gener@@ alize it , what happens is what it happens .
there are some good things on the y-@@ axis : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the green of their land , the water supply .
over time it changes . it changes , because for the people , they are , of course , their actions .
every generation is looking at the images that you take at the beginning of your conscious life as a standard , and it &apos;s going to lead all of it .
the difference is then percei@@ ved as a loss .
but they don &apos;t realize the previous los@@ ses .
it can be a sequence of change .
and eventually they want to get the na@@ sty rema@@ ins of rema@@ ins .
that &apos;s what most of us are now gro@@ unding our goal .
we want to get things that are van@@ ished or things that are not as big as they were .
you might think that the problem that people saw , even when they lived in predat@@ or societies , they killed animals , and who had just been aware of a few generations of what they had done .
because obviously an animal is going to be very common , only before it dies , before it dies .
so you don &apos;t waste a lot of ne@@ ar@@ t-@@ running animals .
you always lose ger@@ m@@ ous animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not true as a big loss .
over time , we &apos;re focused on the big animals , and in the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they &apos;re getting r@@ ar@@ er because we &apos;re harv@@ est@@ ing them .
with time , no fish sta@@ ys left , and we think that &apos;s the personal value .
the question is , why people accept it .
well , because they didn &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , con@@ fir@@ m that it was really different .
you &apos;re going to con@@ fir@@ m it , because the evidence , as you &apos;re facing in an earlier form , are not as you would like to sign the evidence .
there &apos;s , for example , the an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that the report of a billi@@ on in this area , who can &apos;t be used large fish , can &apos;t be used , or by fishing scientists , usually not going to be used because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we are living in hospit@@ alized societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this is demon@@ str@@ ating the enor@@ m@@ ously important role that a marine prote@@ cted area can play .
because of the oce@@ di@@ ons , we &apos;re basically bringing back the past .
we re@@ ar@@ range the past , that people cannot be able to understand , because the core values have changed and very low .
so people can see a marine prote@@ cted area and that can benefit from the insi@@ ght that it en@@ ables them to re@@ store their core values .
what about the people that this cannot be possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the mi@@ d-@@ west , for example ?
here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , and also fill the gap .
this is the ren@@ der@@ ing of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
well , a long time ago there was fra@@ w@@ als -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes and the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts are probably remem@@ ber@@ ing &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people got so tou@@ ched by this -- not just from the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ y story , why were they so stru@@ ck by the image of the ima@@ ging ?
because it &apos;s a little bit in@@ j@@ ury that has lost some lost in some way .
so , my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , the only one i &apos;ll give , is to c@@ amer@@ on , so he roll@@ s &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
thank you very much .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in commun@@ ist 0@@ germany , you had to , if you had a ty@@ bo@@ machine agre@@ ed to the government .
they also had to regi@@ ster a paper with pres@@ cri@@ p@@ t@@ les from this ty@@ ph@@ el .
the reason for this : the government was able to track back , where a text came from .
if they found an article with fal@@ se thought , they could look at the cre@@ ator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west how anyone could do something like this , and how much that stimul@@ ated the re@@ lief choices .
in our own countries , we would never do anything like this .
but if you &apos;re in a new color prin@@ ter of the leading las@@ er prin@@ ter from the leading las@@ er prin@@ ts and prin@@ ting a page , this page bright bla@@ mming bli@@ ps on every page that can clearly send the page to you in a pattern that is clearly able to follow the page on them and track their prin@@ ter .
this is what we &apos;re going to do today .
and nobody doesn &apos;t seem to re@@ tali@@ ate about that .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three major sources of today online problems of the online online problems .
now , let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can cut the attack into categ@@ ory .
we &apos;ve got three main groups .
there are online crimin@@ als .
for example , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ w from k@@ ie@@ w in the u@@ kra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these people deser@@ ve money .
they use online insu@@ sel@@ s to ear@@ n a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several well-@@ known cases of online milli@@ on@@ th , multi@@ 100 on@@ on@@ aries that make their money through attac@@ ks .
this is w@@ la@@ di@@ mir t@@ sa@@ st@@ sin from cam@@ ce in est@@ eland .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ qu@@ z .
ste@@ phen wat@@ son .
b@@ j@@ by@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
these are mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q@@ ar da@@ an@@ and and so on and so forth .
these people are getting online online , but they were provi@@ ding it illegal , such as tro@@ j@@ er used to sound money from our bank account , as we were doing our online ban@@ king , or also key@@ log@@ ger who colle@@ cted our credit card information to the key@@ board , while we pur@@ ch@@ ased over an infe@@ cted computer online .
the american intelligence agen@@ cy was five months ago the s@@ wis@@ s accoun@@ ts of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and in this account were 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars when it was fro@@ zen .
mr. ja@@ in himself is on free foot , the in@@ hab@@ it place is un@@ known .
and i want to argue that it &apos;s more likely today that we &apos;re becoming vic@@ ti@@ ms of a online dis@@ ruption than a fil@@ ling in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that it &apos;s going to get even worse .
in the future , most of the crime are going to be online .
the second biggest conc@@ ern of subje@@ cts that we can obser@@ ve today are not motiv@@ ated by money
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sts about , an opini@@ on , or by their audience .
groups like anony@@ mous are wi@@ ped up over the last 12 months , and they &apos;re one of the main players on the field of online attac@@ ks .
so , these are the three main issues : crimin@@ als that do it for money , fun@@ lo@@ cking activi@@ sts like anony@@ mous that contribu@@ tes resi@@ stance , but the last group are nations , governments that run the attac@@ ks .
because we &apos;re mostly like far@@ in@@ ot@@ ar , we &apos;re talking about ga@@ in@@ ot@@ ar
it shows you amazing what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
reg@@ ine ot@@ ar is a very high-@@ level cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- nam@@ ely . it &apos;s it .
last fall last fall , it had to express in@@ sol@@ um@@ z , because hl@@ in@@ ot@@ es had been ha@@ cked .
somebody was cut in , and he was very ha@@ cked the system .
and last week , in a meeting with the du@@ tch government negoti@@ ation , i hi@@ red one of the more ag@@ gre@@ gation of this group asking if he liked it possible that , because the mer@@ in@@ ot@@ ar ha@@ cks had died .
and his answer was yes , &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die at con@@ sequence of a ha@@ ck like this ?
dig@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate place .
they &apos;re selling cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
what do you do with a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate ?
now a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate requires , if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ p , with all@@ -@@ en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted fo@@ ods , for example , g@@ mail .
now , we &apos;re all using , or many of us , g@@ mail , or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially common in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign hol@@ ders like g@@ mail , because they know that they can trust more than local families , and that they &apos;re en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over the m@@ ell connections , so that the local government can &apos;t kno@@ ck in their conversation in their conversation .
if you can do , if you go into a foreign fan .
cer@@ ti@@ fication of cer@@ ti@@ fication and ger@@ l@@ ord cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of pl@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
what about the arab spring and the things that &apos;s happened in eg@@ y@@ pt , for instance ?
now in eg@@ y@@ pt , the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy in apri@@ l in apri@@ l , 2011 , the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an intelligence police , and they found a lot of ac@@ tors .
in these fil@@ es , a fol@@ der was called &quot; the edi@@ fish . &quot;
and in this case , mus@@ ples were one in germany in germany that sold a few programs that sold the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government with which they -- in a very big frame -- were able to absor@@ b all the communication of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens .
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
the commercial head@@ quar@@ ters quar@@ ter is right here .
so america &apos;s governments are tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with aid tools to help protect their own citizens .
but today , western governments help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago of the so-@@ called &quot; the corpo@@ ration , &quot; which was a tro@@ j@@ an who was used by ger@@ man government offi@@ ci@@ als to sign their own citizens .
if you are sus@@ pi@@ cted in a crimin@@ al accident , pretty much , your phone is stru@@ ck with your phone .
but today , we are far beyond about that .
they &apos;re ap@@ poin@@ ting their internet connection .
they use tools like the state pi@@ j@@ ans to talk to their computer with a tro@@ j@@ an that allows them to monit@@ or their whole communication , listen to their online discus@@ sions , to collect their pas@@ s@@ words .
so , if we keep thinking about these things , the obvious answer of people would be , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a bra@@ ck citi@@ zen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about myself .
i don &apos;t have anything to hi@@ de . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t create any sense .
priv@@ acy has to be given .
priv@@ acy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a choice of priv@@ acy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between free@@ dom@@ s and control .
and as we like today , in 2003 , in our governments , we are affec@@ ted every law that we have success@@ fully con@@ gest@@ ed forever .
and do we trust , trust ourselves any future of every future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions we need to emplo@@ y for the next 50 years .
it might seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ te bri@@ st@@ les .
the first con@@ cre@@ te st@@ ones were produced in 18@@ 6@@ 8 , and caused a simple idea : mod@@ able mod@@ ul@@ es with em@@ ph@@ ement that fit together .
con@@ cre@@ te blocks became very quick the most en@@ danger@@ ed sphere in the world .
they were invi@@ ting us to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , a window at the other .
basically , the con@@ cre@@ te buil@@ der of our time has become the building block of our time .
nearly a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out of this .
it &apos;s called the auto@@ matic commit@@ late stone .
and within a few years , le@@ go moved in every hou@@ se@@ hold .
it &apos;s been esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion ro@@ cks were produced -- or 75 ro@@ cks for each person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings .
now le@@ go could do it for everyone .
le@@ go basically has basically taken the con@@ cre@@ te block , the construction block of the world , and created a building block for our imagination .
in the mean@@ time , in the same year , at the bell lab@@ s , the next revolution was announ@@ ced , the next building block .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic , stre@@ t@@ ched ti@@ cks to a world in which everything was inter@@ active .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allow us to build much larger , more complex circu@@ me , a bri@@ ck after another .
but there is a main difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t personally toler@@ ate that that the building of our time is reser@@ ved for the experts , and so i decided to change it .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of the engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing li@@ tt@@ life &apos;s portra@@ its .
so let me show you how they work .
li@@ tt@@ yle &apos;s cells are electr@@ onic mod@@ ul@@ es that have a specific function .
they &apos;re pre@@ fer@@ red , light , clay , engine and sen@@ sor .
and the best part is that they connect with magne@@ ts together .
that &apos;s not how they can &apos;t put them wrong .
the st@@ ones are liquid co@@ des .
green is er@@ ase , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is op@@ pos@@ ment and organ is c@@ able .
so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green together , and you can build very fast circu@@ me .
they &apos;re provi@@ ding a blue on a green , and you can make light .
they can put a switch in between , and so they create a little di@@ bart .
take the switch out by a pul@@ smo@@ sity , which is here , inst@@ all@@ ed , and you &apos;ve made a little blind .
so if you add this bu@@ zz@@ er for an extra effect , and you make a l@@ inger machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , li@@ tt@@ ue &apos;s actually is quite powerful .
instead of doing code , re@@ wir@@ ing or re@@ pair , li@@ tt@@ inger of its allow them to code with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so to acceler@@ ate the blin@@ k or slow it down , they just throw on this butt@@ on , and it makes the impul@@ se faster or slo@@ wer .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ ue &apos;s its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a us@@ er-@@ hand@@ ed rock .
lights , notes , solar elements , mot@@ ors -- all should be available .
we re@@ duced li@@ tt@@ leb@@ es to kids , and we see playing with it .
and it was an un@@ belie@@ vable experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start the electr@@ on@@ ics that they start to understand in the everyday day , and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like , for example , works a night light , or why the do@@ ors sta@@ ys on the back , or re@@ acting an ipo@@ d like a touch .
we also brought li@@ tt@@ ue &apos;s into design schools .
so , for example , we had computer designers with no experience in electr@@ onic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ yle leaves as a material .
and here we see , with peter , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ the the ...
a few weeks ago , we got li@@ tt@@ ine@@ its to ris@@ d and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just car@@ ton , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what makes them . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ controlled con@@ sor@@ ti@@ a can@@ n@@ on .
but wait , this one is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a bu@@ mer from pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , which has fear in the dar@@ k@@ ness .
for these non-@@ engineer , li@@ tt@@ worth &apos;s mind became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became just another material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone available .
so li@@ tt@@ ord &apos;s open source is li@@ tt@@ thei@@ zed .
you can go to the website , send all the design comm@@ and@@ ments and make them themselves .
we want the world of the educ@@ ators , the inv@@ ent@@ or , to encoura@@ ge compassion , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , is heard us .
so , go away and start to inv@@ ent .
thank you very much .
