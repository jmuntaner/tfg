you know , one of the great fortun@@ ors about travel@@ ing and one of the pleasure in the eth@@ no@@ graph@@ ian research is to live with the people who still remember the old days , and that their past still tou@@ ches them on the rain , ta@@ pping them into the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
and just knowing that ja@@ gu@@ ama &apos;s still travel@@ ing beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the importance of the my@@ th of the el@@ der@@ ly , or the importance of the my@@ th of the el@@ der@@ ly , is the idea that the world that we live in is not in absolute sense , as a con@@ sequence of a group of certain ways that we live in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as that our ancestors have success@@ fully success@@ fully success@@ fully reach@@ ed , and full of a group of certain generations , has been talking about it as well
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ table ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ments .
we all are born . we bring kids to the world .
we &apos;ve been through spec@@ a@@ tional ritu@@ als .
we need to engage with the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy ab@@ und@@ ance of death , and so we shouldn &apos;t be surprised that we all sing , dan@@ cing and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ton@@ o of the lim@@ ption , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the ar@@ rate in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o desert of northern kenya , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the middle of the sahar@@ a , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the middle of the sahar@@ a , or even a y@@ ak@@ -@@ str@@ ater on the pad of the ly@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess of the world , ever@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess of the world .
all these people are teaching us that there are other differences opportunities , other ways of thinking , other ways to ori@@ ent@@ ate around the planet .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , can be ful@@ fil@@ ling with hope .
together , the coun@@ t@@ less cultures in the world will form a network of spi@@ der@@ ful and cultural life , which is re@@ duc@@ ing earth as well as the biological life network that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
and you can think of this cultural life network as an eth@@ no@@ sphere , as the sum of all the thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , inspi@@ ra@@ tions and intui@@ tions , which have been created by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of human@@ kind .
it &apos;s the symbol of everything we are and what we are as ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly know@@ ous species .
and just like the bio@@ sphere had been highly re@@ je@@ cted , this was with the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- it was only even greater speed .
no biolog@@ ist would say , for example , 50 percent or more of all kinds of extin@@ ction are extin@@ ct , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ari@@ o in the field of biological diversity -- bar@@ ely what is known to us is known as the most optimi@@ stic paradig@@ m in the field of cultural diversity .
and the key indi@@ c@@ ator for this is the extin@@ ction of languages .
and when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the earth .
now , language is not just the over@@ head of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary or a series of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ graph@@ s .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means where the sou@@ l of a certain culture can find access to the material world .
every language is like an ol@@ d-@@ held forest of the mind , a turning point , an idea , an ecosystem spi@@ ritual opportunity .
and from those 6@@ ,000 languages today , as we sit here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , they stop wh@@ is@@ st@@ ating half of them in the e@@ ars of children
they &apos;re no longer taught to pay them . that &apos;s when nothing is being done , they &apos;re actually dead already .
what could be lon@@ ely than being re@@ je@@ cted by sil@@ ence to be one of the last people who speak your language , no way to pass the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect the hope to pay on children ?
and yet , of course , this horri@@ ble dest@@ in@@ y actually dis@@ per@@ ses somebody on earth , about two weeks , because every two weeks , an el@@ der@@ ly person dies , and takes the last di@@ vor@@ ce of an old language with itself .
and i know some of you will say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; would the world not a better place , if all of us just speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s get this language yor@@ m@@ ba . let &apos;s leave can@@ ton@@ ese .
let &apos;s be a kog@@ i . &quot;
and then , you &apos;d suddenly see what it would be like if you wouldn &apos;t talk to your own language .
so today , i would like to take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a short trip through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try and make sure that actually lost what &apos;s actually gone .
now , there are some of us who forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; it &apos;s really different
for example , for example , take this child to the bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon , the people of an@@ a@@ kon@@ da believe that they had my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally dro@@ pped from the east in the bel@@ ly of hol@@ y sna@@ kes .
this is a people who don &apos;t develop cogni@@ tively between the colors of blue and green , because the sky that people dep@@ end on are custom@@ i@@ zed by the forest .
they &apos;ve called a strange language and a no@@ is@@ y language called l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ ecu@@ tions : you have to mar@@ ry someone who talks to a different language .
all of this is ro@@ ot@@ ing in the my@@ th@@ ology past , which is similar to these big houses where the team is talked about six or seven languages , but you never hear somebody who &apos;s lear@@ ned to a language .
they &apos;re just listening and they start talking .
or , one of the most intri@@ gu@@ ing tri@@ bes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i in the nor@@ the@@ astern of ecu@@ ad@@ or , is an amazing person that has been cont@@ ac@@ ted for the first time in 195@@ 8 .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ary interven@@ tions were trying to take place and make a very famous mistake .
they b@@ low out sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing photos from the air , which we would as@@ s@@ ert as friend@@ ly gest@@ ures , and so they for@@ got that these people had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their life .
and they took these photographs off the forest floor , trying to see the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and conclu@@ ded that this was a business map of de@@ vil , and killed the five mis@@ sion with the spe@@ ar .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i was killing not just the spe@@ ar with the spe@@ ar .
they lin@@ ed each other through each other .
5@@ 4 percent of the dea@@ ths were happening through dri@@ ll dri@@ ll .
so we went back to the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people to die about it , they would die so old because of his aging , and we killed him with the spe@@ ar .
but at the same time , they had a clear preser@@ vation of fore@@ sts , which was amazing .
their h@@ unter@@ s could smell the ur@@ rier of an animal from 40 steps at a distance and deter@@ mine what was the animal species of this ow@@ ner .
in the early 8@@ 0@@ 0s , i got a really amazing job when i asked my professor at harvard and to in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ate the secret societies that were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ te and the phili@@ ton ma@@ cou@@ tes , and the tox@@ age that was used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es for making z@@ om@@
now to give you a sense of sen@@ sing , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of vo@@ je@@ n and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a cul@@ t of black magic .
in contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ stic view of the world .
well , it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to count the great world repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives , what would you say ?
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism or whatever they do .
a continent will ex@@ ec@@ ute , because the guess was that in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , there was no religious belief in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , of course , there was one and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o of these very profound religious thoughts during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very in australia .
but what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that life@@ -@@ changing relationship between the living and the dead .
the living ser@@ ves the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be was@@ hed from under the big water , answers to the rhyth@@ m of the dance , to en@@ h@@ ance the sou@@ l of the living pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly , so that the ac@@ gent@@ th will be a short moment to god .
i mean , i like to say that vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like , &quot; your white goes to church and talks about god .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become a god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed with you , you &apos;re taken away from your mind . how can you be a har@@ d-@@ be@@ am ?
you see , these amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : ht@@ o@@ do@@ o-@@ ac@@ les in a fix@@ acy state , the blo@@ wing coal of the ability to affect the body so that it feels when it gets into a state of extreme ar@@ ou@@ sal , that it doesn &apos;t occu@@ p@@ y itself in a state of extreme ar@@ ou@@ sal .
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met , the kog@@ i of the si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia , the most extraordinary one .
return of the ancient ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ an civilization , the car@@ bia co@@ ast@@ al layer of col@@ om@@ bia , and in the event of the super@@ ca@@ p , these people wo@@ ke up into an is@@ o@@ o@@ zed vol@@ can@@ ic massive that ris@@ es over the car@@ ib@@ col@@ an level .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed continent , these people were the only ones that were never agre@@ ed from the sp@@ ani@@ ards .
up to this day , you &apos;re gover@@ ned by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , but the p@@ es@@ ster@@ ship is an extraordinary part .
the young ac@@ qu@@ is@@ es are taken at the age of three and four years old from their families and taken two years from the gl@@ aci@@ er of the gl@@ aci@@ er of the gl@@ aci@@ er for 18 years , and two years from the gl@@ aci@@ er of the gl@@ aci@@ er of the gl@@ aci@@ er , which is now me@@ tam@@ or@@ de@@ cally , they &apos;re now going to grow me@@ tam@@ or@@ de@@ cally in the la@@ p of the great mother .
and throughout that entire time , they &apos;re going to introdu@@ ce cul@@ tur@@ ally into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain the cla@@ im that their pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers , the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we could say that e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- balance will hold hold of balance .
at the end of this amazing phase , one day , one day , one day , at age 18 , is going to be a sun@@ light , and in this most cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of consciousness , when the sun starts to be con@@ fin@@ ed to the ra@@ ys of the amazing beautiful landscape , and the p@@ rie@@ sts come back and says , &quot; look ? it &apos;s really the way i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call themselves the older brothers , and they say that we are the yo@@ unger brothers , they &apos;re responsible for destruction of the world .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
so whenever we think about na@@ tive and landscap@@ es , we either com@@ pla@@ in either r@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old ru@@ sto@@ d of the no@@ ble wild , which is a fin@@ ite thought , or other th@@ ore@@ au , and say , these people are connected more with nature than we are .
so , na@@ tives aren &apos;t sen@@ ti@@ mental , they &apos;re not going to be s@@ mil@@ ing by the no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
there isn &apos;t a lot of room for that in the malaria vac@@ ated s@@ m@@ at or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but it &apos;s sha@@ ped by time and ritual , but it &apos;s sha@@ king a myster@@ i@@ ous ni@@ m@@ bus of ti@@ bet , which is not based on the earth , because it &apos;s brea@@ th@@ ed into the human consciousness , because it &apos;s brea@@ th@@ ed into the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child comes to the belief that &apos;s grown in the belief that the mountain is an a@@ x@@ -@@ spirit , and there &apos;s another relationship with that resource or this place , as a little child from mon@@ tan@@ a , who is growing in belie@@ ving a mountain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ cks that can be passed off .
whether it &apos;s a pi@@ de of a mind or a pi@@ le , it &apos;s ir@@ relevant .
now , what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of tou@@ ch col@@ om@@ bia , and i believed that these fore@@ sts were there to get rid of .
this led to another person when my friends were am@@ on@@ gst the k@@ wa@@ ki@@ u@@ l , who believe that these fore@@ sts are the emerging place of hu@@ cu@@ k and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ic spirit that lives on the nor@@ ti@@ des of the world , comm@@ ands that they would be doing on their ha@@ mat@@ sa@@ chs earlier .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of your extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . that &apos;s why there &apos;s a plant here .
this is a photograph i took to the last apri@@ l in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , who many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active design from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of sha@@ man .
what &apos;s amazing about mo@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca is not just the pharma@@ col@@ o@@ gical potential of this pre@@ par@@ ity , but it &apos;s about process@@ ing , it &apos;s about two different sources of be@@ ta@@ k@@ an@@ ines , har@@ m@@ in , har@@ mo@@ lin , easily hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen . it &apos;s like , har@@ m@@ in , it &apos;s like a coffee ch@@ ase of the coffee plants with the name of the co@@ ffe@@ e@@ a of the coffee plant called the psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
this plant con@@ tains some very powerful ter@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins that have a ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ gressi@@ la@@ cycle tam@@ in , five and mathema@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ cell@@ in , lincol@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in , in a very similar way .
if you &apos;ve seen the y@@ an@@ o@@ mom@@ i , how they capture this stuff , this sub@@ stance that they con@@ tain from different species also inclu@@ des certain x@@ y@@ di@@ cs of alp@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in .
so , mu@@ cking that po@@ w@@ der is something like being shot out of a gun of gun , like b@@ aro@@ te pain@@ ts and land@@ ing on top of a sea of electricity .
there will not be a di@@ stor@@ tion of reality , but the resol@@ ution of reality .
i even did my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ t , the man who introduced the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c est@@ re@@ a with the discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in the 3@@ 0@@ 0s , discus@@ sed it . i said you could not be there as hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen , you &apos;re not there to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ birds is they &apos;re not going to be smart , because by one in the human gut gut , there &apos;s an enzy@@ me called mon@@ o@@ am@@ in-@@ o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase , den@@ at@@ u@@ ri@@ cally .
they can only be used with some other chemicals that are ma@@ o den@@ atur@@ ing the ma@@ o den@@ at@@ u@@ ri@@
now , the intri@@ gu@@ ing thing is that the be@@ ta@@ co@@ dden that con@@ tain in the li@@ v@@ as are ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of exactly the way that they need to solve tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins . ask themselves yourself .
how can these people from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ v@@ ance plants that can find those two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally rather than combin@@ ed , creating a kind of bio@@ chemical version , so that the whole larger than the sum of its parts is the sum of its parts ?
we use this fab@@ ul@@ ous eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , trial and er@@ r@@ ors , which is in@@ signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce .
but if you ask the indi@@ ans , they will say , &quot; the plant spea@@ ks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
so this tri@@ be , the co@@ vering , have 17 vari@@ ations of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , who recogni@@ zes all of you at a large distance in the forest that will appear for our eyes as a way .
and then , you ask them how to do their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand about plants .
i mean , do you know anything at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out that you take each of the 17 vari@@ ants at full mond , and you sing them in a different piece of str@@ um .
now , this does not get you a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than a tri@@ ban to count .
now , the problem is that even those of us who have the sym@@ pa@@ thetic , the idea that you look at as being or@@ g@@ ine and color@@ ous , but you kind of get rid of the past as the real world , which is our world , pro@@ gressi@@ vely forward .
so , the fact is , you know , the 20th century , 300 years , not remem@@ ber@@ ed for his wars or technologi@@ cal innova@@ tions , but rather as an era where we either have been acc@@ ac@@ ed , and the massive destruction of biological diversity on earth either suppor@@ ted or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted . so , the problem is not change .
all cultures have been involved in dance in a new way of life .
and the problem isn &apos;t the technology itself itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans didn &apos;t stop to be less at si@@ ou@@ x than they were se@@ ed and ch@@ ie@@ f tas@@ ks than americans stopped when they &apos;re sitting in horse and ro@@ de@@ to@@ ys .
not change and technology thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed the integri@@ ty of the race no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . ug@@ ly face of the king@@ ness .
and wher@@ ever you look around the world , you &apos;ll find that these cultures were not covered the dec@@ line , and these are dynamic de@@ gra@@ dation in sou@@ the@@ wa@@ k , which seems to be lin@@ ed in the south china ocean , or in a no@@ ma@@ gu@@ k that seems to be brought down in the south china ocean , or the no@@ ma@@ gu@@ k , a population that seems to be brought down in the south china , or as a result of the y@@ an@@ o@@ mom@@ i , where there are perfe@@ c@@ tors that have been f@@ ed during the gold rus@@ h of the gold , where there are perfe@@ c@@ tors that have been car@@ ved during the gold rus@@ h .
or , if we go to the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m recently , you will see the ug@@ ly face of the political domin@@ ance of the political domin@@ ance .
you know , the geno@@ cide , the physical extin@@ ction of people , is lar@@ gely con@@ den@@ sed , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ d , the destruction of people &apos;s lives , is not just jud@@ gment , but lar@@ gely , and multiple levels as a bit of development .
and you can &apos;t understand the stance of suffering if you haven &apos;t experienced it at an under@@ ground level .
i was travel@@ ing with a young collea@@ gue of 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ has@@ du , and i was seeing the face behind sou@@ the@@ sten ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a , and i saw the face behind the statistics of whom you were hearing , 6@@ ,000 million people , who were being killed during the world &apos;s cultural revolution .
the father of this young man was identi@@ fied as his follo@@ wers of the pan@@ ie follo@@ a .
that meant that during the chinese invasi@@ on , it was immediately re@@ turned .
his un@@ cle fle@@ w in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a with her hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , which people brought into ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was as@@ ham@@ ed as pun@@ ish@@ ment for -- being for the crime being weal@@ thy .
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed to prison at the age of two years to hi@@ de himself under her rock@@ ar@@ l , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister that was per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ating this bra@@ p@@ conduc@@ ted act was brought into an edu@@ cational camp .
and one day , she jo@@ ined them out of a l@@ um@@ p@@ y of ma@@ os , and for that inci@@ dence she had to do a heavy labor camp for seven years .
the suffering can be in@@ er@@ ti@@ ous , but the rema@@ ining spirit of the people is something un@@ for@@ ge@@ tt@@ able .
and in the end , we really stand out of an ele@@ ction -- do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ matic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony , or in a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the big anthropo@@ log@@ ine said before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that we would see the entire band@@ wid@@ th of human imagination , but that we were going to wake up a dream one day , and we for@@ got that there were other possibilities of a dream , and for@@ gotten that there were other possibilities .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to think that our species may have been there since 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment the cul@@ t of the clo@@ th@@ es , filled with the reci@@ pe of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od and hier@@ arch@@ y of speci@@ alization and over@@ eff@@ or@@ ts was created -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
now , this super@@ ficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all of the answers to the challenges we face in the en@@ su@@ ing mil@@ len@@ nia .
when we ask these vast cultures to the meaning of human minds , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to re@@ discover the possibility of what we are : people with people who are aware of the importance that all humans and gar@@ dens have to be able to be able to pro@@ sper@@ alize a space , and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
here &apos;s a photograph i took to the n@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands when i went with in@@ u@@ its to the nar@@ af@@ al h@@ unt , and this man , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always dro@@ pped up very well with the in@@ u@@ it , and during the 50@@ ic years , they were forced to pull out , to pull out in sett@@ le@@ ments .
the grand@@ father of this old man &apos;s grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used .
the family , the fear of his life , all of them took him all the g@@ uns and all the tools .
now you &apos;ve got to know that the in@@ u@@ it is not afraid to have the cold , they used it to their advantage .
the gli@@ b@@ les of their sk@@ inn@@ y were origin@@ ally made out of fish being car@@ ved in carto@@ on skin .
her grand@@ father &apos;s grand@@ father didn &apos;t fear himself before the arc@@ tic night or the ris@@ ing stor@@ m .
he would take outside , put his pants out of se@@ ats down and down in his hand , and as the fe@@ ces started to free@@ ze , he formed it in the form of a kni@@ fe .
he spra@@ yed stor@@ ms on the sides of the sp@@ nee of the sp@@ nee , and when it was fully fro@@ zen , he was ama@@ zing a dog dog with it .
he took the dog and impro@@ ved a pla@@ te , took the skelet@@ on and impro@@ v@@ ise a big dog and sc@@ roll@@ ed up a big dog and sc@@ roll@@ ed over the ic@@ es with the sp@@ b kni@@ fe on the g@@ mu@@ m@@ b kni@@ p .
so you can do something like that .
and this , in many ways , is a symbol of the in@@ u@@ it resi@@ stance of the in@@ u@@ it and all the na@@ tive in the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government gave the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l , 199@@ 9 , the complete control of an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas combin@@ ed .
it &apos;s our new hom@@ eland country , and it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ strong .
it &apos;s an independent area . you &apos;re all controll@@ ing together all together .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can look for res@@ cu@@ e with his resi@@ dents , can look and reach
and finally , i think it &apos;s kind of obvious , at least for those of us who have travel@@ ed to these dist@@ ant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all .
they &apos;re the heal@@ ing countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that come back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children will be part of these children , like the dreams of our own children , part of the geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope .
what we &apos;ve been trying to do at national geographic is that we think politicians will never do anything .
we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we think that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cally is not terri@@ fying , but we believe that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for story@@ telling in the world ; our website get 35 million spi@@ des every month .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ six countries are sending our tv chan@@ nel .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions .
and we &apos;re enter@@ ing a series of travel into the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we take our audi@@ ences to places from such cultural wonder@@ s , that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural micro@@ log@@ y , that this world deser@@ ves to exist in many ways that the wisdom of all humans can contribu@@ te to our common well-@@ being .
thank you very much .
what i &apos;m first going to show you as quickly as i can show you is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;ve passed on microsoft , as part of a spectrum , which is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s a environment where they either can be lo@@ cally lo@@ cated , or re@@ gar@@ ded with huge amo@@ unts of visual data .
we see lots of , lots of gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photographs here , which you &apos;re se@@ mi@@ less and continu@@ ing while you can , in any ways , can re@@ ar@@ range , in any ways .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we can look at how large these colle@@ ctions are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital sc@@ or@@ es of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of library , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ es .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can capture the power of a system like this is the amount of pi@@ x@@ els on their screen every single moment , and it also has a very flexi@@ ble architecture .
and this is a whole book , an example of non-@@ data data .
this is b@@ lea@@ k &apos;s house from di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ h is a chap@@ ter .
so to prove that it &apos;s really about a text , and it &apos;s not about an image , we can actually do something like this , to actually show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the text , and it &apos;s no picture .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
this is a reali@@ stic case . this is an ex@@ ca@@ v@@ ation from the guar@@ di@@ an .
every large image is the beginning of a se@@ min@@ a@@ cular line .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real paper out@@ put of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a toll of multiple sc@@ ales .
we also did something on the corner of this particular dic@@ ty on the guar@@ di@@ an .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong announ@@ c@@ ement with very high dete@@ ction , which is much higher than a normal ad , and we ad@@ ded addi@@ tional content .
if you want to look at the fun@@ ctions of this cars , you can see here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ als .
and that &apos;s really reach@@ ing these ideas to be able to dis@@ crimin@@ ate these con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts to the available place on the screen .
and we hope that this is not a po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other non@@ sense anymore -- it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
and , of course , the ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious appli@@ cations for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say we &apos;re going to be contribu@@ ting to this area as well .
but these are all the streets in the u.@@ s@@ .@@ a .
in addition to inst@@ all , at the top , on top of nasa &apos;s sur@@ v@@ ei@@ sive picture .
now , let &apos;s get a little different out .
now , this is actually live on the internet . you can check it out .
so this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really conne@@ cts two different technologies .
one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which from no@@ ah planes , a university student university of college , under the coun@@ sel@@ ing of steve ple@@ tz at u@@ w .
and ri@@ ck s@@ w@@ li@@ sk@@ i was done by microsoft research . it was very good collaboration .
so , this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
and you can see that when we create this kind of thinking where we can inter@@ f@@ ere with images and make that experience of multiple feedback .
but the spa@@ tial order of images in this picture is actually signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce .
and the computer visi@@ on-@@ adop@@ ting algorith@@ ms stuck together with the real space , where these recor@@ dings that were all done near the gras@@ s@@ i of the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies , shows elements of stabili@@ zed di@@ as , or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things were all related to each other in propor@@ tion .
now , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve been showing you other environments .
there are those who are much more econom@@ i@@ zed .
i &apos;d like to show one of the original data sets of no@@ ah , and this is from a early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first worked in summer to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch@@ line behind this technology that &apos;s , and this isn &apos;t necessarily as obvious as you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and all the time .
this is a re@@ construction of ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral not@@ re , who has made it throughout the computer with images of fli@@ ck@@ r , and they &apos;re going to get the not@@ re d@@ ame in fli@@ ck@@ r , and they will recei@@ ve pictures of men in t-@@ shir@@ ts and on the university train , and then each of those orange lim@@ bs represents a picture that was dete@@ cted to this model .
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ y pain@@ t@@ ings , and they all conver@@ ge in relation to each other in relation to each other .
and we can navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
l@@ o : you know , i never believed that i was going to work at microsoft .
so , i &apos;m so gr@@ ate@@ ful for the idea here .
i sus@@ pe@@ ct you can see that there are lots of different types of c@@ ameras : everything from the mobile camera to professional sl@@ ans , a very large number of them , all of them blo@@ wn up in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones .
most of them are inter@@ connected by faces and so many of them .
so , somewhere here are a number of photographs -- there they are .
this is actually a poster by not@@ re d@@ ame , who was really recor@@ ded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things about social growth now , and we are now colle@@ cting data from all of the collective memory of how , visu@@ ally the earth looks -- and everything will be inter@@ connected .
all of these pictures are going to inter@@ connect , and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts .
they &apos;re going to get a model that comes from all over the earth .
consider this as the ad@@ verse work of ste@@ phen law@@ l@@ er on virtual earth .
and this is something that is caused by the complexity that people use , and its use for the user will get bigger and bigger and bigger .
their own photos are being ma@@ pped with tremendous data that has given another person to do .
if someone has made the trouble and then docum@@ ented all those sac@@ ries and share all those sac@@ ries and share them as a starting point to enter into this space , and i can use it as a starting point to go into this space , to use the photos of other people , and to create a kind of repres@@ ent@@ ative model of social experience with the use of other devices .
and of course , the side product of all of these are the very powerful virtual models of each kind of earth that &apos;s not just inter@@ rup@@ ting or satelli@@ te pictures and so forth , but by collective memory and so forth .
thank you very much .
can i get you right ? your software allows you that at a certain point , in the next few years , all of the images that can be used by somebody in the world are fundament@@ ally inter@@ rup@@ ted ?
yeah . she doesn &apos;t do anything other than discover .
if you want to make it hyper@@ -@@ links between the images .
and she does this based on the content in the sli@@ des .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the bra@@ ot@@ al information bra@@ cking information that many of these images have .
so , as if you &apos;re going to take a web@@ search for images , where you put in sent@@ ences , and the text of the website con@@ tains a lot of information about what a picture it is .
but what about the time that image conne@@ cts you to all the images ?
and then the scop@@ e of the se@@ man@@ tic ro@@ pp@@ y and the pul@@ ses that emer@@ ge out of it is really , really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network of network .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . it &apos;s con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
thank you very much indeed .
so i &apos;m going to tell you a few things from my book , which i hope are in harmon@@ y with other things that you &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to make myself a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i want to start by starting what i call &quot; offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
what is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the offi@@ cial belie@@ vement of all western industri@@ alized societies .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma works this way : if our goal is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our citizens , through all of this , through ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the freedom of the individual .
and the reason for that is that liber@@ ty is good in itself , valuable , meaning@@ ful , an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented desire for human beings .
when people have liber@@ ty , each of us will account for themselves to do things that may ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our greater sense , and no one has no way to decide for us .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@
the more choices that people have , the more freedom you have , and the more freedom you have , the more common you have .
so this is , i think , deep in our water supply , that it &apos;s no way that you would be in the sense of questi@@ oning it .
and it &apos;s ro@@ ot@@ ed deep in our own life .
so , i &apos;m going to give you a few examples of what &apos;s allo@@ wing us to modern progress .
this is my super@@ market . it &apos;s not a big one .
i just want to say a little bit about sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
there are 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ ses in my super@@ market , if they don &apos;t count the 10 different extra o@@ vi@@ o@@ o@@ ves and make 12 bal@@ sc@@ au@@ d@@ di@@ des that they could make a huge amount of extra ra@@ ys , in which the un@@ likely case is right , that none of the 17@@ 5 in the store is right for them .
so this is what the super@@ market is .
and then they go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics to put together a stere@@ o -- lou@@ d@@ speak@@ ers , c@@ d players , a c@@ up player , radio , em@@ powered , and in this one electr@@ on@@ ics , there &apos;s so many stere@@ o in this one .
we can put 6@@ .@@ 5 million different radio asse@@ ts together from the components that are being off@@ ered in this business .
you &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that this is a big sele@@ ction .
in other areas -- the world of communic@@ ations .
there was a time when i was a boy , then you could have any tele@@ phone provi@@ ders that you wanted when he came from ma bell .
they &apos;ve r@@ ented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
so a con@@ sequence of that was that the tele@@ phone was never broken .
these days have been over .
we have now almost an infin@@ ite choice of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
and these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- stor@@ 3 fen@@ er@@ - , nas@@ -@@ ha@@ ir@@ -@@ b@@ ust and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ ass l@@ lo@@ ws .
and if you don &apos;t have seen it yet in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to be going to be soon .
and what it does is it causes people to walk into business and ask them to question that question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspe@@ cts of life , which is much more significant than buying objects , the same explosion is the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to a doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they &apos;ll go to the doctor , and the doctor tells them , we could do a a or we could make b .
a has all these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and you say , &quot; do@@ c , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b of these advan@@ tages and risks .
what do they want you to do ?
and if you say , &quot; well , if you &apos;re me , do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i am not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a doctor &apos;s bur@@ den of responsibility for somebody who knows nothing and is ris@@ fully ill , and that &apos;s why there &apos;s not a decision to make a choice -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing marketing for people like you and me , and me , that , if you think about it , you don &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they adverti@@ se around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , they expect us to call up the doctor the next morning and ask for a change of the pres@@ cri@@ ption .
something so profound like our identity is now a question of choice to show how this slide is supposed to be .
we don &apos;t inv@@ ent identity , we inv@@ ent it .
and we tend to re-@@ ada@@ pt ourselves as often as we do .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everybody had one , and they were very quick as quickly as they could , and then they could get kids as quickly as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they were doing after that .
today , everything has been easy to have .
i teach some wonderful intelligent student , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s being bus@@ y because they &apos;re enga@@ ged with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i he@@ al or not ? should i mar@@ ry ? &quot;
should i mar@@ ry later ? should i have children , or should i have a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all un@@ related questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions about whether it means to make all the jobs that i &apos;m making you and don &apos;t get a good note in my class .
and , in fact , they should . these are important questions to question questions .
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed about car@@ l , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day of every room on the planet , except for the la@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , i &apos;m not going to tell you where the wir@@ eless works works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you about that because i want to use it .
so what it means to make this incredible freedom of choice we &apos;ve got to make in terms of work , again and again , whether we should work or shouldn &apos;t work .
we can play our kids playing soc@@ cer , and we &apos;ve got our cell phone on top of one hi@@ p , and our gir@@ ber@@ ry on other hi@@ ps , and our laptop will probably be on our la@@ p .
and even though they &apos;re all shu@@ t off , every minute in which we twi@@ mu@@ late our child in a foot@@ ball game , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; should i embra@@ ce that call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it will definitely be your health &apos;s experience of your child &apos;s foot@@ ball &apos;s experience of a very different
anywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifest@@ yle , life is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in like this was something like this .
that &apos;s what i want to say , there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re looking at now is this way .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
and the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
so we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about it in it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
and one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that he should be able to li@@ ft out of his life .
with so many op@@ tions that you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
and i &apos;m going to give you another dra@@ matic example , a study of invest@@ ments in volunte@@ ers of aging .
a collea@@ gue of mine had access to investment recor@@ ds of van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic f@@ on@@ ce society of about a million contribu@@ tors and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 instal@@ ment@@ ation fund that was introduced to the emplo@@ yer of emplo@@ y@@ ment , accep@@ ted by two percent .
they provide 50 investment fund -- ten percent less users will be part of it as if they were only in five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment of investment that are so hard to decide , it &apos;s so hard to decide that they &apos;re pus@@ hing it to tomorrow .
and then morning , and then morning , and morning , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never
understand that this is not only meant people who have to eat dog food when they go to reti@@ re@@ ment because they don &apos;t put enough money to put back , it also means that they pass great investment services to their emplo@@ yer .
they don &apos;t give them to 5,000 mi@@ es per year on the wor@@ ker who had been happy from ent@@ r@@ ating their contribu@@ tions to their contribu@@ tion .
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence of lots of choices .
and i think it will make the world look like this .
you really want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s all the last time it &apos;s all the last .
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong corpo@@ rate fund , or they don &apos;t want the wrong sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end up less satis@@ fied with the out@@ come of choices than if we had the possibility to decide from a few possibilities from the problem .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is isol@@ ated by the large sele@@ ction of different sal@@ at@@ an@@ ces , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what happens is that sal@@ at@@ d@@ res@@ sing is already perfect -- and what happens is that , you know , this is a simple thing to re@@ gre@@ t , and that re@@ gre@@ t seems to be negative to happiness that they had made their choices , even when it was a good decision .
the more possibilities there is , the easier it &apos;s not to ad@@ gre@@ gate at all , it &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting to the ele@@ ction that they make .
second , what econom@@ ists call op@@ per@@ a-@@ repu@@ t@@ costs .
dan gil@@ bert made a major point of this morning by telling how much of the species we valu@@ ed depen@@ ded on depen@@ ding on what we compare it .
well , if there &apos;s pl@@ ent@@ y of alterna@@ tives to concern@@ s , it &apos;s easy to imagine attra@@ ctive properties of alterna@@ tives that you ex@@ clu@@ de , that makes them less satis@@ fied with the alterna@@ tives you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what they ought to have to think .
so here &apos;s a couple of them on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
very expensive im@@ pa@@ der@@ ers .
beautiful beach . great day . you &apos;ve all got it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; dar@@ n , &quot; the guy thinks , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
everybody in my room neighborhood is gone .
i could park my house right in front of my home . &quot;
and he tra@@ des two weeks from the thought that he &apos;s ab@@ and@@ oned for , day after day , having a great par@@ king place .
op@@ per@@ si@@ fer cost sen@@ ses happiness that we can preser@@ ve through our choices even when what we cho@@ se is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are to the ex@@ pos@@ ure , the more attra@@ ctive fe@@ atures of these choices are lin@@ ed into the op@@ per@@ ari@@ cal cost .
now , here &apos;s another example .
now , this carto@@ on makes some stat@@ ements .
it makes a stat@@ ement about it now , and maybe to do things starting to do so quickly .
but one more important thing that he does is , always who you choose for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and those other things may have many attra@@ ctive properties , and it &apos;s going to become what they will do less attra@@ ctive .
three : es@@ cal@@ ation of expec@@ tation .
this is what hit me when i was trying to exchange my je@@ ans .
i &apos;m fe@@ eding je@@ ans , almost all the time .
and there was a time when there was only je@@ ans of a species , and they bought them , and they were deli@@ vered , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if they were carrying enough enough , they started feeling &quot; okay . &quot;
so , i went to buy new je@@ ans after many years of staf@@ f , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sal@@ es@@ man said , &quot; do you want to s@@ ne@@ ak , easily , or quanti@@ ty ?
do you want to was@@ h butt@@ ons or ti@@ zz@@ ers ? sentence or ac@@ id ?
do you want to have je@@ ans with holes ?
would you like to cut it down , coo@@ ge@@ y , bla@@ h bla@@ h bla@@ h ... &quot; and so on .
and my ja@@ w was down , and after i re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i would love to have the species that once was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what it was , so i spent an hour to try all of these dam@@ n je@@ ans and thro@@ wn out the business -- and i say the truth -- with the fa@@ ke of je@@ ans i &apos;ve ever had .
i got it better . all this choice allowed me to get it better .
but i felt a bad feeling .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt was bad , with all of these available opportunities , my expec@@ tations for what a good few ye@@ ans was going up .
i had very low expec@@ tations . i didn &apos;t have any any expec@@ tation of any kind of expec@@ tations than it was in one form .
as they came , fu@@ g@@ ated in 100 species , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i sett@@ ned what i was expe@@ cting to , and what i had been dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison with what i was expe@@ cting .
raising possibilities in people &apos;s lives will inevi@@ t@@ ably expec@@ tations the expec@@ tations that people have are going to be about how well they &apos;re going to be .
and that leads to much less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because , if they would , they all don &apos;t know what it was about .
and the truth is more like this .
and the reason is , it used to be better than anything worse than anything that was worse , it was possible for people to be able to experience experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
no@@ wa@@ days , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re very weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction -- the best thing you can hope to hope is as good as you are expe@@ cting you to .
they &apos;ll never be surprised . because their expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , are high high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all come from -- the myster@@ y of happiness are low expec@@ tations .
so , i want to say -- a short auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ cal moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really , really , really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done any better . i didn &apos;t ab@@ and@@ on me .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
so , finally , a con@@ sequence of buying a no@@ sting list of je@@ ans , if there &apos;s one way to buy , is that if you &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who is responsible , the world is responsible . what could they do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans are available , and they buy one that &apos;s dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is , it &apos;s so clear .
they could have been able to do it better .
with 100 different kinds of je@@ ans on the re@@ vie@@ ws , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for er@@ r@@ ors .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about it , they acc@@ use themselves .
clinical fun@@ sions explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think the significant -- not the only one , but a significant contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have experienced the dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment of depression , and then when you have to explain these experiences , they think it would be their fau@@ lt .
and so the paradig@@ m of the code is that it makes us feel better , obje@@ ctive , and we feel bad .
so , let me re@@ mind you .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , which is one that we &apos;re all all passionate for , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that a choice is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow any choice that &apos;s better choices than a choice .
there &apos;s a ma@@ gical pi@@ le . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we mis@@ sed this do@@ t for a long time in which we have a common benefit to choice .
now , as a final question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a final question , the thing about thinking about thinking : what all of these choices en@@ ables all of these choices in the industri@@ alized societies , is the material .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard a lot of them whose problem is not that big sele@@ ction .
your problem is that you have too little .
so , the things i &apos;m talking about are a weird problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating and an@@ xi@@ ous : steve le@@ vi@@ tt told you yesterday about how those expensive and hard to help car se@@ ats wouldn &apos;t help , and it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they &apos;re actually doing it .
she &apos;s going to make it worse for us to stand
for example , if anything of what people actually en@@ ables our society to make decisions to the societies in which people have gone to little choice , not just impro@@ ved people &apos;s lives , it would not just improve people &apos;s lives , but it would also be impro@@ ved .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ alle@@ to impro@@ vement of out@@ put .
local international distribution will make it all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big sele@@ ction is pla@@ in to us .
finally , just read this carto@@ on , and , you know , a buil@@ d-@@ up person , says , &quot; ah ! what knows this fish ?
you know , there &apos;s nothing in this gold fish glass . &quot;
pun@@ ish@@ ments of imagination , a very short view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
so the more i thought about it , the more i saw it , the more i saw the fish a bit .
because the truth is that , if you break the gold fish glass so you can do it , you don &apos;t have any freedom . you have paraly@@ sis .
if you break the gold fish glass so everything is possible , you re@@ fer happiness to happiness .
and they increase the paraly@@ sis and the nur@@ turing satis@@ fac@@ tion .
each one takes a gold fish glass .
this is almost limited to limited -- possibly for the fish , for sure , for us .
but the des@@ sh@@ ots are a reci@@ pe of a metaph@@ or@@ ical fish glass is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i guess , cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
thank you very much indeed .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome , and what that might mean , and the discovery of a new group of genes .
and in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we have di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get to the digital code into a new phase of biology by design and building new life .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask some significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think a lot of bi@@ ologists have tried to understand and that &apos;s at different levels .
we &apos;ve tried several ways to simpli@@ fy it to the minim@@ um compon@@ ent compon@@ ent
we &apos;ve almost di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed 20 years . when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , changing the shift from the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now , let &apos;s try to ask whether we can re@@ generate life , or whether we can make new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma gei@@ ma@@ ium , which can repli@@ cate the small@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate themselves in the lab , and we tried to do whether we can do it to a smaller genome .
we managed to get it down to about a hundred genes of the 500 or something that we have here .
but if we look at this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map that &apos;s very simple , compared to ours , trust me , it &apos;s simple , but if we look at all of these genes that we can elimin@@ ate one after another , it &apos;s extremely un@@ likely that it would be a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some is that this chromo@@ some allows us to vari@@ ate the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started asking the question , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
is it en@@ ab@@ ling the chemistry to create these really large molecules that never has been done before ?
and if we can do that , then we can start to start the chromo@@ some ?
a chromo@@ some is equivalent to just a piece of in@@ formed chemical material .
our steps at the di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed of life were exponenti@@ al .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , and our final point would now be able to put on an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
and we started with it 15 years ago .
in fact , it took a few years to start with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
and as it turns out , dna syn@@ thetic is extremely difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world making small parts of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s an in@@ gener@@ ative process , so the longer you make a piece of er@@ ror , the more mistakes you make .
so we had to develop a new method that we could make these little pieces together and cor@@ rect the er@@ r@@ ors .
and this was our first trial , starting with the digital information , the genom@@ e of ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
we created small pieces , we made er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
and the exciting line came when we took this piece of in@@ anima@@ te chemical and put it into a bacteri@@ um , and the bacteri@@ um started to read the genetic code and made vi@@ ral particles .
the vi@@ ral particles were then rele@@ ased by the cells and came back and killed e@@ . col@@ i .
i was talking to the oil industry recently , and they said they felt this kind of model .
you laugh@@ ed more than you did here .
and so we think that this is a situation in the software , actually , in the software , can actually build their hard@@ ware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build an entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters genetic code , and that &apos;s how we thought we could repli@@ cate it from the size of the virus to understand what the individual compon@@ ent compon@@ ent of a living cell is .
design is the key , and if you start with digital information in the computer , this digital information must be really er@@ r@@ ol@@ ed .
when we sequen@@ ced the genome first in 199@@ 5 , the er@@ ror of a 10,000 base pa@@ irs was at a mistake per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
we found 30 mistakes in res@@ cu@@ e . if we had to use the original sequence , it would never be possible to get up .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and they have to over@@ load that with other 5@@ 0-@@ letter st@@ ones to build smaller sub@@ stances so that they can fit .
we &apos;ve put unique elements in here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve put on top of the water@@ mar@@ ks .
think about it : we &apos;ve got a 4@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of these letters -- these letters de@@ als about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds ; and here &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
so we can use to use the genetic code to write our words , phr@@ ases , thoughts .
ini@@ tially , we just sig@@ ned out .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
we engine@@ ered the pieces so that we could just thre@@ w them out with enzy@@ mes , and there &apos;s an enzy@@ me that re@@ com@@ men@@ ds that and again .
and we started making pieces , starting with se@@ ctions that inclu@@ ded the five to se@@ vent@@ h letters , put them together to wra@@ p them up to 24@@ ,000 pieces of characters to wra@@ p these back up to 7@@ 2,000 .
in each way , we &apos;ve been able to manufac@@ ture these pieces as well as we could sequence it , because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process that you &apos;ll see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball pla@@ yo@@ ff .
if we can get to these really large pieces of sil@@ ence -- with over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- they don &apos;t just grow it in e@@ . col@@ i . it &apos;s all the opportunities of modern molecular biology , and so we res@@ em@@ re other mechanis@@ ms of mechanis@@ ms .
we knew a mechan@@ ism by a mechan@@ ism called home@@ ologist re@@ combin@@ ation , which is using biology to re@@ pair dna that can be put together like this .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans of the three million cycle of radiation .
and you can see in the upp@@ er part that his chromo@@ some just goes apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything again has been put together in this way .
we &apos;ve got thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dry , they can even live inside vac@@ u@@ um .
i &apos;m absolutely certain that life exists in space and can move , looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
indeed , nasa has demon@@ strated that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a fe@@ ature of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we used cro@@ p mechan@@ ism with the real design of the pieces we &apos;ve ad@@ ded it , and then we auto@@ matically put them together auto@@ matically .
this isn &apos;t electr@@ on microscop@@ es . it &apos;s a random microscop@@ e shot .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscop@@ e .
this is video over a long seconds of six seconds .
this is the publi@@ cation that we &apos;ve just finished recently .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters on gene@@ tic@@ ari@@ ous code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure ever created by people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we print it with a dollar of 10 and no de@@ cre@@ ase , it would sum@@ mar@@ ize 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we do a chromo@@ some ? how are we going to chemi@@ ze it ?
now it &apos;s obvious that with a virus , it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s much more complex dealing with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er if you do it in eu@@ car@@ y@@ on@@ ts as we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nu@@ cle@@ us out and you put another inside , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about the c@@ lon@@ ing .
with arch@@ a@@ e@@ bacteria , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but just recently , we &apos;ve shown you that you can take a full transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and to activ@@ ate those activ@@ ate .
we created the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ bi@@ al species , roughly , and we &apos;ve been able to pick these two together as humans and mi@@ ce , and we put some extra genes to destro@@ y the proteins , and it was very amazing when we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to ask our very extraordinary graph@@ ations here .
the new chromo@@ some was going into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we tried to get the process a little bit further .
this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution over here .
now , we &apos;re finding all sorts of species here that made a second chromo@@ some , or a third of any time , each given thousands of characteri@@ stics each time in just one second .
so people who think of evolution as an gene has changed that at a time has been commit@@ ted by a lot of biology .
there &apos;s an enzy@@ me enzy@@ mes called the restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that are actually di@@ gest@@ ing dna .
the chromo@@ some that &apos;s in the cell has no one ; the chromo@@ som@@ es that we &apos;ve ad@@ ded out of .
it was ex@@ hau@@ sted in the cell , and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as the alien material , and so we ended up with one cell with a new chromo@@ some .
it broke up blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve been ad@@ ded to .
and after a very short time , there was all of the characteri@@ stics of species that were lost and conver@@ ted completely into a new species on the new software that we &apos;ve given to the cell .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es were changing -- as we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we &apos;ve trans@@ fer@@ red to .
it may sound like genom@@ ics al@@ ch@@ im@@ ren@@ ia , but we can move out of the software dna , things quite dra@@ matically .
now , i &apos;ve been argu@@ ing that this is not the gen@@ es@@ is -- it &apos;s based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve been argu@@ ing that we may be able to create a new form of cam@@ brian explosion in which there might be massive new ar@@ ray of millions of education based on this digital design .
why would we have to do that ?
i think it &apos;s kind of obvious in terms of what we need .
we are growing up from si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half billion people for over the next 40 years .
in order to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
today , there are three people on this planet for every one of 194@@ 6 in 194@@ 6 ; in 40 years , it will be four .
we &apos;ve got problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , 100 billion people for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge to offer that for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0-@@ plus billion mass of oil , and that &apos;s a hundred million cu@@ be per day .
when we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the entire carbon of this material that land@@ es in the atmosphere .
so we &apos;ve got , from all the disco@@ ver@@ ies from all over the world , a dat@@ ab@@ ase of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design compon@@ ent components of the future .
the electr@@ on@@ alists &apos; electric industry had a do@@ zen compon@@ ent and look at the diversity that they came up with .
we &apos;re going to be here first with the limit@@ s of biological reality , and in our imagination of the imagination .
we now have technologies based on this very fast syn@@ thes@@ e@@ s-@@ based technology to do what we call combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gene@@ tics .
so we &apos;ve now got the possibility of building a big robot that can make millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
so if you can make these 20 million different genes , or to optimi@@ ze these processes around oc@@ ogra@@ tan or drugs , drugs , we can change new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can change more molecular biology than for the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just a small compon@@ ent@@ line . we can sel@@ ec@@ tively sel@@ ec@@ tively sel@@ ec@@ tively sel@@ ec@@ ze , production of chemicals , carbon production and so on .
this is a picture of effective design software that we &apos;re working with , which are actually available to you and design new species of computers on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly what their genetic code is going to look like .
now we &apos;re now foc@@ using on green@@ fu@@ ma green@@ zing our fourth generation .
you saw a bad experiment recently of eth@@ an@@ ol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have these two and third generations that are going to come out fairly soon , that will have much higher tra@@ ck@@ ness , like oc@@ tic@@ ol or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but , as we think , the only way that politicians have a huge impact without any increase on food or the limit@@ ation of their avail@@ ability is going to be , when we see co2 as re@@ vie@@ ws , and that &apos;s why we work on cells that are going to go this way .
and we think we &apos;ll be the first generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sun@@ light and co2 are a way of a method .
but in our disco@@ ver@@ ies of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organis@@ m that we described in &apos; 8@@ 6 .
it lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , due to che@@ ating water temper@@ atures .
it conver@@ ts co2 in me@@ than@@ e by using hydro@@ gen &apos;s use as a source of energy .
we &apos;re going to study whether we can use appropriate co2 , which can easily be put in production direc@@ tions , the co2 in the fuel to run this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- moder@@ ate goals like the re@@ plac@@ ement of all the pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry , which is , if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a source of energy to become energy .
but for the same way , we &apos;re currently working on building the same approach@@ es to the development of vac@@ cin@@ es .
you &apos;ve seen it with flu this year , we &apos;re always going back a year and give a dollar to a little bit when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
and i think that this can be changed by re@@ mix@@ ing in@@ puts vac@@ cin@@ es in the introdu@@ ction .
that &apos;s what the future might look like in terms of changes today , able to acceler@@ ate evolutionary tree with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ tin , and perhaps eu@@ car@@ y@@ on@@ tes .
we are able to improve people &apos;s light years since that , and our goal is to survive long enough to be able to survive that . thank you very much .
last ted conference , i ad@@ ded an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i promis@@ ed to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so there it is . and for those of us who were not there at the time , the l@@ h@@ c is the biggest scientific trial that has ever been asked -- 27 miles across the diam@@ e@@ ter .
its job is to create the conditions which were less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the beginning of the universe -- and that &apos;s up to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing ambi@@ tious .
so this is the machine underneath gen@@ ev@@ a .
we take images of these mini@@ -@@ gro@@ xes into dete@@ c@@ tors .
this is me with me . he &apos;s called at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 feet in the wid@@ th , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
here &apos;s a spec@@ tac@@ ular picture of at@@ las in the construction , so you can see the scale of scale .
on september 10@@ th , last year , the machine was going to be on the scene for the first time
and this is a picture taken by at@@ las .
it made huge ju@@ vel@@ al ju@@ gs in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first ten@@ sion of pit@@ les that re@@ de@@ dic@@ ated the entire way around the l@@ h@@ c , then colli@@ ded with a part of the l@@ h@@ c to rele@@ ase a rain of particles that would sh@@ ine on the dete@@ ctor .
in other words , when we saw this picture on the 10@@ th of september , we knew that the machine worked , which is a big tri@@ um@@ ph .
i don &apos;t know if this would create the biggest ju@@ g , or this , when somebody went to google side , and this was how it came back .
it means that we &apos;ve reach@@ ed an cultural influence next to the scientific meeting .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wir@@ es -- these golden wir@@ es here , these golden wir@@ es .
and these wir@@ es use 13@@ -@@ thousand am@@ ples when the machine is on high performance .
now , the engineers am@@ on@@ gst you are going to look and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . these are small wir@@ es . &quot;
they can stick this because if you slow them down very far , they become called super@@ conduc@@ tors .
at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ ter than the room between stars , these wir@@ es can hold the ten@@ sion to hold .
in one of the com@@ pounds , between over a billion str@@ ands in the l@@ h@@ c , there was an ap@@ poin@@ tor fe@@ eding .
and with that , the wir@@ es he@@ ating smaller and 13 thousand am@@ ples suddenly en@@ counter@@ s an electrical resi@@ stance .
so this was the result .
now , all of this is even more amazing when you think that the magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons and sho@@ ved around about 30 centi@@ meters .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of these magne@@ ts .
and i had to re@@ move them what we were doing .
and we re@@ condi@@ tioned them , they re@@ pair them .
they &apos;re all back back to their path .
at the end of the mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will re@@ co@@ ver@@ se .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and we expect to collect the first data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and we continue our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , a sort of acci@@ dent@@ al acci@@ dents , the debate of this acci@@ dents repe@@ at around the value of science and engineering to these bor@@ ders . it &apos;s easy to dis@@ miss anything like that .
and i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limit@@ ations , shapes the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist , hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who i guess de@@ dic@@ ated to the development of the human mind , that there &apos;s no myster@@ y to the development of the human mind than to assu@@ me that there are no myster@@ ies in nature that our tri@@ um@@ p@@ es are soli@@ d-@@ wander@@ ed , and that there &apos;s no new worl@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
thank you very much .
i &apos;m a writing guy .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s , of course , more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , life@@ -@@ long love and fascin@@ ation .
and i &apos;m not expe@@ cting you to always change that .
however , a little bit more curious in my life and my career that led me to re@@ think my relationship to this work completely to re@@ think .
this strange thing was that i had written a book recently -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called kni@@ cal , pra@@ y , my love -- that went apart from all of my previous books , and a big me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , international publi@@ sh@@ er , became international publi@@ s@@ eller thing .
and the result is , i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m pun@@ ched the dec@@ line .
seriously -- the pun@@ ch@@ line !
for example , you get very concerned to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never over@@ come that success ?
don &apos;t worry about spending your whole life and never create a book that anyone in the world ? never again ? ari@@ phone .
al@@ right , this makes really coura@@ ty .
however , it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was over 20 years ago when i was a teenager told for the first time that i was going to be a writer with the same kind of failed response response .
people said , you don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re afraid to have succe@@ e@@ ded ?
don &apos;t you worry about killing the hu@@ mili@@ ation of a vote ? &quot;
you &apos;re not afraid that you &apos;ll spend that work of service for your life and never comes out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a tur@@ ro@@ w@@ y store -- your mouth filled with the bit@@ ter hat of the de@@ vil@@ s ?
something like that , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : metaphor is yes .
yeah , i &apos;m fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed in all of these things .
and i &apos;d always had it .
and i was sc@@ ared about a lot more stuff that nobody would inv@@ ent .
like al@@ ga@@ e -- and other fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things .
but when it &apos;s graphi@@ cs , i think i &apos;ve been thinking about this for a couple of minutes , and i wonder : why ?
is it a sensi@@ ble ?
is it logi@@ cal that you should be expected by someone that he &apos;s afraid to do the work that he feels ?
and what exactly do you think about the creative eng@@ ages that they make us un@@ sec@@ ure about what makes us feel un@@ sec@@ ure -- in a way that other professi@@ ons don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t really think of a situation in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist in which he was asked whether he was afraid to be chem@@ ist .
with your chem@@ ist blo@@ des , john -- how about this ?
it just didn &apos;t come out , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemi@@ sts have not received the repu@@ tation of the cent@@ u@@ ries of al@@ co@@ hol mon@@ ologi@@ ous man@@ -@@ depres@@ sed people .
and we wri@@ ters to have wri@@ ters like this , but not just the wri@@ ters , but the creative of all gen@@ r@@ es , may seem to have this call , which is a mental , ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
all you have to do is to look at the bit@@ ter death fig@@ ures from really great minds alone from the 20th century , the young and a lot of their own hands .
and even those who don &apos;t actually pick su@@ i@@ ci@@ des , they seemed to be really ne@@ g@@ le@@ cted by their tal@@ ents .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er just said before his last interview : radio each of my books has passed me a little bit further .
it &apos;s an extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can do about your life &apos;s work .
but we don &apos;t even address when we &apos;re listening to somebody like this for so long , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of commit@@ ment for so long , so we &apos;ve accep@@ ted that creativity and fear are somehow kind of related and that art -- at the end -- always leads to the sea qu@@ al .
so the question that i &apos;d like to ask everyone to here today is , is this idea of it completely fine ?
feel that ? because with only one centi@@ meter , i don &apos;t feel comfortable at all -- i don &apos;t feel like i &apos;m thinking about that .
i think that &apos;s what i &apos;m sure .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken over to the next part of the century
i think it will be better if we live our great creative as@@ sau@@ di@@ a@@ c .
and i absolutely know that it &apos;s -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to start out of the dark path of your mind -- especially in the mean@@ condition where i just found myself in my career .
this is actually -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years of my time in me .
and it &apos;s im@@ men@@ sely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from this is what i &apos;m going to be writing from the world as the work that &apos;s been achie@@ ved after my last book , right ?
well , i &apos;m sorry , because we &apos;re all sort of friends now -- it &apos;s extremely likely to be my greatest success behind me .
oh , jes@@ us , what kind of thought !
these are the kind of thinking that can make you start to catch at 9 o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would like to keep doing all this work that i love .
and so the question is : how ?
i think , after some time of refle@@ cting refle@@ cts , i seem to be able to write , to continue to write a kind of pat@@ cher of psych@@ ological con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts .
and somehow , from now , i &apos;ve got to find a way of preser@@ ving a safe distance between myself and my very natural in@@ struc@@ tions about what the writing will be for writing .
during the last year , i &apos;ve cho@@ sen models to do this , i &apos;ve been looking for myself in the past and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see whether they can help creative risks , to see whether they can rel@@ ate to the emotional risks that are associated with creativity .
this was a qu@@ est that led me to the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and the old ro@@ me .
please join me , because the circle will end up again .
but in ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ro@@ me , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity is coming from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of di@@ v@@ ine di@@ vor@@ ce mind that occur@@ s from a dist@@ ant , un@@ known source to the people -- from un@@ expla@@ ined , un@@ known reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks used to call these di@@ v@@ ine di@@ vor@@ ce spi@@ ths of creativity of mouse songs .
from soc@@ rates , he &apos;s known that he believed that he would have a du@@ m@@ m@@ one that was going on to tell him from a dist@@ ant distance .
the b@@ arb@@ s had the same idea , and they called this kind of body tra@@ de-@@ off of body mind a tele@@ geni@@ us .
this is great . the mp@@ s didn &apos;t really think that a geni@@ us was particularly bright individual .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine cre@@ ature that was believed , literally in the walls of an artist at@@ eli@@ a -- sort of like do@@ bby , the hou@@ ev@@ ine -- who came out and made the artist at work somehow invisible , and made the result of the work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that i was talking about from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it was so working , right ?
the artist of aging was prote@@ cted with certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ s@@ m , right ?
when your work was brilli@@ antly , you didn &apos;t want to look all for you all , everyone knew you had this therap@@ y geni@@ us that helped you .
if your work was flo@@ ating -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everyone knew , &quot; your geni@@ us was a little la@@ w .
so people in the west have been thinking about creativity for a really long time .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures to embra@@ ce comm@@ ands from the di@@ v@@ ine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and the people started to believe that creativity completely came from the individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people who call this geni@@ us , or those of us who will call geni@@ us , instead of having a geni@@ us .
i &apos;ve got to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
you know ? i think you have a really comfortable person to allow that he thinks he or she is like the ves@@ sel and the essen@@ ce of all the di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ known myster@@ i@@ ous myster@@ i@@ ous myster@@ y for death to death for a story@@ telling , human psy@@ che .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
that &apos;s cap@@ turing and di@@ stor@@ ted all of the e@@ gos and it creates all those in@@ do@@ ors of expec@@ tations in success .
i think that this success of success has dro@@ pped our artists over the past 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s right , and i think it &apos;s really true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps a long-term understanding of the relationship between people and the myster@@ y of the creative return come back .
maybe you don &apos;t .
maybe we can not just d@@ ele@@ te this thought from 500 years of rational human@@ ism in a 18@@ -@@ minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who really would be issu@@ ing real scientific dou@@ bt about the idea of -- generally -- fe@@ a@@ thers , people , follow pur@@ su@@ ing and fe@@ ating magic on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you to this journey , probably .
but the question i &apos;m trying to leave is : why not ?
why not thinking about it that way ?
because it makes just as much meaning as anything i &apos;ve heard about when it was about doing absolutely in@@ san@@ e an@@ gi@@ di@@ ties of the creative process .
it &apos;s a process that -- like everybody knows it &apos;s ever tried to make something -- so in other words , everyone here is actually -- don &apos;t always think sensi@@ bly .
in fact , sometimes it can feel very par@@ an@@ or@@ an@@ an@@ o@@ ic .
i had recently met as an extraordinary american di@@ et in ru@@ th stone , who was now about 90 , but she told me that she was working outside of the fields , and she said she was working outside of the fields , she said she could feel and hear a po@@ em about the landscape on them .
she would be like a d@@ res@@ der of air in the air .
they &apos;re going to roll across the country .
she felt when it came , because it would get the earth under their feet to the be@@ ak@@ ers .
she knew that she was able to do one of those same time , and that was -- in her words -- sc@@ or@@ es like the de@@ vil radio .
and they ran like the de@@ vil to the house while they were pur@@ pos@@ ed by this po@@ em , except they had to get quickly enough to make a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil so they could catch it through , you could catch it and hold on the side of your hand .
in other painting she wasn &apos;t fast enough , she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the po@@ em roll@@ ed over and ran it . she kept going to keep looking across land , looking for a different po@@ et looking for another po@@ et .
and then these moments -- i &apos;ll never forget the part of it -- she said there were moments in the moment that they almost mis@@ sed it .
so she goes to the house and looking for the paper , and the po@@ em comes through through it , and she just pus@@ hes a pen , and she just said -- she said -- it was as if she could reach out with your other hand and you get it to ki@@ ck it .
and they came up with the po@@ em on his tail and put it back in her body and took it on the she@@ et of paper .
in these opportunities , the po@@ em came in , and in@@ t@@ act on paper -- but back@@ wards -- from the last word for the first slide .
and when i heard that , i thought that pain@@ t@@ ari@@ um is in@@ her@@ ently -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
this isn &apos;t my creative process at all -- i &apos;m not the chan@@ nel .
i &apos;m a female ballo@@ on . to work on work , i have to stand up every day at the same time and swe@@ at , re@@ co@@ vering me and really un@@ pleas@@ ant .
but even in my mouth , sometimes i &apos;ve got this thing out of it .
and i guess many of you have done this as well .
even i had work or ideas that came out of a source through me that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s this thing ?
and how do we deal with it without losing our minds , but to hold ourselves in the opposite part , but do we even hold ourselves to stran@@ ger health ?
for me , the best example of how you can do this , the best example of this can create tom wa@@ its . i had to interview it for a magazine several years ago .
we talked about this top@@ ic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the cele@@ br@@ ating modern artist who tried to domin@@ ate those un@@ controll@@ able creative vehi@@ cles that lived in him and to come to them with them .
but then he became older and quie@@ t . he told me that one day he died at a spee@@ se street in los angeles . and then everything changed for him .
he wa@@ gs at high speed when he suddenly sounds a small frag@@ ment of a mel@@ o@@ dy that &apos;s very difficult for him to do , and he wants it . it &apos;s stun@@ ning . it le@@ ck@@ tens after@@ wards , but he can &apos;t believe it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a ta@@ pe record .
so , he &apos;s beginning to get up this old dri@@ ft up in it , like , for example , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be tra@@ pped by this song for lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t get it . i don &apos;t get any
but instead of p@@ ani@@ cking in , he just stopped listening .
he ended up getting all the thought of thought and doing something completely new .
he just looked into the sky , and he said , &quot; metaphor apo@@ logi@@ ze , can you not see that i &apos;m a car ? &quot;
now , i look like i &apos;m going to write a song like this .
if you really want to be there , come back to a bad moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , somebody else &apos;s ex@@ hau@@ ves to today .
go and cra@@ ck leon@@ ard co@@ hen . art .
his whole job process has been changed since then .
it &apos;s not the work itself . it &apos;s often been as dark as the e@@ oh and ever .
but the process that surro@@ unded him , and the heavy ra@@ il that surro@@ unds him , was where he had no trouble and left it back to him where he came back and left him , and he realized that it was not an inter@@ rup@@ ted , b@@ und@@ le thing .
it was able to give a strange , wonderful , bizar@@ re collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the foreign , ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating thing that was not quite a master .
now , when i heard this story , it changed a little bit of the way that i worked , and it res@@ cu@@ ed me before .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing of cool museum , pra@@ y , my love , i fell into one of the gr@@ u@@ bs of the dou@@ bt that we all fall when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not going to work , and it &apos;s going to be the worst book ever written .
not just bad , it &apos;s the worst of all .
i started to think , well , i just ought to work on this project .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed tom had talked in the wild sky , and i tried to do it .
so i looked at my view from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt , and i spoke to a blan@@ k corner of the space .
and i said , &quot; look , you and i know both , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fau@@ lt , right ?
because , you know , i &apos;m invest@@ ing , i don &apos;t have anything that i own . i
so , if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to cross your percentage here and main@@ tain your share of the process .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then the hell with it .
and i &apos;m going to keep going , because that &apos;s my job .
and i would like to give you proto@@ col@@ l that i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... and at the end of it , it &apos;s like , before cent@@ u@@ ries , in the desert of northern africa , people have gather@@ ed to the desert comm@@ and@@ ments with hol@@ y dan@@ cers and music that had been stopped for hours -- all the way to da@@ wn .
these fe@@ ar@@ est things were great always because the dan@@ cers were profession@@ ally , and they were fantastic .
but once again , very rare , something special happened . one of the edi@@ tors was actually over@@ -@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know all of you in your life have seen such a performance of performance .
it was as if the time would be st@@ res@@ sing and the dan@@ cers through a way -- he hadn &apos;t done anything else but he ever did it before -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but it all related together .
and all of a sudden , he never appe@@ ared to human@@ di@@ ties anymore .
it was ill@@ umin@@ ated from inside , and below the bottom , and everything was raised through a di@@ v@@ ine fire .
and when that happened , the people knew what it was , and they called it under his name .
they put the hands together and they started sing@@ ing : drawing al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . radio .
that &apos;s god , do you know ?
interesting histor@@ ical foot@@ note : when the crow@@ ds , they launched this practice with the cent@@ u@@ ries of fig@@ al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h &apos;s art@@ -@@ over , bo@@ om , ol@@ k paint that you still hear in nu@@ t fight and fl@@ am@@ be@@ g@@ ent@@ ers .
if a person in spa@@ in in spa@@ in did something impossible , something ma@@ gical , t@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ vo , al@@ la@@ h , there it is : a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , you know , the tri@@ cky part comes out the next morning when the dan@@ cer hits himself and reali@@ zes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;@@ clock in a tu@@ es@@ day -- and he &apos;s no longer carrying a fif@@ th of god .
it &apos;s just an aging of the market with pain@@ ful k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe it &apos;s never going to clim@@ b up to that hei@@ ght .
and maybe somebody will never call god name when it &apos;s ro@@ tat@@ ing , but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s one of the most pain@@ est cor@@ rec@@ tions of a creative life .
but perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be kind of p@@ ure , if you didn &apos;t believe from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of her sense of you came from .
and if you think that you &apos;re a co@@ st-@@ up -- you might think that you &apos;re an in@@ significant source of a time of your life that will pass to someone else when you &apos;re finished .
so when we start to think about this , all of this changes .
so , i started thinking and i think with security in the past months , while i worked on the book that &apos;s going to be coming soon -- as the dangerous , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , clo@@ sely expected after@@ wards of my des@@ sen@@ ence .
what i have to say to myself constantly , when i &apos;m crazy , is not fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed .
don &apos;t be dis@@ con@@ stra@@ ined .
just just do your job .
you know , still for your contribu@@ tion there , whatever he is .
if your job is dan@@ cing , dan@@ cing .
if the stupid di@@ v@@ ine geni@@ us , which is put to you , is to decide , for a brief moment , to show a h@@ arb@@ or of wonder through your effort , you then want to be a ph@@ ol@@
and if you don &apos;t , dance though your dance is .
and c@@ lon@@ es ! designers for you , too .
and i believe in it , and i feel that we should teach this .
to@@ ken ! designers for you , simply for yourself , is for you to have the na@@ tive human love and your sense of self to be there .
why thank you .
why thank you .
ol@@ sh !
last year , i showed these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice tan@@ tra@@ cks that had the size of the bottom of the 4@@ 8 states , is the size of the bottom of the 4@@ 8 states , is ro@@ pped 40 percent .
but that doesn &apos;t really answer the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
and , in a sense , the arc@@ tic ice sk@@ e is the be@@ ating heart of our global climate system .
it gro@@ ws in the winter and it s@@ hr@@ in@@ ks in summer .
so the next slide that i &apos;m going to show you is a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se shot of what &apos;s happened over the past 25 years .
the re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e ice is lab@@ el@@ ed with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue , and this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter , and it s@@ hr@@ in@@ ks in summer .
what &apos;s called the perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which blo@@ ws out of your body here .
it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here in 25 years .
so this is a problem because the warming is the fro@@ zen reason around the arc@@ tic ocean , where there &apos;s large amo@@ unts of fro@@ zen carbon , which is when it leaves , it &apos;s ill@@ umin@@ ated by micro@@ bes to me@@ than@@ e .
compared to the whole amount of climate change in the atmosphere , if we cross that amount of climate change in the atmosphere , it could double that amount .
already today , in some flat la@@ ke la@@ ke in al@@ as@@ ka me@@ than@@ e , of himself from the water .
professor kat@@ vis@@ wal@@ ter of university in al@@ as@@ ka has travel@@ ed with another group of working to another la@@ ke la@@ ke in the la@@ ke of west last winter .
who@@ a !
it &apos;s okay . the question is how it &apos;s going to get us .
and one reason is to get this massive obser@@ vement of heat to green@@ land from the north .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al de@@ water river .
but the volu@@ me of volu@@ us is much bigger than ever before .
this is the ri@@ dge valley in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know what the sea level of ice ice is going up here , it &apos;s going to drop into the ocean .
the ri@@ vers are getting very fast .
on the other side of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ice mass on the planet .
so last month , researchers repor@@ ted that the entire continent has a negative ice bil@@ l@@ board .
and the west ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which emer@@ ged over a few under@@ water is@@ lands , is very strong in mel@@ ting .
this is like 20 feet of sea al@@ titude , like green@@ land .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest ice mass , they &apos;re looking at new la@@ kes that were gl@@ aci@@ ers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king wat@@ ers from this s@@ ma@@ p@@ i@@ zing water .
in the off@@ sh@@ ore , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the drin@@ k@@ water source for this city .
the water levels have been exp@@ and@@ ed .
but then , when you for@@ age , most drin@@ king water will drop away .
in california , a 40 percent redu@@ ction of the si@@ er@@ ra has been vie@@ wed out of the si@@ er@@ ra .
this hol@@ ds your memory bas@@ in .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
and so this dri@@ ll@@ ing rate throughout the world leads to a dra@@ matic increase in fire .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers all over the glo@@ be have had a really extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ ding ex@@ pos@@ ure to that .
four times as many people in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 years .
this is an extremely in@@ hal@@ able development pattern .
and if you look at this in histor@@ ical context , you can see what it &apos;s about .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve got 70 million tons of co2 produ@@ ces every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
if you look at the scop@@ e of the eastern pacific , the american continent west , and both of the indian sub@@ continent , where there &apos;s a dra@@ matic dec@@ line of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , bes@@ i@@ des de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is burning of fossil fu@@ els .
oil is a problem , and coal is the equ@@ est problem .
and the united states is one of the most large fil@@ e@@ est pollu@@ ters , together with china
and the pro@@ pos@@ al was to build a lot of more carbon fac@@ tor@@ ies .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that have been taken in the last few years with some green alterna@@ tives that have been pro@@ posed .
and general , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the co@@ wers and the ce@@ dr@@ ine and the ce@@ lin@@ du@@ stri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter billion dollars of last cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s to de@@ dic@@ ate clean coal , which is already a con@@ tradi@@ ction .
now , this picture remin@@ ded me of something .
around christ@@ mas , at home , at home in ten@@ nes@@ see , there was a billion tons of cooking lam@@ p .
you seem to be able to see it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the second largest waste river in america .
this was what happened after christ@@ mas .
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of the coal income industry for christ@@ mas was this one .
&quot; fro@@ gh@@ ty of the orange man is a pleasure , fro@@ st-@@ happy bur@@ ch .
it &apos;s going to be in sh@@ ell and pl@@ ent@@ y of america , and it helps to grow our economy .
it &apos;s fro@@ sty , it &apos;s going to be cle@@ an@@ ed every single day .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and wor@@ th@@ while , and workers are sta@@ ying in pla@@ gue and bread .
this is the source of most of the coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the most powerful min@@ ter is the head of mas@@ sey com@@ po@@ und .
let me say one very clearly : al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry ri@@ d , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection had establi@@ shed two cam@@ pus .
this is one , a part of it .
in co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we &apos;re seeing climate change as a serious dan@@ ger for our business .
so we set down to the top line , to give up a substan@@ tial amount of money , to get a de@@ dic@@ ation on the road , to get the truth via coal
the fact is , coal is not a dir@@ ty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also very good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change , you know ?
let it leave that very easy to us .
clean coal cle@@ an@@ ed , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s do a tour of this modern , clean coal plant .
a@@ wes@@ ome ! this machine is pretty l@@ oud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
and yet , burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the most remarkable clean coal technology that you see here changes everything .
well , if you look very carefully , this is the clean , clean coal technology .
finally , the positive cultures combin@@ ed with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thre@@ ad that conne@@ cts them all is our depen@@ dence of carbon based on fu@@ an@@ ous coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bra@@ ve , new solution to en@@ h@@ ance us from this no@@ mor@@ ous position .
they re@@ brand america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan of getting america back to work to make us sec@@ ure and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution , it &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
dig@@ ge@@ ty america . find more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s all about a new supply of america .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways , our depen@@ dence of ancient , dir@@ ty forces , that attra@@ ct our world to attra@@ ct .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to create well-@@ paid jobs .
care for america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go ahead and go .
if you want to come far , go in and go . &quot;
we need to get far , and we have to get far .
thank you very much .
so i want to start by asking you to go back to the time of your age when you &apos;re playing with building blocks .
as they realized how to stre@@ tch and nur@@ turing the hands , they actually learned and move , they actually learned , and fundament@@ ally , through understanding and change , we actually learned about understanding and change environment .
spa@@ tial thinking is clo@@ sely related to how we understand a great deal of our surro@@ und@@ ings .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction of real objects -- with my wor@@ med pat@@ l@@ ate pat@@ ti and my collea@@ gue je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i began to wonder : what if we could interven@@ e with both hands and interven@@ e data that could be physi@@ cally dete@@ cted , and how do we want to interven@@ e data that way , how do we want it ?
and the question was so attra@@ ctive that we decided to investi@@ gate the answer , and we developed si@@ cky path@@ ways .
in short , a si@@ gi@@ ble thing is an inter@@ active computer inside the size of a coo@@ k@@ ie .
you can be transpor@@ ted by hand , you can percei@@ ve each other , you can draw your mov@@ ements , and you can have a screen and you have a radio recei@@ ver .
what &apos;s more important is that are physical , so you can just move them out like building sounds and move away from the hands of hands and moving .
and the si@@ st@@ able ones are an example of a new generation of tools to manipu@@ lation digital data .
and if these tools are going to become energi@@ tious and develop awareness for their mov@@ ements , each recogni@@ tion and the fe@@ a@@ thers of our ancestors , we can start to see each other , we can start to explore new and inter@@ se@@ cting inter@@ actions .
and i &apos;ll start with a couple simple examples .
now , this si@@ de@@ able thing is that for the video re@@ fin@@ able , and if i ta@@ p it down , the video will play forward , if i p@@ lot it down in the other direction , it &apos;s going back@@ wards .
and those inter@@ active portra@@ its are actually taking each other to happen .
so if i put them on the side of each other , that &apos;s going to be your interest .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded of the surro@@ und@@ ess , if you &apos;re surro@@ unded , you &apos;ll notice this , and you can get a little nervous
and they feel just as well as their movement and cur@@ ren@@ cy .
so one interesting way of using the inter@@ actions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gest@@ ures to data to protect the sun like this , how do you do this with flu@@ ids ?
in this case , we &apos;ve con@@ fig@@ ged three si@@ tic@@ als of paint as a paint of paint , and i can use it to po@@ ur paint in the middle , where they get mix@@ ed up .
if we over@@ do it , we can sho@@ ve back a little bit .
there are also some ne@@ at opportunities in education like languages , math or allo@@ c@@ ot@@ es , where we give people the opportunity to bear , and see what the results of the fast trial are happening immediately .
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i series , which i write with a simple equ@@ ation program .
this is a play with words , which is kind of a mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
you basically get any r@@ ence on every si@@ st@@ able level of random letters , and as you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re going to te@@ ar them over a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , they &apos;re mix@@ ed , and you &apos;ve got a new letter combin@@ ation and new kind of opportunities .
thank you very much .
these are a bunch of kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i was able to get you out of it and make a video of it and i took a video of it
and they really loved it .
an interesting thing about this kind of appli@@ cations is you don &apos;t have to give people lots and lots of comm@@ ands to people .
all you have to say is &quot; forms words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
so here are a couple of the folks who test it .
and this is our yo@@ unger be@@ ta@@ -@@ test test there down@@ sta@@ irs .
and it turns out that he wanted to st@@ ack the city in si@@ p@@ ens .
so for him , they were just building bla@@ des .
this is an inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ graph@@ y ima@@ ging .
and we wanted to develop a learning tool for language learning .
so this is fe@@ li@@ x .
he can put new characters into the scene by exp@@ and@@ ing the si@@ de@@ ways of the table that shows this figure .
here , he &apos;s going to wind the sun up .
the sun goes on on top .
now , he &apos;s cat@@ ching a tra@@ ctor into the scene .
it &apos;s the orange tra@@ ctor .
good work ! yes !
by sha@@ king the si@@ de@@ scale , and then it can give the characters to each other on top of each other ...
well , his own story inv@@ ent .
hell@@ o !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and it can decide how it evol@@ ves .
rob@@ bing c@@ at .
the last example i &apos;ve got today to show it is a musical sequence of mine on live recor@@ ds , which we &apos;ve developed recently in the simpl@@ est position as a no@@ gue , as leaders , b@@ ass and stuff .
each has four different vari@@ ations ; you can sele@@ ct what you want to use .
and you can take these sound into the sequence that you can possibly repli@@ cate in any pattern .
and you stick in , just by holding a ton@@ -@@ si@@ stable to a sequence si@@ gi@@ bility .
and those are effects that you can change live , like korea and filter .
you put it in with a particular t@@ one and then ten@@ der it to hi@@ re it .
and then even co@@ ver@@ er effects like p@@ ace and noise that you use in the entire sequence of the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s have a look .
so what we &apos;re starting to do in which we eat the gui@@ dance of two experiment@@ al si@@ zes , and then ar@@ ran@@ ged them in a series , exp@@ and and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i &apos;m going to put a b@@ ass up here .
now , i &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it .
and so now i &apos;m going to embra@@ ce the fil@@ ds to the pad so i can control the effect of life .
and i can acceler@@ ate the entire sequence by putting the p@@ ace in one direction or the other direction .
and now i &apos;m going to com@@ bine the filter with the b@@ ass ; i &apos;m making a little bit more expression .
i can negoti@@ ate the sequence as it is going through .
it doesn &apos;t mean that i don &apos;t have to plan you in the cu@@ d@@ ard , but i can impro@@ v@@ ise it , because they &apos;re exten@@ ding or di@@ stor@@ ting it .
and finally , i can reve@@ al the entire sequence by getting the l@@ ate@@ kee@@ hood si@@ ck@@ ness to the left .
thank you very much .
so as you can see , there &apos;s my desire to develop new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ actions that fit better to fit , as our brains and bodies work .
and what i &apos;ve been doing today is giving you a part of this new design world and some of the ways that we work on our lab .
the idea that i want to leave you with is that we are at the th@@ res@@ hold of this new generation of plasti@@ cs towards interaction with digital media , creating the information to our dem@@ ands that we need .
thank you very much .
so i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to talk to all of you .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted i &apos;m there .
yeah , so , what &apos;s going to be organic ha@@ cking ?
i &apos;ve got to take out a little bit , and this is a bio@@ ha@@ x , i think , with modern molecular biology
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been working through the bio@@ ha@@ x for a few years now , and i &apos;ve started , because i just wanted to know more , and i wanted to do it as well as to what i &apos;ve learned in high school .
so , that was my pri@@ mate motivation .
so , it was a curi@@ osity , and i kind of wanted to go quickly to the matter , like this .
now , i think that the molecular biology generally , i think , are generally talking , biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything you &apos;ve got to count , syn@@ thetic biology and so on .
extremely important is already extremely important now , and much more , much more important is going to be in the future .
there &apos;s so much contro@@ versi@@ al things like all these gene@@ tically engine@@ ered plants on the sl@@ um@@ ks .
now , there &apos;s cra@@ ig vent@@ er in the united states , trying to make bio@@ house , so gas@@ ol@@ ine .
under then , there are things that are totally living in life , for example , which most people are not aware of , for example , the so-@@ that allow us to was@@ h with 40 degrees of was@@ hes are also gene@@ tically engine@@ ered enzy@@ mes .
and you can do the list end@@ less@@ ly .
and so , from the interest of this technology , i just went on and i went on to sleep .
so , that &apos;s why there ?
most people know that most people know this from the software industry .
computers ha@@ ck , and then in the media always will go like this , yes , the ha@@ ck@@ ers break somewhere a and cla@@ am data and so on .
it &apos;s very sad to the ha@@ ck@@ point , because that &apos;s not what it really does , what it actually does , and what it &apos;s actually standing behind .
and that &apos;s where the software ha@@ cker , in the early &apos; 7@@ 0s , started with computer rock@@ ets , started with computer rock@@ ets , and also came up with the internet .
and it &apos;s about solving in a play@@ ful , creative way of solving a problem .
and the problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a business problem , it can also be a big problem , it can s@@ wing a question , and how do you make it better , or how do you do it better ?
and it has become lar@@ cated with software , but there &apos;s a whole set of life in the electr@@ on@@ ics , there &apos;s a whole ven@@ d-@@ dollar scene that makes electr@@ on@@ ics to all kinds of fla@@ vor@@ s of stuff .
and now i &apos;m going to say to biology , and i want to take this metaphor out of syn@@ thetic biology , that biology is actually a abstra@@ ct code , which is a abstra@@ ct code , and it &apos;s a abstra@@ ct code that is a abstra@@ ct code , and it &apos;s not just cy@@ ber , and it &apos;s not just cy@@ ber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and so you can also ha@@ ck it , like that , and i found that incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get much deeper into it .
this actually adop@@ ted about two clin@@ th of eight really , these networks .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe and with a co@@ operation in india , but that has now been members of members or active people around the world .
these are more arti@@ stic equipment , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosop@@ her@@ s , and working together with scientists to be able to break out and process the creative , and to process the creative , there &apos;s con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ates and yes , all kinds of things .
but actually , it &apos;s just about trying to find a deeper way of having a play@@ ful way of having a play@@ ful effort with it .
and then you have do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself bi@@ o do@@ t , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o , gene@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@
this is a network from the united states , which is actually the kind of for@@ um , where you &apos;re sitting and talking online , you know .
they &apos;re a little bit of technical er@@ ror and a little bit of business , so that &apos;s where they get asked , hon@@ est@@ ly challen@@ ged questions , then .
and based on these networks that have made the whole popular thing , they &apos;ve developed a scene like this , which i want to repli@@ cate a minute for a minute .
you can see here in the image on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side , which is a ha@@ cker@@ space , essentially a kind of school , a private school , non@@ profit interven@@ tion where anybody can get there .
kids , old , all kinds of people go there to just sit out with them , they &apos;ve enter@@ ed a lab and look at what they can do when these lab proto@@ col@@ s go .
here on the left is a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , hou@@ l-@@ day natural fi@@ bo , which is the one that &apos;s been there for quite a long time
more than these other two networks have been .
they also operate in such a arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct of biological materials , and , of course , also electr@@ on@@ ics and com@@ bine that in a rather dist@@ ur@@ bing way .
so a group from ank@@ ar@@ a that i &apos;ve discovered a while ago , which is a student group of people who want to stay for the public what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve made such a sha@@ f@@ test little action and try to explain people to explain what is bas@@ n@@ .@@ a .
and i got up on top of the other picture of a lec@@ ture in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in the medical museum in the center with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion on the subject .
and this is , yes , this is mostly young people , but the only thing that &apos;s actually agre@@ ed is this fascin@@ ation of technology .
and what can you do about it , and you &apos;re very sensitive to the community and ask , you know , you know what , ok , what do you want to do , you &apos;ve got an interest in you to introdu@@ ce you to that ?
so , ok , now , now , to ha@@ ck biology , you need some material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
but also , what you normally understand in a lab , that &apos;s kind of like ri@@ pping machines , extremely expensive , extremely fit@@ ted , just for profession@@ als , educ@@ ated acade@@ mi@@ cs with ph@@ .@@ d. and so on .
and what we &apos;ve been doing was saying , okay , well , that &apos;s actually what you don &apos;t have to do .
it &apos;s not necessary , in fact , because everyone has actually , every coffee machine , actually , used higher technology than most of the computer devices , it &apos;s really like this .
and the o with this pre@@ mis@@ e of this pre@@ mis@@ e , for example , has been trying to put together a minim@@ um of su@@ its in england , and it &apos;s taken a hot pla@@ te and , yes , so he@@ ating paraly@@ sis , and then , you know , it &apos;s grown , and then bacteria can work , and then it would work .
so everyone who has been sha@@ ped once a sou@@ p that he has left for too long , or even before .
i then tried this in my lab in my lab to exp@@ and a little bit , and then bought a little bit of a par@@ er@@ .@@ be@@ am on e@@ bay and made a little bit of a pat@@ er@@ ni@@ est test , so that &apos;s john , n@@ .@@ a finger@@ prin@@ ting , still making home .
it &apos;s supposed to be no jo@@ ke now , but it &apos;s .
down here in the picture you see the lab , in quot@@ es , so this is one garage with a garage like this too , a group in paris as well as a group of paper , which is kind of a successful thing to do , and it &apos;s also quite exciting things , so i &apos;m going to take a little bit of a project , and i &apos;ll also
and this is bio@@ tic@@ um that has just mentioned ha@@ cker@@ space , this is a kind of man@@ k school , basically kind of for molecular biology .
and yeah , so , you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively restri@@ ction , so there are people who do it on their own , until big level of organizations that have been inst@@ all@@ ed in institu@@ tional form , too , in a institu@@ tional form .
but it &apos;s always the kind of approach that it &apos;s going to be easy and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , is true , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re all familiar online , and we &apos;re all familiar online , and we know the people who are there always doing ch@@ ine and stuff .
and then fac@@ ed from the do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ leg@@ ged bi@@ o website , and said , okay , we &apos;ve got to actually meet real , and then we &apos;ve created two events , one in london , two thousand 10 , and shor@@ tly in the united states , in san francisco , and shor@@ tly on the united states , in
and , of course , that &apos;s about , you know , who are we , what do we want to share , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our own target , our foun@@ da@@ tions ?
and then we took a co@@ w-@@ up note like this .
and so this was quite intui@@ tive , so everybody just kind of got his wi@@ sh@@ es , his and what moves to him , and then it expres@@ ses .
and there , i think , a very good model , i think .
and we wouldn &apos;t be d@@ ressed with that , but that &apos;s at least , i think , well , i &apos;ve done pretty well , and people are quite convinced about this .
and then we even tried to bring that back into the acade@@ mic world , but it &apos;s not like that , somehow .
so , i think we &apos;re out of the bio@@ ha@@ cker view , in which , in some cases , a step further than the acade@@ mic world .
okay , so what do we do about this ?
a project that i did with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land itself was that we wanted to have something called an op@@ tical tra@@ p or an op@@ tical br@@ ass .
that &apos;s when you focus on a las@@ er cu@@ b on one room , and then you can catch a little bit of particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , so it &apos;s kind of like a tra@@ p@@ pe@@ al be@@ am in it .
it really works , it &apos;s done in the acade@@ mic origami , and we &apos;ve thought about , okay , we might have a web@@ c@@ am that tun@@ es up , and it turns around , you &apos;ve got a microscop@@ e that la@@ kes up , you have about four hundred times .
that &apos;s what you see down there .
and then we put up a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d cros@@ ner , and the ki@@ te wal@@ ks out the las@@ er and then tries to focus on this camera .
and that didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot .
so , another project that comes from the french group out there from paris , and that &apos;s a pretty cool thing to do .
now , that &apos;s what he &apos;s got to do , like a body wave sche@@ ption , as e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g or something , so he &apos;s involved with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
and he then built this hel@@ met in there , and in the co@@ operating with the museum , was the way to the museum .
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors could go in the room , sit on that chair , to put in that hel@@ met .
and then their bra@@ in@@ waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought , or what they thought they were , then there was pl@@ ent@@ y of lights in the room .
it was a pretty pretty ni@@ g@@ ad project .
another thing that comes from the united states , though , is to do with this kind of ad@@ v@@ ance story , is the p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , which is the poly@@ c@@ as@@ e-@@ ket@@ ric response , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about cop@@ ying genes to repli@@ cate , to repli@@ cate , to produce wol@@ z@@ .@@ a , so that you can easily make it visible .
so now , if i do this now , the pro@@ fil@@ ing of the crime , go there , collect some ha@@ ir@@ sto@@ xes , and then you can say , okay , that &apos;s going to occu@@ r , and then you can say , okay , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this person , like this .
and the machines that do this , they &apos;re pretty expensive that you buy commercial , and the che@@ ap@@ est ones are going to go to four@@ thou@@ 0,000 lo@@ ads .
and that &apos;s not in ho@@ b@@ by@@ soil , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot of it .
so this is just one invol@@ vement of lots of things that can be done with this .
and they &apos;ve ran@@ ged twice two buil@@ ders , and they said , okay , we &apos;re going to do this simpl@@ er and che@@ aper , and we &apos;ve made it easier for open source , so we &apos;ve now brought them up to market stor@@ es , so we &apos;re now the che@@ ap@@ est oper@@ ators of these devices around the glo@@ be .
i think that &apos;s a sort of six dollar dollar sort of stuff , i think .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly in a space where it &apos;s going to be a meas@@ ur@@ able place .
so i think it &apos;s a very safe ha@@ ck , i think .
so a project that i started going on recently was building an ori@@ ent@@ al gun .
gen@@ -@@ clear , yes , like a kind of air@@ print pi@@ mp , which sho@@ ots about as far , two centi@@ meters or anything like that .
you take the clou@@ d@@ .@@ a to the gold particles and then you put the gold particles into these air@@ craft car@@ sto@@ es , and then i &apos;d sho@@ ot them on the oni@@ on and then get them to light like this .
so , the device you see there , that didn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototyp@@ e , which was pretty much po@@ pped up , so that kind of sti@@ cking up on a bran@@ ch of a stick like this , and put it up on top of a bran@@ ch of the thing , and that was too high , that this was too high , that thing had gone down .
and then i took a stit@@ ch@@ and@@ ar pad and put it on it .
a seas@@ on , if you make it full with water , has the enough pressure , so i think , as we might , as 40 or six@@ phic , are about on top .
and so with that , you can acceler@@ ate the partic@@ le enough enough , and then they get into the oni@@ oni@@ ties .
and commercial eng@@ aging costs about 50 pounds up or something like that , so-@@ for fif@@ th dollars like that .
so , they don &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially pro@@ position .
so that &apos;s where , at the moment , the power of the scene is to increase this avail@@ ability of technology and also increasing the information and the understanding of the knowledge that more people can inter@@ f@@ ere with it .
because , at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little reason about it , and there &apos;s no way of making it really well .
because , after all , if you read about it , coming out of second liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same as if you did it yourself .
and i think technology will always become more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be an in@@ formed citi@@ zen as an in@@ formed citi@@ zen in the community and talk to you , you need access to knowledge and to technology .
and you have to do it and understand and understand and understand it .
and this is then , under the ste@@ ad@@ y words , open stimu@@ lation and citi@@ zen science .
so , as citizens , as citizens , as citizens , as they &apos;re wired , they &apos;ve been able to colli@@ de out with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the foun@@ gen@@ ce of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
these are the people who are at least offi@@ cially contribu@@ ted to the website on the website , d.@@ i@@ .@@ on-@@ organic d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g website .
this is actually a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they are also fac@@ ed in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
that &apos;s what i think there are fewer people there , actually , than actually exi@@ sting .
so i know some people who don &apos;t wear each other .
and these are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , the individual people .
it &apos;s par@@ tly related to these ha@@ ck@@ ers , these places where you put these places up there .
and that &apos;s kind of at the beginning .
as i said , there &apos;s been a couple of years .
and ha@@ cking explor@@ er , so the computer ha@@ mm@@ et@@ ment , because the c@@ -@@ base in ber@@ lin was the first , 7@@ -@@ 10,000 10@@ -@@ fif@@ th-@@ five .
and this is now a gigan@@ tic network of very good , nam@@ ely , infrastructure centers that have become repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tional all around the world .
and we hope , of course , that we think of ourselves as a lot of spre@@ ading , and then also related to the same way , so that people can also be enga@@ ged in doing more .
and i would invi@@ te everybody to join themselves up , and to even try to figure out what to do .
it &apos;s not that easy now , but it &apos;s also not possible , unless you have enough curi@@ osity , you have enough energy , then you can get there too far .
thank you very much for listening .
so that &apos;s it .
yeah , hell@@ o .
so , how do we actually work ?
this is a question i &apos;m very moved to as a designer , but also in the cour@@ k of the research and all sorts of things in the field of inter@@ actions .
the point is , how can you look at people in inter@@ active media so that they can use these inter@@ active media , and so they create a very satis@@ fying experience .
i believe that the inter@@ active media in us add@@ res@@ sing us in our arch@@ a@@ era , cognitive models , thinking patterns that have been progra@@ mm@@ ed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can now pull back to this one by inter@@ active media .
and this is amazing , because you actually think that this huge technology that you &apos;ve found is that you actually bring you into the future , but , in fact , the future is for us , with our arch@@ a@@ an roots .
now , what &apos;s actually arch@@ a@@ ian models now ?
now , i wrote four words , and i would like to explain to you that brie@@ fly brie@@ ra@@ tions .
according to arch@@ a@@ an cognitive models , these are the models that we &apos;ve ad@@ ded in the pre-@@ industrial times .
in these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we &apos;ve heard that we have essentially natural propor@@ tion to virtu@@ ality .
this sounds unusual for some of the time .
and i &apos;m going to leave you with just a moment , and i &apos;m going to prove you through trying to have natural ra@@ ti@@ o of virtu@@ ality .
second aspe@@ ct is that since this arch@@ a@@ ical model , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very specific , even though we &apos;re using a co@@ di@@ fied language today .
and the third area , it turns out , is actually about itself .
we all know that inter@@ active media is full of non-@@ non-@@ lin@@ ear , which inclu@@ des the idea of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and what tells us , of course , is that lin@@ ear@@ ity feels a normal sense of normal .
the fourth one is that the story for us is a place of information on us .
now , what about the virtu@@ ality that &apos;s actually the natural thing in the world .
and i want to prove that to you .
how many of the do@@ ors have the house in which they live in ?
i think we &apos;re not going to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through this house , in the mind they live in their lives , and look at how many do@@ ors there are .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s virtu@@ alized the reality of reality , all of us without computers .
a@@ wes@@ ome , yes ?
and that &apos;s where we &apos;re comfortable at the media cam@@ pus , telling us the virtual reality of our v@@ .@@ r@@ . laboratory , we can actually do this all the time .
and that ability to virtu@@ alize virtu@@ ali@@ zing the reality that people have had in the pre-@@ industrial times as well as bit@@ ter , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they were not having books .
or they don &apos;t have a key@@ l-@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing they &apos;ve had was their head .
and there was a remin@@ der in that head , and it was memor@@ i@@ zed .
in this head , knowledge has been dec@@ lin@@ ed , and using these virtual images , the imagination , the beginning , were also being passed on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so heavy inside of us that we can deal with virtu@@ ality as well .
and the interesting thing is , if i can take a little trip out of it .
yeah , that &apos;s what you do .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that at that time , the person of the brain at the same time has media produ@@ cers and medium itself .
now , if you keep thinking a little bit about this .
so what are media today ?
and then you realize that it gave up a change .
but i &apos;ll just get to talk about that in a minute .
so , the power of information in information has been repor@@ ted since all the time .
sh@@ am@@ s , p@@ rie@@ sts , so-@@ to the knowledge of knowledge , were put in order to preser@@ ve knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still doing very , very strong stories today .
the auth@@ or of the al@@ em@@ s artist scan , jon@@ a@@ than got@@ sch@@ all , we still deliver every year for a year and a half hundred hours with the re@@ mu@@ ge@@ ing of stories .
this means for a child to reach the world &apos;s great@@ ness to the end of the animal year of his life with the re@@ cep@@ tion of stories .
now , we think our love of stories depen@@ ds on us as a child sitting on the la@@ p of our parents .
no , no , way a little .
this goes much further back into the cultures of pre-@@ industrial time .
but to me , in the context of inter@@ active media , as most impres@@ sive , that we &apos;ve awar@@ ded ab@@ ins in our biological memory , the ability to think of non@@ lin@@ e@@ ey .
so i &apos;ve brought you an example from the north american tri@@ be of the no@@ ot@@ ca@@ o stem .
and the lives lived in the co@@ ast@@ al area of british colum@@ bia .
and as you can see , this is a very in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent area , and you had to navi@@ gate from the island of the island to be an island in order to get food
and they did it with what they called the can@@ ad landscape .
that &apos;s what you probably know when you care about it a little bit about the austr@@ ali@@ an im@@ mana@@ gu@@ ties .
they &apos;ve got similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a le@@ ad map , but they use these sorts of ble@@ ach@@ ed nan@@ gl@@ ines or also ru@@ b@@ pl@@ ing levels .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y could be ma@@ pped out of the regi@@ ons of the regi@@ ons .
which was the language of repres@@ enting the language of sub@@ ordin@@ ation .
that is , you navi@@ g@@ ated about sound and about rhyth@@ m .
and those bla@@ des and this rhyth@@ m have repres@@ ented the ge@@ ology that &apos;s repres@@ ented by the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region , and that , of course , has allowed us to assem@@ ble and assem@@ ble and assem@@ ble it , and then could move back to the back of the stat@@ ement , to move back to the ex@@ act stat@@ ement .
why don &apos;t we ch@@ ari@@ ve to get from a point from a to b ?
anyway , not in order to navi@@ gate .
so , what has actually happened ?
and what happened is this is the sort of organic machine age .
we called ourselves a bird age before what we call the bird age .
so the machine happened , and what happened is the book , and what happened is this is the video oli@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
and that &apos;s what happened because we had the responsibility for our memor@@ ies , and that shif@@ ted the production of our individual memor@@ ies to ex@@ ternal media .
so on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we predi@@ cted a little bit of a bro@@ ad thing to virtu@@ alize .
virtu@@ ality &apos;s suddenly become stran@@ ger for us , and having nothing to do with reality .
bru@@ ce brown , a known design resear@@ cher at bri@@ gh@@ ton &apos;s study , is to say that these mass media , he &apos;s like , the book and the image , not the television , and so on , and so on , what we call the mass media today has fossi@@ li@@ zed our memor@@ ies and our ability to virtu@@ alize our ability to virtu@@ alize .
so , let &apos;s make a little deal .
it was from the mr@@ i age to the machine age .
what does our thinking of our thinking and our memor@@ ies for our thinking ?
and then the crimin@@ al ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments of the pre-@@ industrial cultures are .
and they are repor@@ ted throughout the cent@@ u@@ ries over the cent@@ u@@ ries and more over@@ all , through the const@@ it@@ u@@ tional const@@ it@@ u@@ tional const@@ it@@ ution .
that is , instead of remem@@ ber@@ ing us individu@@ ally , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , far , in general distribu@@ ted patterns of memor@@ ies in which we can dep@@ end on our personal memor@@ ies .
we are no longer producing ourselves .
we have an abstra@@ ct language in a more abstra@@ ct language .
we don &apos;t think about it anymore in pictures of these things , but we co@@ operate it to you all the time , and they co@@ ordin@@ ate our language .
we used to be used to that things happening lin@@ ear .
and we accep@@ ted lin@@ ear@@ ity as a leg@@ acy , and there are only ex@@ cep@@ tions , like the non-@@ lin@@ ear@@ ity of purpose .
the rest of us have sta@@ yed , it &apos;s the de@@ cre@@ ase .
now , we &apos;re still very , very intri@@ gu@@ ed as information training as a information engine .
so the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had this bird , we had the machine age , and we &apos;ve now described this so-@@ called the cy@@ ber age .
it sounds very , very conven@@ i@@ ently , and it sounds very science fi@@ ction , i know .
but these concep@@ ts of the cyber@@ age concep@@ ts , that will get us back to disco@@ vering what our skills are going to be .
it &apos;s about virtu@@ ality , it &apos;s about transpar@@ ent lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about illu@@ str@@ ari@@ um .
i want to explain that a minute a minute .
there &apos;s technical concep@@ ts like this , like aug@@ mented reality , which is the exten@@ ded reality .
so if you look at google glass for example , it &apos;s kind of a concept that makes us re@@ com@@ men@@ d the virtual world with the real world , which means virtual to percei@@ ve virtual , natural feeling , to feel virtual , natural , is accep@@ ted .
there &apos;s another example of what virtual reality described .
th@@ ying , of course , what i &apos;m talking about in the context of my talk is that we don &apos;t move in physical , virtual worl@@ ds , all the way to the poster picture of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ cks .
and other examples are the ambi@@ ents , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtu@@ ality as a real space space .
i &apos;ve got the degree , and i hope that the video is working , a very , very nice project , which is the b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s work from michael bur@@ k , or an@@ or@@ is , j@@ or@@ is &apos;s g@@ arb@@ age and j@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ al g@@ arb@@ age .
and those last decade , again , are here .
you might be able to stand up for a minute , so you can conver@@ t you to the conclu@@ sion with the two about the project .
and this project , as an example , i brought myself along as an example of how again add@@ res@@ sing this arch@@ a@@ ic , cognitive model .
the whole one is a game i &apos;ve got to say .
so , of course , what &apos;s extremely inti@@ mi@@ dat@@ ing with the de@@ c of course , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i &apos;m talking about computer play , you &apos;re very likely to be very likely to type around people in front of any con@@ cre@@ te or playing with some con@@ so@@ le in your hand with any one of
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in the middle .
this is a game that comes out .
and that &apos;s tar@@ ge@@ ted to me that i explor@@ ed the outside world , so i explor@@ ed the real world back again .
and this game conne@@ cts the virtual world , so the data that we create the data space that we create with the real world .
and i apo@@ logi@@ ze to you that i have to cut so hard .
now , you can explain that a lot better in the same way , because there &apos;s more more than that .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m disco@@ vering a city by looking at where positive has been dre@@ am@@ ed of or nega@@ tively dan@@ cing .
and so , i get a very different looking of view from the city , quite a different impres@@ sion , which is that i see negative and positive terri@@ tory of a city , and i &apos;ve enter@@ ed a very different , virtual map from a very real town .
and we can actually look at that now .
so , what you can see here is , sorry , there &apos;s another little explan@@ ation of what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this virtual world is alive in the walls of our cities , is clearly .
and with a kind of a back@@ back lam@@ p , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to sum@@ mar@@ ize that to my con@@ ception , and in the sense that the characteri@@ stics and the sk@@ ill that we &apos;ve been doing out of the bird age , that they &apos;ve gone out of the way that the cy@@ ber ner@@ vers and the skills that we &apos;ve been doing is re@@ duc@@ ed about complex , technologi@@ cal , new products , actually , not in the future , but actually to ki@@ ck back to our roots .
thank you very much .
yeah , i &apos;m really thri@@ ll@@ ed to be with you .
now , i &apos;ve just been asked whether this s@@ ack is a speak@@ er s@@ ack and mine is going to be speaking .
that &apos;s not going to do that .
and i &apos;m going to do the same thing as well , which is in there .
but still , i &apos;m going to do it a little bit curious .
yes , kids are made out of curi@@ osity or should be curi@@ ous , designers too .
now , i &apos;m a designer of house , so i &apos;m also concerned about the theme of curi@@ osity and how the curi@@ osity will again think of our thinking , and why don &apos;t we lose curi@@ osity and have to re@@ store it and come back and forth and so forth .
and this is a whole range of things that you think about as a function of what you &apos;re doing .
if profess@@ ors get curi@@ ously , they &apos;re often pus@@ hed into such al@@ mer@@ -@@ research se@@ me@@ sters .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half year .
a research se@@ me@@ ster to the top@@ ic interface is design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are these things going to be related to such natural , arch@@ a@@ ic jud@@ ges of communication , inter@@ actions , etc and so forth .
and i &apos;m holding one of these small devices up because things will always become more intui@@ tive , always natural , more inter@@ -@@ use friend@@ ly , and you &apos;ve got to look at what &apos;s , of course , , to us , of course , and what is ide@@ al or intui@@ tively .
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve been in the real@@ m of v@@ ener@@ -@@ func@@ tional interface , so the next generation around the community in which our tools or the computer of the calcul@@ ator changes the su@@ ck@@ c@@ essi@@ ve to the digital of the fol@@ ding to digital memor@@ i@@ ents .
so , i &apos;ve been enga@@ ged with what &apos;s natural or intui@@ tive .
may be a gli@@ mp@@ se of this .
why does this ever happen ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , we &apos;re now going to move forward from the third in the fourth community generation or community .
so , from modern to computer culture .
each company is im@@ pac@@ ted by a primary medium .
at the beginning , the tri@@ b@@ al society began with language .
that is , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked about a common language , you &apos;ve moved to each other , moved into the same ca@@ ve or into other areas , has developed cities or villa@@ ges , and it &apos;s sort of building cell society .
and the primary medium was the language , it was something very natural , something very living .
it has to be learning as well , so no child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning , of course , su@@ c@@ ch@@ essi@@ ve and de@@ fau@@ lt , of course .
this was then dis@@ per@@ sed by the ancient society and the first form of the abstra@@ ction .
this was at the time of a huge out@@ c@@ ry , because you , of course , started mani@@ pul@@ ating living language in the form of writing , which means what flu@@ id and alive is , i start and i manipu@@ late it in stone , and i manipu@@ late it as well .
depen@@ ding on me and when i pa@@ dd@@ le , it &apos;s of course a very different narra@@ tive than if it &apos;s alive , of course , than if it &apos;s alive .
but su@@ k@@ z@@ essi@@ ve was then this writing as a primary medium to be received .
then came the next generation , which is where we actually live high lives today .
this is the prin@@ ting press , and it &apos;s con@@ fin@@ ed with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
while it &apos;s been an ap@@ r@@ on@@ t , where a@@ del and no@@ er@@ us and others have been told : are they in@@ san@@ e when the people start to read , they want to talk about the after@@ wards , and that &apos;s , of course , totally f@@ at@@ al .
and now we &apos;re going to move to the next generation and the exciting thing , an gener@@ ative shift is just every few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomen@@ al phase that we &apos;re going to be doing this .
it &apos;s really conf@@ used for us , of course , because we &apos;re looking at the new media , develop social media , facebook and etc and so forth .
with the total transpar@@ ency , which is what the new think is , don &apos;t say that the las@@ ic horse and no bee@@ f is more , or other phenomen@@ a , i just want to sh@@ y this out , and i want to figure out what that is , and
and these two worl@@ ds of te@@ ans are just growing up , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing is , when you look at this , this new society , this computer society , is a lot of different mechanis@@ ms , principles and arch@@ a@@ gical thinking out of the tri@@ be of the stem society .
but it &apos;s no longer at the local level , but on a global level .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that the issue of ec@@ ology is a global economy .
not when i think here lo@@ cally , e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally thinking , and the neighb@@ or thinking less e@@ col@@ o@@ gical , then it &apos;s not going to work .
that means that , from local village , it &apos;s actually become a global village with the same principles , including , of course , extremely intui@@ tive , but also over@@ all transpar@@ ency .
as you know then in the village , who has what to do with who and when , this is what happens today beyond these mobile rate devices on a global scale , it &apos;s going to be global .
whether we know glob@@ ally we know glob@@ ations and faster and better acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating .
as it happened , i was going to be on the village before that .
now , before the background , i &apos;ve just been bus@@ y looking at this , which is , for us , what does it mean for us , which is , for us , also , instin@@ c@@ tively , but for us , also instin@@ c@@ tively , what makes the difference ?
because often , people don &apos;t come , they can &apos;t make use friend@@ ly so that anyone can hand@@ le it .
so , you &apos;ve got to think about what &apos;s happening , and not just changes it is that it &apos;s different , but it should also be better .
and whenever , of course , something intui@@ tive , and how can i take action as a cre@@ ator , and as a matter of fact , what i can do is make a design friend@@ ly , so they &apos;re intui@@ tively intui@@ tive because then they &apos;re making fun and they &apos;re easy to use .
you &apos;re still going to be enga@@ ged during studying , with the subject of perception and per@@ cep@@ tual psychology .
and of course , that &apos;s what you start looking and you &apos;re saying , ok , now , i &apos;m just looking inside the inner self .
and what &apos;s it like to be in there actually ?
so how do we do it when we look inside there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intui@@ tively , and how do we work our chan@@ n@@ els of perception , and how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs once said , you know , you &apos;re bus@@ y to sing metaphor &apos;s art@@ ma .
so you really have to look at the details when i want to make something a verb@@ al friend@@ ly or intui@@ tive exchange , what does that mean in the nu@@ cle@@ us .
and what you see is , you know , as a young species , most of us think we &apos;ve only got five , and now we &apos;ve already noticed seven , so far , there &apos;s still more meaning , but as exten@@ sion as we are exten@@ ding ourselves , as well .
and look , how process is we process information , how do we take information ?
so , what is information ? what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
a lot of people are using the word , but they don &apos;t know what it is that they pay .
but i have to understand , in the core , in nature , when information is becoming information , when from data , from data , i know how to make things intui@@ tively , i know how to make things intui@@ tively , but of course , i know how to make things more intui@@ tive .
and of course , how does design make sense of perception too .
we see this when i measure things , then i can make them conf@@ using like the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can sort of intui@@ tively make it intui@@ tive by showing things .
so , much more natural , in a ves@@ sel@@ s , but i &apos;m looking directly at where is s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er in there .
and when i say someone , i used to give me s@@ alt or pe@@ pp@@ er , and then he &apos;s going to get to work for the right first time where it &apos;s in there .
and just being intui@@ tive on the left , and then hopefully i &apos;m hop@@ ing that there &apos;s no sugar in it , which is s@@ alt , because it &apos;s indi@@ c@@ ant .
but also , our perception of ourselves , like dec@@ lar@@ ing us as well .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks larger than the small , although that &apos;s not the case , but yet our perception of it is so large , and yet our perception is constantly changing things on what kind of context we put in things .
anyone know what this is ?
w@@ on .
ze@@ on-@@ sharing should still work .
because that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be on my glas@@ ses rather than my glas@@ ses
so this is the circle of the circle .
a second circle is starting to cor@@ rel@@ ate or associ@@ ate some simil@@ ari@@ ties to it .
and now , if i take another hal@@ f-@@ do@@ e , then we don &apos;t even look at one particular organ , which is circle , circle and , but we &apos;re looking at an island , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , one circle , one circle , one cycle , one cycle .
this is what you call tou@@ ter@@ -@@ law or de@@ gest@@ ative psychology , which is also affec@@ ting us with perception as well .
it &apos;s important for the designers that are usually in the first se@@ me@@ ster , which is fab@@ ul@@ ous st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing laws .
gest@@ ure laws of clo@@ sh@@ es , em@@ bo@@ died laws of the continu@@ ity and so forth .
so often , in the third , they &apos;ve been for@@ gotten again .
but that &apos;s a essential compon@@ ent compon@@ ent , if you really want things to be particularly intui@@ tive , too , as well .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is also looking at vision .
sounds very tri@@ cky about this , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re going to engage with it .
so we &apos;re in front of the eyes , and now , you think , we &apos;re looking back at the very back .
this is fal@@ se .
you &apos;re looking forward at the back of the back .
and that &apos;s a pre@@ ten@@ ding to rec@@ ru@@ it , to see that you can see what it &apos;s going to recognize , which is a lot of grand circle .
that is , we only see our vision before we see it coming back into our se@@ e@@ p , to say , &quot; okay . &quot;
so i &apos;ve got cognitive re@@ connection , you have im@@ j@@ ated what you want to see .
and then that &apos;s where it comes back , comes back .
and then again , it goes forward , because the back of the back is not the front , and it says , &quot; look , it &apos;s really going to look at what you see , that &apos;s what you see , too , that &apos;s what you want to see
and then it goes back to the back , and then it turns out that &apos;s going to be seen .
so a very , very exciting process of running things out and what kind of milli@@ seconds of these things are happening and what &apos;s happening for a milli@@ -@@ kil@@
i don &apos;t know who one of you knows this picture .
right there is exactly the same thing that i described to you .
now , everybody from this pattern is trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who under@@ stands what &apos;s going to recognize .
does anybody see something about it ?
a d@@ al@@ ma@@ id , that &apos;s right .
if i &apos;ve seen this that there &apos;s a d@@ al@@ mati@@ ous in there , you know that .
you &apos;re never going to forget that , because i &apos;m going to show you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ ce@@ er is .
now you &apos;re going to see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ id .
and keep on , now , watch him .
that is , i actually dre@@ w her in the face of this now that you don &apos;t recognize any pattern anymore , but i con@@ vey them within time to see this dog in this pres@@ cri@@ ption image .
and this is this proje@@ ction of vision , re@@ plac@@ ement , vision .
now i know about it , and now i &apos;m going to pro@@ j@@ ute that i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ ce@@ er .
i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ ce@@ er .
so , very exciting processes that go into that , yeah , gra@@ y isn &apos;t actually , but here &apos;s a ra@@ va crowd right now in this ra@@ va crowd , very appar@@ ently .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
for long , yes .
so this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know a little bit about three seconds , until i sort of go out of the past loo@@ p , i can also bridge very well wait for the present loo@@ p that i &apos;m giving him by trying to do it for three seconds .
this has to be process@@ ed as a present .
and then it dri@@ ps into the past , and so i can bridge , for example , very elegan@@ t , for example , looking at the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what is la@@ der@@ ering 20 billion seconds ?
well , a milli@@ seconds .
it &apos;s also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period when you fall in love with that .
so that means , if you know this now , you &apos;ll pay attention to where you look like long , because i don &apos;t take any air@@ f@@ are on what it &apos;s going to happen for now .
and six milli@@ seconds , also , a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most of the per@@ cep@@ tions we have .
that means that this first impres@@ sion is happening in a very rapi@@ dly fast rate of how we percei@@ ve things .
and as we can also look at things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re sort of exten@@ ding ourselves against our environment , so that we can respond to that proper@@ ly .
now , of course , designers don &apos;t just change the issue of per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral process@@ ing or cognitive ser@@ gon@@ om@@ ics , but of course , pri@@ mar@@ ily , with human metaphor relationship .
so , how does a human work do with some of the objects ?
there &apos;s also a lot of practical fun@@ ctions of practical fun@@ ctions , so infor@@ mal@@ a@@ es@@ thetic aspe@@ cts , or for@@ mal@@ a@@ es@@ thetic aspe@@ cts .
there are sig@@ ns of fun@@ ces , where i know exactly where i need to go .
but there &apos;s symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , so why does anyone give for a little nap@@ k@@ in where they don &apos;t have anything inside , so hor@@ r@@ ying su@@ ms of money , even though it &apos;s not that much , that shape ?
we &apos;re more likely to be on the narra@@ tional level that we &apos;re doing as a designer , of course , as a designer .
back to my evolutionary top@@ ic , and the subject of which , of course , lies on top of it , is where it is .
and dig@@ ging always means , &quot; how can i quickly reach a certain goal or how can a user in a certain us@@ age context become effective , efficient and satis@@ fac@@ tion ? &quot;
this is what the nor@@ m says about this .
how can i make anything that &apos;s inten@@ sive friend@@ ly ?
can i get that directly , or do it , &quot; i need a man@@ ual or i need to do some of that .
and less us@@ able or partici@@ s@@ ual friend@@ ly is it .
but i don &apos;t think i make it differently , and it &apos;s more mana@@ ge@@ able , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better hand@@ -@@ thin@@ able .
you &apos;ve got to understand that too .
and if you look par@@ tly the software that we &apos;ve just seen before , you &apos;ll also understand why nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent of our software is little intui@@ tive , or not to be able to use the i@@ -@@ pad in many areas or i@@ -@@ phones , even though it &apos;s much more intui@@ tive than classi@@ c software .
this is not until that &apos;s intui@@ tive , not only since apple is a fundamental economic factor , a fundamental success of success , if i really want to use technologi@@ cal devices to people .
so why ?
because that &apos;s where we usually treat this new kind of us@@ ality , which is the natural user supply , for instance , on average for five times the average level of our
you &apos;ve got to imagine , if you &apos;re going to make something of the classi@@ c , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software just one hour or so .
that doesn &apos;t mean that it will probably go for four hours more than you can go home , but your emplo@@ y@@ ment , or whatever you want to do , is to spend whatever it is for the four hours or so .
now , i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s an im@@ men@@ se capacity to make certain things happen for us , that
if we put ourselves back into the real@@ m of software , here &apos;s the first machine and fron@@ ter-@@ line inter@@ faces , which were very abstra@@ ct where you &apos;ve taken months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing came out of now with the ne@@ at neu@@ ral model or mental model like the software e@@ er@@ bi@@ ans have worked , that you would have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor of a des@@ k@@ top to make use of the computer .
so , no longer that zer@@ o@@ es and ones or cr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but i &apos;m looking at a metaphor .
now , this made it a lot more us@@ -@@ friend@@ ly , but it &apos;s also much better than that , of course .
and so the next generation of graphi@@ cal associ@@ ations are already working on a lot more with behavior .
and so , as a form of subje@@ cts , i actually made a lot more frequ@@ ent behavior than what i look like .
and this is also a paradig@@ m shift .
and all of a sudden , i always look at the success of success , just the beginning of the des@@ s@@ essi@@ ons .
and then , if i go one step further into this us@@ -@@ user inter@@ faces , where i talk about a voice , with language , by touch , with gest@@ ure , and no longer to control things with mouse and cur@@ sor@@ s , then i &apos;m even faster and even more suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently .
but that brings me back to the point , when things are actually more intui@@ tive to this point , to the point .
now , if you get more intui@@ tive , and then i &apos;ve got to get back to my little friend here and see , what does that mean for a point of cognitive ser@@ gon@@ ie , when is it really , when is it really intui@@ tive , when is it really intui@@ tive ?
and this is always a little bit more intui@@ tive to us than , if i don &apos;t have to think about it a little bit .
so he doesn &apos;t really want to think , but it &apos;s just a simple thing to think about .
so the less i &apos;m sort of thinking about it , the more intui@@ tive it is .
and what does that mean for the designer ?
so , when we look at how we can trans@@ late exi@@ sting action models from one another , for example , the metaphor , then i can make the use as a form of form .
that is , i can just trans@@ mit an intui@@ tive , human action model on a software , so that software will make a lot more use more friend@@ ly .
so , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the most intui@@ tive app@@ lic@@ ation of us of human beings , and now i &apos;m going to tell you .
this is what &apos;s called the o@@ s@@ se-@@ model model .
it &apos;s using each of us , and it &apos;s an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m , and it &apos;s an ori@@ r@@ ony@@ m , sel@@ ec@@ tive , in@@ form , trans@@ form , trans@@ formed , trans@@ formed .
it makes any of you all the time , but it makes it un@@ consci@@ ously and it &apos;s somehow intui@@ tive or it &apos;s instin@@ c@@ tively instin@@ ctive
the model is coming out of the wom@@ b and is inter@@ cultural , so it &apos;s working glob@@ ally and old , and it &apos;s going to be used all the time , without most people even knew that this model is present .
o@@ cell@@ o@@ str@@ a will be around 50 to 17 times each of us , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve discovered that it &apos;s less often stra@@ tting less often than a day .
and i can now try to sel@@ ec@@ tively sel@@ ec@@ te this mental action model , sel@@ ec@@ tive , trans@@ fer@@ ring , trans@@ late to an inter@@ struc@@ tional system .
and through that kind of trans@@ mission , kind of like with the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , but it &apos;s no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a celebra@@ tion , of a management line .
and this is on a higher gra@@ ct of the associ@@ ation of the use of the use of a classi@@ c metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top of the des@@ k@@ top .
and when i &apos;m past that now , for example , i &apos;m controll@@ ing as a tran@@ scen@@ dent , sel@@ ec@@ tive as choices , i can look at it in the details , and i can take it on the details , and i can also throw it somewhere , or i can shop or shop , and i can buy it , and so on .
and then i can trans@@ late this whole thing .
i &apos;m going to try to give you a sense of a picture .
just everybody &apos;s e@@ aten a ca@@ ke , yeah .
temp@@ t : now , i &apos;m actually inter@@ acting with the object , so i can zo@@ om out , zo@@ om in .
i &apos;ll get over@@ looked , can now be up on the fil@@ ters and say , just show me all of the cho@@ col@@ ate points for example .
and at once , a interface has been much more intui@@ tive and much more natural .
because i can pick up things like this , and i can touch them , and they come towards me , is far more natural than if you can talk about hier@@ arch@@ ical web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms , sort of , sort of , able to make these things available .
shows is more american than thir@@ fe , and with that inten@@ tion , i want to be able to think about giving a , a and again to get to new solutions , and in that same sense , i &apos;m going to make you quite th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly for your attention and ask .
and i want to give you a very particular aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a young child , you &apos;ve got to take care of what ex@@ pul@@ sion you &apos;ve got , yes ? and depen@@ ding on whether your parents allow them to play more or less in the po@@ ckets , the more , the curi@@ osity will , of course , get on top of it , and then , of course
and the curi@@ osity doesn &apos;t learn .
so those are all the ones that are here and curi@@ osity , indeed , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about , you know , this whole environmental debate , global resol@@ ution , of clu@@ b &apos;s point , to make in quality , to imple@@ ment that in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point on that .
and it &apos;s han@@ ging on phosp@@ hor@@ us .
come , pe@@ e a chance .
every single day , they give rise to about two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and every day they have to pick two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us every day .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth else .
they can &apos;t store power .
they can &apos;t have b@@ ones .
we could just flo@@ at as am@@ or@@ p@@ o &apos;s m@@ old through the world &apos;s ocean .
if we don &apos;t take any of the phosp@@ hor@@ us and leave it off .
and the ama@@ z@@ ingly , we &apos;re here , we &apos;re talking about what &apos;s actually going on , which is actually not that way , but it &apos;s
because everyone &apos;s talking about energy , but no one &apos;s talking about the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is a lot of critical .
we dep@@ end on two of these countries .
we &apos;ve only got for two years of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and already now , through the phosp@@ hor@@ us building glob@@ ally , we &apos;ve brought a lot more ur@@ ani@@ um into the environment than in all the nuclear facili@@ ties .
in the last 20 years alone , fif@@ te@@ en thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ um have been de@@ dic@@ ated in our fields .
and that &apos;s how we take it all up .
it &apos;s making leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
and we think that we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less har@@ m@@ ful .
so , for instance , the environment , the environment , he &apos;s getting less car .
sho@@ ck the environment , make less waste .
but don &apos;t give the environment , dis@@ le@@ ading less energy .
but that &apos;s no protection .
that &apos;s like , as if i would say , lock your child , it &apos;s only three times instead of five times .
it &apos;s just a little less redu@@ ction .
if we think about it from the familiar to ba@@ g@@ ry , our whole earth will be once or later a ce@@ me@@ tr@@ al .
because that &apos;s about thinking about something about their feet .
and the most important thing here is to look at the soil , first of all .
there &apos;s over six percent of the carbon that &apos;s stor@@ ed in the ground .
right now we &apos;re building cor@@ n , and we lose between 11 and thir@@ ty kil@@ ogra@@ ms per he@@ ct@@ are , or 30 kil@@ ogra@@ ms of a he@@ ct@@ are , can also compu@@ te on the square meter .
that is , we lose about five times more than being gro@@ unded by being gro@@ unded .
now , we can actually look at the waste problem of course .
and everything is pac@@ ka@@ ged or a di@@ ver .
for example , in open b@@ ones , for example , at the home of the home , 20 percent of the oil oil sp@@ inner are wind@@ lin@@ ed .
and as we get older , the wind@@ n@@ esses are going to grow larger .
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the bre@@ ast@@ way .
hu@@ h ?
a baby will take about six thousand vie@@ ws .
we could cut that for gran@@ ted , of course , but what does that do ?
this is bal@@ e-@@ bal@@ an@@ ced in china in a second .
it &apos;s totally in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent .
so the question is , how are we going to deal with these mou@@ ths around ?
so , one of the evidence here is that men are not pig@@ s .
i want to tell you that .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is de@@ dic@@ ated to the pi@@ cks of the const@@ ant components of ex@@ cre@@ es .
most of the people about ur@@ ine .
there is .
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s so that men can &apos;t be pig@@
because that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been doing , isn &apos;t it ?
tradition@@ ally , we think about environmental debate , we &apos;re too many around the world .
and if you talk about the people that if you talk to people , if you say it &apos;s better , you &apos;re not there , then they become more sophisti@@ cated and ho@@ sti@@ le .
and so , somebody like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es says , there &apos;s nothing important than stabili@@ zing the human population .
in israel , you say , when you &apos;re reading a human life , you &apos;re going to see the earth .
and here it says , the more you to@@ ss , the better you turn .
there is .
so the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants will wei@@ gh about four times more than we do .
and i could also take ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the united states no one li@@ kes to be ac@@ tr@@ ated , in that far , although they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ arian .
that means that ants wei@@ gh@@ s a lot more than us .
and because they &apos;re physi@@ cally far harder than we and because they &apos;re only going to live for three to six months , they dis@@ agree in their weight , in the energy use of a hundred billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , so we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far we are away from what we really wanted and could be , for example , on earth , you can see , for example , there &apos;s a program to be able to see , for example , to 20 40 , you want to be here , for example , in the climate man@@ tra@@ l , right ?
you can only be fl@@ mal@@ l if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
it &apos;s the only way .
have you ever seen a climate bibli@@ tra@@ l tree ?
hu@@ h ?
one ? ?
that is , our whole intelligence is that we want to be dun@@ es than trees , right ?
hu@@ h ?
no tree is a carbon neu@@ tra@@ l .
th@@ ank@@ fully , yes ?
there &apos;s no over@@ population about trees in trees .
there are still six billion trees alone in the ama@@ zon area .
have you ever heard of over@@ population problems of trees before ?
that is , all of our intelligence means that we want to be dun@@ es as trees .
and where you see , even at something like de@@ meter , the most stri@@ king bio@@ - -- agriculture agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c products to go back .
every year we lose so three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us that actually have to go back in cir@@ tra@@ ct tra@@ ins .
and that &apos;s too many of that .
just on top of this .
that means we feel as gu@@ il@@ ty on earth that we say that there &apos;s no bio@@ ground , there &apos;s no bi@@ ol@@ and , no standard pro@@ gr@@ ession , and as you all can say , it allows us to go back to our own ex@@ cre@@ es .
isn &apos;t that un@@ comfortable ?
that &apos;s too many of that .
that makes sense to be less har@@ m@@ ful about what &apos;s caus@@ ing oil use .
now , where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but it &apos;s also about having a huge foot@@ print that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for econom@@ ies , but when it comes to the environment , is the ulti@@ mate , not to be there , yes ?
nu@@ g@@ le@@ mis@@ ts , yes ?
you can only have nu@@ g@@ le@@ cation , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you were sho@@ ot@@ ing , they would have been emissions .
so , you can &apos;t fix this .
we can do it differently .
we can extra@@ ct our nutri@@ ents back .
we make agriculture in brazil agriculture where we re@@ cover the nutri@@ ents .
at the very least , we can get back to that kind of nutri@@ tion in agriculture .
so we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking directly off from that .
in china , a da@@ tt@@ op@@ f today means hon@@ e@@ y@@ ho@@ th@@ ts , or some way , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too du@@ m@@ b to get our nutri@@ ents back .
that is , the whole western civili@@ zations story , it turns out the city was always la@@ id down , but the farmers never la@@ sted to the farmers .
so the cities would grow more and more , because the farmers were going to the cities , and the cities continu@@ ed to get their nutri@@ ents away away .
that &apos;s why all the western fe@@ atures are always exp@@ and@@ ing until they have not done the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re im@@ pac@@ ted .
hu@@ h ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done fra@@ c@@ tious civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get back to the nutri@@ ents .
even today , when you &apos;re invited to lunch in china , you &apos;re expe@@ cting to stay for food until you &apos;re looking up the toi@@ let .
because it &apos;s kind of un@@ friend@@ ly , walking and fe@@ eding nutri@@ ents .
you &apos;ve invited them to lunch , not for supp@@ le@@ ment , for supp@@ le@@ ment .
that is , you can see on the internet where you can re@@ gain nutri@@ ents .
and that &apos;s a nice thing to do when you do that , which is agriculture , bi@@ og@@ as , on a he@@ ct@@ are of about five thousand dollars in fa@@ vel@@ as , can wait for a farmer of about one-@@ 20@@ -@@ 100 dollars , and they &apos;re waiting with it , chi@@ ck@@ ens and pi@@ cks and vege@@ tables and fis@@ her@@ ies and fish .
and the great thing is that the crimin@@ al rates in the fa@@ vel@@ as will go over nine percent of the percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be very bad at just a little bit bad
we can support them , we can support them .
and this is , of course , high-@@ tech agriculture , but these facili@@ ties are self-@@ using themselves .
and the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re created this way by design that buil@@ ds a farmer they can simply ac@@ late .
that is , the crimin@@ al rates go back to the end .
and none of these facili@@ ties , we &apos;ve now built over 100 years of being built over the last 20 years , none of these facili@@ ties has ever been s@@ las@@ hed .
you could just throw out a li@@ t al@@ l@@ l so easily , and then it would be ru@@ ined for years for years .
don &apos;t find it .
that is , we don &apos;t have to control people , just to be a little bad .
we can support them , we can support them .
that is , we need to get back to phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , they &apos;re best ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed in germany , in germany , in fr@@ ance , in fr@@ ance .
unfortunately , they don &apos;t appear in the clou@@ ds , but maybe you can help the fr@@ ance a little bit .
because the m@@ essen@@ tic facili@@ ty could best re@@ w@@ end the phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and it has to go back .
this is what we &apos;re seeing is that phosp@@ hor@@ us is really critical .
and we can see that it &apos;s all done .
we &apos;ve used now in h@@ oll@@ and for three years now .
the du@@ tch government has expla@@ ined to us that they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is w@@ inning the phosp@@ hor@@ us .
but we need that over@@ all .
you know , there are two countries that are going to control almost 70 percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us reser@@ ve worldwide .
there &apos;s a bunch of or@@ e@@ c that &apos;s a bunch of or@@ phan@@ ages .
these are si@@ x-@@ 7@@ 0-@@ 70 countries control 40 percent of the oil supply .
and the oil will replace us through other energy car@@ ri@@ ers .
but the phosp@@ hor@@ us is not able to replace .
and that &apos;s not about making the evidence a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and i think , above all , is to ask what the right thing is .
that is to say , it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in h@@ oll@@ and , of course , it &apos;s easier to understand , because in h@@ oll@@ and , the land is built on flo@@ wers .
hu@@ h ?
so , imagine if for instance , if you want your wife to be sad , if you have fri@@ gh@@ ted you , and you come in with fif@@ ty ro@@ ses .
completely in@@ efficient .
but , really , absolutely effective , is it ?
or take a li@@ pp@@ al pen .
a woman is eating about six com@@ ma three kil@@ ogra@@ ms of their lifetime in their lifetime .
there it is .
it &apos;s not scienti@@ fically accu@@ rate , because we don &apos;t know how much away it gets k@@ is@@ sed .
but a li@@ p pen , even in this light light , can i tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but it &apos;s all effective , right ?
anything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not about resource efficiency , it &apos;s not about efficiency .
asking , what is the right thing ?
now , not to burn a little bit better , and do it a little bit better and to lose it and use that whole material for cir@@ cular tra@@ ins , but first to ask , how do you inclu@@ de circu@@ it@@ ry ?
think of mo@@ z@@ art efficiency .
hu@@ h ?
if i invi@@ te you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tab@@ le@@ tte with open taste and a glass of water to it .
gor@@ ge@@ ous , hu@@ h ?
this is efficiency .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , effici@@ ently ?
hu@@ h ?
that is , the whole thing that coun@@ ts in life is not about avo@@ i@@ ding , redu@@ cing , re@@ duc@@ ing .
all the environmental debate .
we say to people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have environmental consciousness in the south .
no , that &apos;s the right thing to throw away , right ?
at every location where you &apos;re thro@@ wn away , from , yes , you create life again .
but the wrong things are .
if you pull the wrong things away , you have a g@@ arb@@ age problem .
in the way we think about north .
there &apos;s all the foot@@ print behind this place .
if you run , yes , every foot@@ print re@@ co@@ vers to the floor .
because the ground just gets the mo@@ s@@ ese away and the wind and the water was@@ hes the soil away .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , any foot@@ print means that the water rema@@ ins longer in the co@@ ok .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large foot@@ print that &apos;s going to be a we@@ t@@ land .
not gu@@ il@@ t management .
we say in germany , sustain@@ ability .
hu@@ h ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife with your wife ?
what do you say then ?
it &apos;s sustainable .
and then i say , heart fi@@ gi@@ d , yes ?
and that &apos;s just the minim@@ um .
so , don &apos;t save , waste , avoid .
every waste there &apos;s nutri@@ ent .
and it &apos;s a l@@ um@@ p if you look in it@@ al@@ y , as people in the high bo@@ w make was@@ h@@ bo@@ ese out of the car so that &apos;s what they call the car .
because , you know , it &apos;s a funny process .
it &apos;s a form of re@@ tin@@ -@@ behavior , ok ?
you can show me , i was there .
but with the cor@@ rect design , there &apos;s a great one .
for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice cl@@ oth pac@@ ka@@ ge , which is flu@@ id at room temperature .
they can throw them away where they go and they stand .
in two hours , it &apos;s exp@@ and@@ ing everywhere .
and it con@@ tains see@@ ds of rare plants so that it can take you away with the bio@@ diversity of bio@@ diversity .
that is , we &apos;re valuable , not har@@ m@@ ful .
so , there are two cir@@ cular cir@@ cles .
now , not all of us are going to be com@@ post@@ able .
a television or a was@@ hing machine , and they only use it , they don &apos;t use it .
it &apos;s just the things that are de@@ dic@@ ated , like sho@@ ot@@ as , like ru@@ b@@ ch@@ ys , like car ta@@ pes , they have to be so they &apos;re going to be in biological systems .
the things that are just being used are going to go into technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
hu@@ h ?
for example , the s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yes ?
in the direct ad , it &apos;s not for the company pu@@ ma per company , but for that you now help this company to success@@ fully make these products .
because we don &apos;t really do all the things that are fre@@ ely free .
hu@@ h ?
so , if i invi@@ te you invi@@ ting and say , &quot; it &apos;s free of ye@@ ats , it doesn &apos;t help to you .
no , we deter@@ mine what &apos;s in it .
posi@@ tive .
so it &apos;s not like de@@ to@@ x .
not tox@@ ic in the middle .
it &apos;s useful , everything that &apos;s in it .
these are the first shoes that you can put out the ca@@ v@@ ali@@ r at the foot@@ board , and go to the ru@@ b@@ ble in organic cir@@ cles , right ?
all of this is com@@ post@@ able from that .
and as we succe@@ ed , of course , for ko@@ das , for z@@ nes and with mau@@ ri@@ tz and all the tex@@ ti@@ le industry , there &apos;s all kinds of tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
and that &apos;s half the de@@ fle@@ cted problems in the world that are being caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industri@@ es .
and that &apos;s why you help people , ask people .
hey , pu@@ ma , are you really serious about being serious ?
because they &apos;ve already moved twice the board of cha@@ ir@@ age .
and i &apos;m not sure that they really don &apos;t go to dinner .
so , just help me with a little bit of it .
but it can be done .
there is .
this is what &apos;s been repres@@ ented .
this is going to happen .
now , we can make these things now that if they b@@ low down , they can be in biological cir@@ cular cir@@ cles .
so , technical cir@@ cl@@ atory circu@@ its are the same .
there is a direct system of re@@ calcul@@ ation for this .
this is the first e@@ col@@ o@@ ck ru@@ ck@@ s@@ ack , actually , which is made for it to go back to the cycle .
so , again , in every store , you can get things back .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the wave wi@@ sh@@ es ?
if there is right now , the tr@@ ash is .
and everywhere these are all the ti@@ les around , almost .
in the countries where people are coming to money .
there go to the el@@ ev@@ ator , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change water stor@@ age , in the inside , they &apos;ll be able to go back to cell@@ u@@ lock , with a baby in israel , or in tun@@ isi@@ a , hundreds of miles of trees .
hu@@ h ?
just when you take that wind , it cr@@ us@@ hes , ster@@ ili@@ zing , ster@@ ing the pul@@ der to plant trees .
and with that , the baby is positive for all of life , has been on the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need cen@@ mal@@ eu@@ tra@@ l , we can be positive positive .
it &apos;s kind of like an explor@@ tical po@@ tation .
yeah , so sort of .
hu@@ h ?
this is what we can do .
we can rein@@ vent everything that &apos;s even more .
i set up an institute of this .
mean@@ while , there are lots and lots of people working there , and they can all be enga@@ ged .
there &apos;s pro@@ pos@@ al to com@@ pose , cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le , where everyone can join .
so no longer to save , de@@ ar , avoid , re@@ duc@@ ing , no training management , but intelligent waste .
does it be curious ?
thank you very much .
the job of interpre@@ ts .
music as a language .
in descri@@ bing the descri@@ ption of my talk , i wrote that i am an interpre@@ ter , myself , as a transl@@ ator , so in english , right ?
now , interpre@@ ts are repor@@ ters written by written notes in class .
that , as a transl@@ ator , as a transl@@ ator , you don &apos;t just trans@@ late the text into a different language , but you have to understand the deeper meaning of words and the mean meaning of words to make it a meaning@@ ful trans@@ lation , and it knows anybody who &apos;s to do it with foreign languages .
already , from ger@@ man to trans@@ late into english , you can ask more knowledge , if you think about poetry , or whatever you &apos;re about about poetry .
but it &apos;s very strange for sel@@ ec@@ ting what we do with our music language .
as a pres@@ entation of a piece of music , i first saw the written notes .
you think that the compon@@ ent is put into the notes exactly everything in the notes , which he has re@@ vis@@ ed .
in fact , the notes are very va@@ gue and in@@ conven@@ i@@ ence .
and these notes are kind of just as accu@@ rate or in@@ accu@@ rate , as well as a verb@@ al , if very seem@@ ingly , pen@@ e@@ ous , descri@@ p@@ cy of a landscape .
because in this verb@@ al landscape , the thro@@ wing of the flo@@ wer doesn &apos;t smell , the level of the ice just to ac@@ qui@@ re , not to hear the mar@@ ks of the wind , not to touch the mar@@ g@@ ins of the wind .
that means that interpre@@ ts has to trans@@ late these dis@@ cla@@ und@@ ers of not@@ al speech into another , nam@@ ely , con@@ cre@@ te , non@@ verb@@ al music language .
today , i want to share with you what i call other musical out@@ put , so interpre@@ ts , again , transl@@ ating into a verb@@ al language .
so it &apos;s also a trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
so for me , i pre@@ fer to do this in ger@@ man , because if i had to trans@@ late it into english , it would be equivalent to me with trans@@ lation of the trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
so , these , the music works for me as much as the spo@@ ken language .
the no@@ ech@@ ted notes , in the process , have a writing of the letters of a
so it &apos;s not enough to read just signals and to push the keys on top of the piano or the right place on a grain of a grain .
so that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of letters you recognize when you get the language to it .
so , for the learning process of music , music language is at least as long as for the spo@@ ken language .
there &apos;s also gradu@@ ations , whether you &apos;re learning it to be passi@@ ve , understanding or you can speak for the musical na@@ tive speak@@ er to the musical na@@ tive speak@@ er
and the work of interpre@@ ts starts as much as the one of the the@@ es@@ pe@@ an re@@ vie@@ ws .
and after you start looking at a piece of cho@@ p , because you &apos;re excited about this , you first start explor@@ ing about the emergen@@ ce of com@@ position , right ?
you accu@@ mu@@ late information about the piece in the second phase of the second liter@@ ature .
you read in your letters , your bo@@ y@@ bo@@ ards , you notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of com@@ pos@@ ers themselves .
you &apos;re explor@@ ing the work that he &apos;s com@@ posed before and after@@ wards .
you compare compar@@ ison to that .
it &apos;s the kind of motivation of writing it .
and how did he think ?
what were the circum@@ stances of the society and the politics and the politics ?
all of this is interested in me .
you think in that time , by example , by looking at con@@ temporary pictures or liter@@ ature , you can look at con@@ temporary images .
but over time , you still have a kind of rich knowledge of a com@@ pos@@ er about com@@ pos@@ ers that you &apos;re playing , and it doesn &apos;t make any easier to think and feel in it and feel it .
the combin@@ ation is getting more and more to the bo@@ y@@ friend with which one is working together .
his desire to write the piece is getting more and more and more to my personal business to play it .
there &apos;s no other record of the com@@ pos@@ er as a com@@ pos@@ er of the com@@ pos@@ er , but just a frame@@ work , and i now change this frame@@ work to make sense and meaning with meaning and meaning .
so i &apos;ll say to my own words , what could be written between this sc@@ aff@@ old ?
i &apos;m going to play what those sound might have to know .
now for me and for the com@@ pos@@ er , and what you might think of today is what you now mean today .
every note , every phr@@ ase gets a sense of meaning , because i think it &apos;s coming out of my own , because it &apos;s a common sch@@ ol@@ ar from me now .
it &apos;s got to be a stand@@ mi@@ g for me in here today , and i can &apos;t convince my audience that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s a very fortun@@ ate conc@@ ert over and over again , if i may have experiences , the bit that i &apos;ve been doing so long in ad@@ v@@ ance of how to experience how to live .
how to experience a happy new day , even though the same ritu@@ als of life , rise to the same ritu@@ als , go up , to work , to work , to work , i &apos;ll make the same thing again and again on the other .
i &apos;ve become older again that brea@@ ks seas@@ ons , and my sp@@ ine is slo@@ wer at the end of the day , in a conc@@ ert room , it takes a chance for me to get the sound back at home than at home .
i take the brea@@ thing of the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
so all of this influence me , and all of this creates my experience with com@@ position , too .
but the most amazing thing is , if i stand with a du@@ o partner on the stage , and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
and then the same thing happens in a good , al@@ ous@@ ed conversation .
you bring into a new idea , and you &apos;re going to answer these answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we haven &apos;t mis@@ sed so , and what you can &apos;t be sam@@ pl@@ ed with .
and it &apos;s really fun to make music in this way , and you as the audience then experienced how the music communic@@ ates to life .
and so each conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this , like this moment .
and i can &apos;t play this way today in tw@@ ent@@ y years .
i &apos;m going to have more life lessons than i &apos;m going to do today , and therefore i &apos;m going to have a lot more of colors , a lot more of paint and emotion than we are today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a few colors of f@@ ou@@ kl@@ es out there , but i get some new time to get there .
there &apos;s a nice con@@ cre@@ te example of that .
it was on a piano instal@@ la@@ ce for music students with my belo@@ ved old teachers , professor j@@ ank@@ ers , a famous bee@@ tho@@ ven speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist and per@@ formed professor of music here in stu@@ ba g@@ art here .
sa@@ dly , i was left too much too young , so that it was already happening when i finally began to study .
but i was fortun@@ ate enough to meet him very early , 13 te@@ en years , and i was in my clas@@ ses at the time that i was on his school time .
i was 17 at the time when i was doing one of the clas@@ ses , and i played the last of the four bal@@ re@@ ents of ch@@ op@@ in , which was a head@@ work .
he wonder@@ ed what the in@@ struc@@ tion@@ ation of this mouth was for me .
this is one of these regi@@ struc@@ ting .
and in my you@@ th , i said , &quot; expec@@ tation . &quot;
there was s@@ wee@@ ping he , and he said , like this ?
that &apos;s got to be the age of aging .
because for me , she means memory .
it &apos;s been over six@@ ties .
well , with 17 , you still have dreams , but you don &apos;t memor@@ ally memor@@ ies .
so i want to play the play every few years , and it &apos;s changed for me every few years , even though no one has changed a single note .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because over and over again , i &apos;m going to read a new thing .
an example of it from a very different volu@@ me : mon@@ et pain@@ ted the se@@ ero@@ os of x .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in many hours of da@@ y@@ time , in various light .
he over@@ le@@ el@@ ed the lat@@ ero@@ tic shape , as he saw it , just like you were looking at him at that moment .
his personal impres@@ sions of the re@@ a@@ vor@@ y .
the x-@@ -@@ hour interpretation of a piece , it &apos;s this compar@@ able .
mean@@ while , i &apos;m alive as a ch@@ op@@ in for two-@@ thir@@ ds of years when he wrote the song .
he &apos;s only lived for fishing , he &apos;s only lived .
and it &apos;s important to look down again in the gra@@ des , even if i can tell you how to explo@@ it it .
to prevent the subject , directly with the com@@ pos@@ er .
because the notes are the only connection to him right now .
first of all , if it died .
now , how do you begin to talk about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need it for about as long as the spo@@ ken language .
often , the music class is so , you &apos;re learning to read the notes .
you basically learn to read this first before you just talk about one word .
you learn to find the notes to the gra@@ des on the instrument .
and then , when all the fing@@ ers and just as it is in the notes , they come out of the notes , sounds like sound come together , that sound like music .
when the er@@ ror is happening , the student gets it to be the next difficult thing .
we &apos;ve never spo@@ tt@@ ed about interpretation in the beginning of a beginn@@ ery .
well , there it is at the front of the front , which is a fast piece .
whe@@ in , slow .
l@@ oud and clo@@ th@@ es , f and b , et , etc .
that &apos;s what most of us know here .
but even if you take these fur@@ ra@@ tions , there &apos;s still a little bit of technical stuff .
and yet , it &apos;s not an interpretation .
i wonder to myself .
i wonder that you often forget something very element@@ ary .
nam@@ ely , to make music on the instrument that make your music and feel it should be there before .
because that &apos;s what sing@@ ing .
a kid who doesn &apos;t learn that sing@@ ing because it hasn &apos;t done the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it by themselves either .
it &apos;s like having a talk in the talk .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music , and then it &apos;s about another way of making a bla@@ ce of a sound .
people who have never condu@@ cted have never felt inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously with their own body , what it &apos;s like to make a sound .
to try and make a target with your own breath .
the music health activ@@ ment is the exten@@ sion of our bodies .
to sing our wee@@ ds , our hands and our feet to dance .
so the ham@@ ts@@ heads are in the piano , the sequ@@ el of my fing@@ ers .
the mel@@ o@@ dy comes from the pe@@ al and the rhyth@@ m out of the dance .
the conven@@ tional lec@@ ture today is not pre@@ cur@@ ur@@ able today .
you don &apos;t need to be able to make music any more if it &apos;s bor@@ ing .
you don &apos;t need to whi@@ st@@ le or sing a lim@@ b .
every music will be made , if you &apos;re constantly blo@@ wn away from the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing with it ?
and i &apos;m asking you , can you not sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they don &apos;t learn to sing@@ ing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to find out whether or not you can , or learn how to , these little mus@@ cles that represent the vo@@ zz@@ s , right .
and you can train that .
or c , because they &apos;ve com@@ posed to them that they &apos;re im@@ tra@@ cted .
and i ask you , how meaning@@ ful compe@@ t@@ ful was this diagno@@ sis ?
have you ever got a second opini@@ on or a third opini@@ on , how do you say it &apos;s nice today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to have ni@@ x as well .
now , what i was going to re@@ mind you of is because music is a beautiful , commun@@ al thing .
but maybe you still think of it as well .
well , so you can see , at all , no one has to be a th@@ ou@@ ni@@ c can@@ di@@ date .
but don &apos;t say , please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand classi@@ cal music .
i can &apos;t say , whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i said , &quot; but sur@@ ely can you like whether or not you like it . &quot;
because i don &apos;t think anybody knows , i don &apos;t know if i can taste , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so , they don &apos;t have to eat , just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so you also don &apos;t have to get rid of classi@@ cal music because it doesn &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consci@@ ously , and you say , &quot; well , if you taste it or not .
whether or not the music is ta@@ sting you or it &apos;s too c@@ ute .
you know what you feel .
over time , they get con@@ sent and they want to have a little bit more off@@ ices there , or even taste a little bit of differ@@ enti@@ al differences .
so why am i de@@ for@@ ed@@ ating from my audience , that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language and a language is there for communic@@ ations .
a piece of art@@ work that you never look at has no power to act .
the food that &apos;s been co@@ cked by a co@@ in or a che@@ f has to eat , and not only tra@@ vels out or hand@@ led out the reci@@ pes .
so listen , please , when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice no@@ is@@ y po@@ cket .
if there is in a context where the adults are doing edu@@ cational music or at least active music , a child gro@@ ws up , so it &apos;s easy for a music teacher to ask what color is your flo@@ wer ?
now , can you play me in the blue today ?
and the kid is playing , after a memor@@ ial , instead of having a red flo@@ wer , it &apos;s now a blue flo@@ wer
and this sounds very different from before .
and that was the very first beginning of a own musical stat@@ ement .
so , the first step to interpre@@ t .
and what if you played a piece today , which is origin@@ ally written a hundred , two decades ago or two , or three hundred years ago ?
mean@@ while , the instru@@ ments have continu@@ ed to evol@@ ve .
there have been no piano at the time as an instrument of the instrument .
it just wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the stream would be thri@@ ll@@ ed if he hadn &apos;t had the sound of modern publi@@ v@@ ators in today &apos;s publi@@ v@@ ings .
i can no@@ wa@@ day no@@ wa@@ days the sound that the stream had had on the stream of the stream to sound what a b@@ aro@@ ky c@@ em@@ bal@@ o can &apos;t do .
you know , even by bee@@ tho@@ ven , you know that he heard more than he had become dea@@ f .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a can be able to play everything , which is an orche@@ str@@ a at the time as a m@@ ess , at the beginning .
so the com@@ pos@@ ers are the com@@ pos@@ ers on us that will rein@@ vent the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be visible , which they &apos;ve only re@@ gar@@ ded only in the mind .
and also , what you would think about in the mind today .
or what i &apos;m consi@@ der@@ ing today is because what you might have thought about .
thank you very much .
do you know what ris@@ d is ?
have you ever been any alien ?
and what did that feel like ?
com@@ pla@@ in .
i have a friend , who &apos;s driving a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
and as i come back , with my little v w pi@@ es@@ el , and i &apos;m standing here , this sen@@ sation comes up .
i sho@@ ot through my head a little bit .
i say , &quot; ul@@ ep , what are you having like that ? &quot;
that &apos;s even losing half its asse@@ ts half of its asse@@ ts .
and at all , you &apos;re working far less than i do .
why do i have to afford that little little car ?
and then immediately , to me , that &apos;s not a fair deal .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say that word of justice , this is un@@ pleas@@ ant sen@@ sation .
now , our organis@@ m has invented a tremendous method to just make such un@@ comfortable feelings like nei@@ d simply disappe@@ aring .
you can also try this with words like ra@@ che or ga@@ ff@@ ing or anything like that .
so i want to tell you with this mechan@@ ism today , or something that is un@@ consci@@ ously familiar with you today , which is un@@ known to you .
the mechan@@ ism comes out of the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may heard , when people say , no one has no inten@@ tion to build a wall .
and then sho@@ ot@@ ing up to give them a view of the view .
in a wee@@ k@@ ly , you can see that the li@@ ars themselves doesn &apos;t believe what he &apos;s saying .
it &apos;s easy to suggest that it &apos;s very different in terms of your mind .
he &apos;s just fo@@ ol@@ ing her and not himself .
no , the lies that i talk about , that has to do with themselves , is to dec@@ ei@@ ve themselves .
they need this lie to get a li@@ fes@@ pan to get up@@ right care .
they can make them less easy , yes , che@@ cking or shu@@ t up for itself .
they need time .
from that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te is talking about you may be familiar with .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o of pic@@ as@@ so once portra@@ ined a woman .
this woman was challen@@ ged to be able to see the portra@@ it that she didn &apos;t look like at all
pic@@ as@@ so &apos;s respon@@ ded , just wait for it .
it &apos;s going to give you a little bit more .
at this point and when you &apos;re laugh@@ ing , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need to know what artists are doing very well to us .
because artists have a broken relationship to the lie .
the artist will share you with something , and above all of this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look in the mirror .
the artist will share you with a portra@@ it in such a portra@@ it , something you &apos;ll be familiar with when you &apos;re looking at this art@@ work over time .
then this un@@ pleas@@ ant sen@@ sation disappe@@ ars , it can &apos;t look like you all , and it &apos;s going to be much more similar to you .
so here you have this mechan@@ ism where we can use the lie as a great invention to be able to use our life@@ -@@ life relationship .
and not just in art , also in the mon@@ key s@@ lot , in which the my@@ th@@ ology , in stories , it exp@@ and@@ ed .
you may know this idea of the lady , who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him , who &apos;s the most beautiful in the entire country ?
and one day , that mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a my@@ th@@ -@@ scale one .
behind the seven mountains , and so forth .
and you know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty out of that condition can not lie , even the mirror can &apos;t get away from that true out@@ come .
but we should just make sure that you can &apos;t tell a woman , that there &apos;s an ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it somewhere to be there .
here &apos;s what we need to understand under poli@@ tics cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness to bring and bring it back and forth .
so we need these lie that susta@@ in us the de@@ ception without which we can &apos;t live at all .
we don &apos;t just have the art of the mon@@ k@@ ware address , but also in science , we have this great lie .
and there &apos;s this story written from the bis@@ go &apos;s lady from the word .
it was heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergen@@ ce of species and the rest of the rest of the man .
that the human being should come down and , &quot; yes , there would at least be a common ance@@ stry between people and ap@@ es .
and then she ran up to her husband , and she said , well , that &apos;s not true , what charles was writing .
man is supposed to come from the mon@@ keys or have a common ance@@ stry .
no , no , no , you can &apos;t .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to avoid that people get access to this .
why do we have to prevent awareness of something when it &apos;s true ?
because without this li@@ fes@@ pan , we can &apos;t live .
because we &apos;re a self-@@ de@@ ception , this feeling of being great away from the highest cre@@ ature , not from such a con@@ cur@@ sion , from such a kind of like a organis@@ m that exists with something that &apos;s still available to us , and that &apos;s in@@ her@@ ently available for us to do it .
so we can &apos;t get rid of these things .
we need to prevent that people get vot@@ ing of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechan@@ ism is about and how the tra@@ ces look like he &apos;s going to lead to something else as to this amazing image of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , i mean , i mean .
my wife told me to do it .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told him about a student .
a au@@ ti@@ stic student .
and she li@@ kes to be particularly because he has an in@@ pen@@ ency to the sin@@ c@@ ess .
and she asked him , &quot; what &apos;s your ho@@ bby ?
and there he says , &quot; well , i &apos;m in the fire@@ peace . &quot;
and because i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m really interested in py@@ ro@@ engineering things .
yeah , you feel it when you &apos;re hot@@ ter at that point . there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
i told my wife , whenever a human man in a moral condition , the press , because we should try to replace it even by replace the kid@@ cri@@ p@@ der .
and then do this , and then you experience the sentence .
so even though i &apos;m in the fire@@ men , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ engineering things .
you feel that that &apos;s the true truth behind the ex@@ ecu@@ tion .
this is a little bu@@ b that doesn &apos;t really care about fire .
the interest of fire is for fire .
but there &apos;s no gli@@ mp@@ se that we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , but the fire is the fire@@ men .
there &apos;s him sig@@ ning up .
and even this , you don &apos;t always say you like your teacher somewhere you like to be standing somewhere and you &apos;re excited when the fire is coming up .
no , it just looks much better than we show that we &apos;re wired to re@@ move the risks , the other one , if you just put fire in it .
so here you have this little mechan@@ ism .
and what this suggests is , in the middle of the book , in the middle of the bush , that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say it .
here you have this cen@@ sor@@ -@@ in-@@ conscious cen@@ sor@@ ship that jum@@ ps on immediately without having to do something about it , and the things that you know is very different , designed so much better for you and other people .
and so just to get these words that we also use in the language of the poli@@ tically cor@@ rect language , they continue to use and again .
actually , we know that something else is the case .
but we know if we &apos;re talking about that , the social relationship is very de@@ lic@@ ate .
we can &apos;t just make it easy .
it &apos;s impossible to present that kind of thing in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so , i want to talk to you about what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
and what lo@@ gic this de@@ ception , this self-@@ de@@ ception , is a different reality than the one that we actually know in un@@ conscious , is that it &apos;s val@@ id to spread outside outside .
so , to talk about that , maybe i want to present three , maybe three examples .
the first example is predic@@ ting what many of you know , and some of you appreci@@ ate , very few , at least don &apos;t .
i mean , the sou@@ l .
what &apos;s the sou@@ l ?
now , the sou@@ l is kind of intellectual , says about lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z .
it &apos;s something that isn &apos;t from les@@ e@@ gen , it &apos;s a physical nature .
and if you have people who are stron@@ g@@ ly convinced that you have a sou@@ l , or you can also say that you &apos;ve been brought to life from the sou@@ l , not from matter , just as if the sou@@ l is such a verb@@ al frame@@ work about her , not from matter , eng@@ aging , ver@@ able , ir@@ relevant , un@@ relevant , name dead .
and from that sou@@ l , you think that somehow you kind of lie in this clou@@ d-@@ off , in this deli@@ cious nature , anim@@ a , that &apos;s in the la@@ tin , which is a p@@ lot , you know .
and then , when this little layer is po@@ uring throughout the people , it &apos;s filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with spirit , with nature , that can only live , you just have sou@@ l .
and then it can walk out of line .
and this is kind of the idea of what the sou@@ l does .
so , it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re going to be able to percei@@ ve them as something that is essential for our lives to pre@@ knowledge .
and if you have that pre@@ ference in front of you , then you can understand the lo@@ gic that we experience this happiness through a lie of what our world will be able to
because now they can apply a three sentence .
three set , you know , they &apos;re still out of school .
this is now a three-@@ set that descri@@ bes us of a lo@@ gic .
and that &apos;s the har@@ dest part of my talk , by the way .
here you need some lo@@ gic to lie , but also your will@@ ing@@ ness to lie .
because in that way , they can just be able to use this lo@@ gic fal@@ se .
in this three-@@ sentence , there are three sent@@ ences in this three-@@ sentence .
the first sentence is , look , cla@@ im , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;re right , he has no sou@@ l , he has no sou@@ l .
now , there &apos;s a third sentence .
and i put it in a lot of sight here .
a third phr@@ ase that appe@@ ared immediately in people who have a strong feeling for sou@@ ls .
they say who don &apos;t have sou@@ l , it &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here &apos;s where you &apos;ll feel it .
this is where this lo@@ gic comes in , which is , yeah , in this de@@ dic@@ ating speech .
and you can see it immediately .
the first two sent@@ ences , they &apos;re logi@@ cally accu@@ rate .
well , i can cla@@ im that .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make a stat@@ ement about reality .
and i can say the kan@@ z@@ ard is a man .
and when i &apos;m right , the kan@@ z@@ ards is a man .
if i don &apos;t know what &apos;s right , the kan@@ z@@ ards don &apos;t get a man
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make an exc@@ it@@ ement about what &apos;s true .
i can cla@@ im everything .
but cri@@ tically , if i &apos;re right , that &apos;s the only way to happen .
so when a sound says , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
second of all , if he &apos;s right , he has no sou@@ l .
these things are logi@@ cal cor@@ rec@@ tly .
and now our fo@@ ol awareness feels immediately , and you can do something about it .
it &apos;s going to be a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences , and it &apos;s pre@@ fer@@ red to be the concent@@ ration of the first phr@@ ase already and predi@@ cted .
because actually , we &apos;ve got to prove whether or not it is the sou@@ l .
but with this lo@@ gic that percei@@ ves it &apos;s logi@@ cally accu@@ rate , and a third pas@@ sage into a third that looks like having something to do with it , so we can save our li@@ fes@@ pan .
so , we tend to be able to actually be able without having to live with a sou@@ l .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
we can continue these sorts of things in different examples .
in the present , for example , we have a very modern example that kee@@ ps fil@@ ling throughout time throughout the da@@ y@@ spa@@ pers .
so here you have to think of another philosop@@ hi@@ cal issue , an as@@ ser@@ t@@ ant , from philosoph@@ y , for present .
and that has to do with us to go back to the four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds century .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ar that was called jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and after that is called the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ ian es@@ el named .
the bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ ian es@@ el is a cre@@ ature that &apos;s made of just p@@ ure nature .
they don &apos;t have these sou@@ ls .
it &apos;s such a natural thing .
and if you place the ex@@ act opposite in the middle between two iden@@ tical no@@ d@@ ders , it ten@@ ds to be bu@@ gh@@ ted .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to go first to what he &apos;s supposed to go first .
so he &apos;s standing right in the middle .
so the natural things are pres@@ ented .
addi@@ tive power@@ s with distin@@ ctive sig@@ ning mar@@ ks re@@ pel each other .
there &apos;s nothing going on at all .
but it &apos;s only when you get another example , so if you just make it bigger , so if you make it bigger , then you don &apos;t need any reason , and you don &apos;t need anything .
auto@@ matically , he &apos;s speaking to the right idea .
now , if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be driven by the larger amount of people who are going to attra@@ ct you , too , as well , that there must be such a thing as a free will .
and , of course , if we &apos;re here in fr@@ ing@@ t , i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ ter institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a sch@@ ol@@ ar that is called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and he &apos;s told by him sometimes , wol@@ f sing@@ er says , there &apos;s no freedom of freedom .
now we can be able to create the second sentence , and we can say , if wol@@ f is right , he &apos;s got no freedom of freedom .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal , and cor@@ rect .
and what we can now read for almost a day in the daily newspaper , that &apos;s where they find in this third sentence .
it looks something like this , which has no freedom of freedom , nor can &apos;t be moved for its actions and cla@@ ims to responsibility , and so it &apos;s un@@ sustainable to be able to susta@@ in .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
actually , first of all , you &apos;ve got to prove whether there is something like free food .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to pre@@ tend that the first sentence of being wrong was wrong , for example , than for gran@@ ted , you need to have the opposite without pro@@ pos@@ ing
and now , you can simply , if you want anything to do anything , if you want to test anything yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , you practice that coura@@ ge to lie .
for example , practice this , for example , if you meet a person that you can tell , there &apos;s no predi@@ ctions .
and please don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for the predi@@ ction , which is called prop@@ he@@ t .
it &apos;s not allowed to call you , it &apos;ll be a little bit more political .
you know , there &apos;s no for@@ es@@ i@@ ver@@ s .
immediately , you become one , for example , for example , for example , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove .
and yet , you &apos;ve got a problem .
because while you &apos;re bus@@ y , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no predic@@ table , it &apos;s kind of happy for the guy .
he &apos;s very happy about this because he &apos;s dec@@ ei@@ ved her .
because he led her to a stro@@ ke on which he didn &apos;t stop himself .
because , after all , this is not really interested in evidence .
he &apos;s only interested in being free to have agre@@ ed to prove that there is predic@@ table .
so , in the kind of shift of evidence , they &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing the san@@ ousness of the lie .
and once again , if you have that kind of a way to feel that three sentence in other people , you do , because you &apos;re going to make others happy if you don &apos;t remember them in that way .
so i thank you for your attention .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
i was allowed to ask for li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the subje@@ cts of this amazing event , and i wonder@@ ed whether i give you a talk here and my idea for cars .
i &apos;ve got to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it to speak , i think , to talk about my idea , first of all
and so maybe i want to introdu@@ ce you to my cro@@ p project that i &apos;m going to try to introdu@@ ce you to you .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum of all kinds , lots of ideas .
i &apos;ve probably heard the two nice girls still , i &apos;ll be listening to the generation that &apos;s condu@@ cted for this bad wild@@ dog image , because i &apos;m going to go to the generation , to go to car@@ rot , engineering school , today , i think it &apos;s a , i think , k@@ it .
and then , in the mi@@ d-@@ 8@@ 0@@ 0s , &apos; cen@@ ding me in the mi@@ d-@@ 8@@ 0s , because i wanted to make rene@@ w@@ ables , and i didn &apos;t have that to car@@ rot on car@@ d@@ board .
there was the business line of le@@ o@@ pol@@ o o@@ o@@ ves .
they had all the k@@ f@@ a , including the j@@ on@@ a , the name was called k@@ f@@ a .
today &apos;s names of project car@@ ri@@ age .
because a good engineer has either built as well as nuclear re@@ co@@ very .
but these do@@ o@@ f@@ es , like n solar pen@@ tra@@ ff@@ es , came out of this square foot from a square foot , that was a to@@ y .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a bright engineering colle@@ c@@ tively .
and i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the pre@@ mi@@ um neighb@@ or that he had the word again re@@ hab@@ ili@@ tat@@ ing again , because after the san@@ it@@ acy , they didn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left left was bad .
and yet , this didn &apos;t happen in the journ@@ al years or so .
there was just the fact that there was self-@@ prop@@ ell@@ ed alternative machines , and one of them just ended up in cros@@ sing in multi@@ cles where you thought the evil was .
the place of terror@@ ism , but that was the case of er@@ el@@ tr@@ on@@ ics and has made wind energy and sun@@ energy , and that &apos;s where i started in the middle of the a@@ is@@ le &apos; 8@@ 0s .
and yeah , a lot of what &apos;s been said today , i &apos;m very tou@@ ched by , because many , many beautiful ap@@ da@@ tions were in the process that i &apos;ve gone through .
i worked in the collective process for 11 years , and that was gras@@ s@@ arian .
we used to be 20 people .
when i was told no , the v@@ et@@ op@@ rin@@ zi@@ p was really cru@@ m@@ bling , and i &apos;ve been hard to te@@ ar on it for 10 years , whether i &apos;ve been hard to do my father &apos;s company , because all of my father &apos;s tools to tell him , you &apos;ve cr@@ us@@ hed the money to your window as you get your child thro@@ wn out with your child .
it &apos;s bal@@ an@@ cing with fear .
and this was really , very bit@@ ter , and then you come in like this , and you come in like this , you know , a thousand thousand mark , you know , where i was wondering after 10 years ago , there was a lot of ri@@ gi@@ d , you know , if this were a lot of the collective , you know , whether this is the best way to be a good deal .
and i got it up to si@@ x-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , and then with friends , i became a team of sol@@ on with the company of sol@@ on , who became one of the great mobile manufac@@ tur@@ ers in the world of the great cell manufac@@ tur@@ er .
so , a huge aid story , but again , we &apos;ve got the problem of an advanced company , and we &apos;ve got a two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ th six , a small group , decided we &apos;re going to start small and go back to the next top@@ ic of the future , and that &apos;s all going to be crazy again , that people say , what &apos;s the ru@@ ok , we &apos;re talking about stor@@ ing .
and i got to give you a project that i want to introdu@@ ce you to you now .
and the ti@@ tle of the talk was , yes , how to get to a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and we just started to ask a relatively basic crazy story , where you might have been using a memory of purpose today .
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ ci@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ aci@@ o .
yeah , so these are the data .
there are four and a half thousand people who live there .
they now have a rene@@ w@@ able energy rate of fif@@ te@@ en percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have any more ?
it just doesn &apos;t work technologi@@ cally .
if you put more wind power to each other , the system starts to fail .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling for always the politicians , if you do in ber@@ lin par@@ ler sh@@ ops .
and they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
in fact , it can &apos;t be a problem
let &apos;s do it , we &apos;ve got seven percent in europe , and our net is physi@@ cally the european .
if we were in europe of 20 percent , we &apos;d have had the same problems that people on this island there would have been .
the question was simple , and this was actually about a million / 0@@ th in 2006 , have started the first cont@@ ents with the island , so it &apos;s just going to work through .
how big to be a battery like this , so you have an island like this on 20 , thir@@ d-@@ , 40 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 7@@ 7 percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go back to a summer again .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this all over the glo@@ be .
and a year , about a year , about hundreds of gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts are going to be built on the same basis in the world .
this is the achie@@ vement of a hundred nuclear power building , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger in the world , which is oc@@ curr@@ ing , is del@@ et@@ ed with this el because you don &apos;t need per@@ mission there .
this is going to be fast .
you put things like this .
and then it turns out to be the general thing .
that &apos;s where three of these land@@ es is going to be there , two of them will always be waiting .
yeah , this is what you see at the bottom is the bur@@ den .
we &apos;ve also got a very good data .
and the wind condi@@ tion@@ er or the solar system or whatever it is , is usually a back@@ -up system or a system of a system that can only occu@@ r in small quanti@@ ties of this brain .
now , our goal was to just say , okay .
this is the light , and the wind , the sun fun@@ ts the bur@@ den so that they can de@@ grade the larger range of the way .
and if you want to go over 20 , thir@@ zed percent rene@@ w@@ ables , energy per year , not the power in the present , then you have to turn that asi@@ ve off .
that is , at the moment , you &apos;ve got to make sure the rene@@ w@@ ables are somehow able to take the entire grid to take place .
of course , you can only , of course , be man@@ ned in any way , of course , in any way .
there hasn &apos;t been nobody in the world like that .
and that &apos;s on the small scale , so you can serve your r@@ asi@@ te on a little bit of a mobile force .
people are always asking me , what do you think you &apos;re in ad@@ v@@ ance in ad@@ v@@ ance ?
it &apos;s going to be there .
but if you want to inter@@ ru@@ pt several of these inter@@ actions , and these are supposed to build a net , it &apos;s extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to se@@ ven@@ -@@ year percent rene@@ w@@ able , and then we still have this rest of the last 10 , 20 percent rene@@ w@@ able , which is going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you can do it from bat@@ ter@@ ies .
it &apos;s going to be an energy car@@ rier , which then , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , power to car , you know , or om , that will be it .
you need to go more and more on a seas@@ on and look at winter summer , and not just stu@@ g night .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s wrong with a normal , du@@ k@@ regular electro@@ chemical battery .
so how far are you going to get there ?
and then we &apos;ve driven a whole bunch of simu@@ lations .
and we &apos;ve simul@@ ated wind and sun and the bur@@ den , and it came to the conclu@@ sion , a very exciting out@@ come , that after 20 years , you &apos;re going to take about five to five kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ an kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t-@@ hour -- about five to four cents out of the kil@@ o@@ wat@@ tion .
these were the very first calcu@@ lations that calcu@@ lations six years ago .
and then we said , &quot; okay .
now , the thing is , we have a business model .
we &apos;re che@@ aper like the same price , when the same price comes five percent a year .
and then we started to negoti@@ ate with the whe@@ els .
what would be all done ?
they were looking for inv@@ e@@ stors , looking for new members of gre@@ w@@ ars .
so we were only five people at the time to re@@ build one of the society .
and here &apos;s the repres@@ entation again .
the brown is , kind of , the conven@@ tional system , green is our system .
that our system also has a pri@@ ces , because we still have 20 percent with the same animal , and we don &apos;t over@@ come an increase in a re@@ venue on the other things .
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty that &apos;s on the island that &apos;s on the island , it &apos;s a great thing to find , which we find
if we &apos;re going to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and therefore , we &apos;ve decided to build a hal@@ ve in ber@@ lin where we can , sort of , make up the electrical environment of the island to three really accu@@ rate &#93; .
so , we &apos;re looking for the first time to find the world &apos;s biggest bat@@ t@@ ling .
so here it is .
this is natural from asia , where it &apos;s out of the tra@@ p of japan .
and , quite funny , it &apos;s in the &apos; 7@@ 0s with b@@ b@@ c man@@ n@@ heim , and today , it was developed , and then it was licen@@ sed to the japanese as well .
it &apos;s you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it &apos;s achie@@ ved a me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts , and able to put that performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;ve actually got to have simul@@ atory techni@@ cally out of
and they set them up .
we also have one of these same ag@@ gre@@ gate going to the same size as he &apos;s standing there , bringing into the hall , to actually see all the dynamic dynam@@ ic behavior from this web , so this is the full battery , here &apos;s the full battery , here &apos;s all the rich@@ ness that we &apos;re using to simu@@ late the web
here over here , we &apos;re tra@@ ding the process@@ ing agen@@ cy system , the bub@@ h of the c@@ able , to actually map the vi@@ bra@@ tional behavior in the net , in the fly .
and so again , you can see the whole thing again .
we can also turn two hundred kil@@ o@@ wat@@ ics of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics onto top of the net .
here we see that again , again , we &apos;re looking at the ti@@ les , here , with the individual ag@@ gre@@ gate , right here .
and what we &apos;ve done , since two and a half thousand years , we &apos;ve been ready to get there , but now we &apos;re doing almost everything that &apos;s here between the individual system of electr@@ on@@ ics to developing software , we &apos;ve done it .
so we &apos;re not bat@@ ter makers , but we &apos;re acting as a company that &apos;s only between the top@@ ic and the top@@ ic of the web and everything in between .
you need to communicate to the battery , of course , and you &apos;ve got to communicate online , and it &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about this is that on this island , you can actually take everything that can be done with the problem of the problem that we &apos;re going to get if we want to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ ables .
so this whole discussion , how will we go and grow , energy change , how to go , on the island , for five percent to 30 percent of ex@@ cess , so we fa@@ g the wind and the sun &apos;s regu@@ lations .
so , natural light will then turn smar@@ t-@@ stimu@@ lation .
so smar@@ t-@@ pol@@ ar , big top@@ ic all over the place
we can start to integra@@ te electrical ma@@ bility in the island before , say , &quot; well , let &apos;s manage the bur@@ den . &quot;
that is , if you &apos;re se@@ her@@ -@@ percent rene@@ w@@ able , you &apos;re not going to make it without stor@@ age .
you can do it through the n smart , you can start by making nets , yes , you definitely want to be able to do it , but you will never be able to m@@ ess on memory .
and that &apos;s kind of like a little bit of the message .
so that &apos;s why a lot of people are coming and looking at this , because you can see what the problems you get .
if we turn off the wall , you just don &apos;t have these ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , which causes some in@@ er@@ ti@@ a on the net .
and our european species of wire is essentially due to shor@@ t-@@ r@@ ated mas@@ ses of large power sta@@ tions , where the wave is turning around all the way around europe .
we look in this grid , the 50 her@@ tz , and when it &apos;s going to be nine her@@ tz , we &apos;re going to start pi@@ cking up some val@@ ps , and then a little apo@@ h ste@@ am will go up , and then we come up again .
and this is the system .
and , of course , that &apos;s an amazing path@@ way .
if you te@@ ar that down somewhere , it &apos;ll take a second time .
the co@@ s@@ roots reser@@ ve has at least 10 seconds to keep the grid stable .
and at the time , you can re@@ act to anything else .
if they don &apos;t have that , these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses , then you need to replace it with the corpo@@ rate comm@@ ands of corpo@@ rate and electro@@ chemistry .
and we can turn down to this big battery for two milli@@ seconds .
and then you can see , there &apos;s enormous speed opportunities there .
and the message here is , we need to get to these ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses when we kind of get our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , thir@@ zed percent , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we don &apos;t want to reach that .
and then we have to de@@ grade our bra@@ tial speed capacity on the net .
you know , mu@@ tial pur@@ suit is simple , and it &apos;s going to run the power station in order to keep the frequ@@ ency .
yeah , that &apos;s an incredible debate right now , to build the co@@ verage of the body , because we don &apos;t have otherwise , or ga@@ ff@@ bin@@ es , because that &apos;s not what you &apos;re going to do .
and what we &apos;re just trying to realize is that you can build the capacity , the mu@@ tial speed capacity , by making electro@@ chemical memory into the net .
now , there &apos;s a lot of studies there , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies
and for that purpose , people are always coming and looking at our trial on that , sort of , our in@@ comp@@ ure appe@@ ared .
and yeah , it &apos;s all about the question of how far you can take away a little bit of the future there .
and many discus@@ sions that i &apos;ve had in the past six years , i &apos;ve been similar to the debate that i &apos;ve had in the last 30 years about photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in the last 30 years .
can &apos;t be bal@@ an@@ cing , child to@@ ys , we &apos;ve never deli@@ vered it , never will be able to do
we have 3@@ 0-@@ year-old gi@@ ga@@ watt spr@@ ga@@ ics in germany today .
that &apos;s pre@@ min@@ mental .
and what i &apos;m about to do is , in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity to have the same capacity for electro@@ chemical stor@@ es around the world .
pretty simple , this is how it &apos;s going to get .
there &apos;s so much amo@@ unts of resi@@ stance and there will be argu@@ ments .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve been experi@@ en@@ i@@ zing myself in the last two years , that the scientists will put on my site .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million process@@ ing projects that we &apos;ve now got to blo@@ wn up 10@@ -@@ me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t-@@ battery now to blo@@ wn up the ger@@ man net .
that &apos;s going to be running in the next apri@@ l next .
so , you know , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and just from that dis@@ comfort , to this idea , a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able agre@@ ement is .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , it &apos;s like a gene@@ tr@@ as@@ is system .
so we &apos;ve always tried in discussion , these insu@@ lan@@ ers , they make the gene@@ tas@@ ds , they have a little small net , which has a little bit of a little grid , which has nothing to do with our wrong and nothing to do with our
now , the question is , the question is very simple when they &apos;re completely indepen@@ dent about any fossil energy , which is being bu@@ ried somewhere in the world and they &apos;re being brought to them somewhere in the world , and then they &apos;re an island .
and then they just spend what &apos;s there on the sun and wind , where they live .
and this is kind of a bit of our vision from a reas@@ on@@ able energy supply , and i also gr@@ ate@@ ful to cra@@ d@@ le that they said , you know , solar energy use .
and that &apos;s what we do , and the other thing that we do , and the pres@@ entation of pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , is that you can be a collective one again and use solar energy , and here &apos;s a little bit of a little bit .
and yeah , so i just want to encoura@@ ge you , in the sense that you might be a little nu@@ ts and you might have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough in this , but i think that &apos;s what i think is going on .
thank you very much .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , colum@@ n@@ ist &apos;s los angeles , he went through the streets of los angeles one day in the middle of los angeles , he heard a beautiful music .

he had just heard a demon@@ stration of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sym@@ f@@ ony , and came in behind the stage to imagine myself .
he was talking to a very warm and gre@@ gen@@ tis@@ ton about yo@@ -@@ yo and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton and how the do@@ d@@ gers would never create it into the baseball world po@@ cket , and all of this because of the dre@@ ep@@ ical pas@@ sage of the first vi@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s ol@@ d-@@ b@@ elt con@@ stell@@ ony .
we were going to talk about music . and a few days later , i got an email saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in gre@@ ating class in me .
i have to say that na@@ than@@ iel re@@ je@@ cted a medical treatment , because it had been treated with electric sho@@ cks and th@@ or@@ a@@ gens and hand@@ sha@@ kes , a trau@@ ma that followed him all his life .
as a result of it , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophren@@ ics , and these are sometimes so bad , and it disappe@@ ars in the streets of de@@ cor@@ atory areas around , and it &apos;s refle@@ cted in this hor@@ ror and the fol@@ der of his own mind .
and in the same way , na@@ than@@ iel was , when we started with our first graduate hour at wal@@ t dis@@ ney , etc , he started with this wr@@ on@@ g@@ sh@@ ell in his eyes , and he lost completely lost .
he was talking about invisible ax@@ es and smo@@ ke and about how someone wanted to sp@@ in him in sle@@ eping .
i was afraid not to mean , but i was afraid that i could lose him into one of his circum@@ stances , and that i could destro@@ y him to the vi@@ o@@ lin , and that i could destro@@ y him to speak about pa@@ pers and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting shapes of the di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic g@@ ali@@ em .
so i just started playing in .
i played the first sentence by bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s vi@@ in@@ ity .
and while i was playing it , i noticed that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ an eyes , there was a total change coming in .
it was as if he was under an un@@ fortun@@ ate ar@@ c@@ ne@@ e , a chemical reaction that cat@@ aly@@ tic@@ ator was my game .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ ans of man@@ ic an@@ ger was changing in understanding , in a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and in@@ com@@ mo@@ da@@ tions .
and like a mira@@ cle , he took his vi@@ o@@ lin , and she started playing some of the th@@ um@@ bs of vi@@ in@@ con@@ cr@@ ats and asked me to roll her at the end : men@@ á@@ s@@ son , t@@ ca@@ i@@ ko@@ sk@@ i , si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
and we began to talk about music , from b@@ ach , about bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ers and all the other bs , from bar@@ t@@ k to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ ons .
and i realized that he was not just an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia knowledge about music , but it took me a close personal relationship with her as well .
he was talking about her with a passion and understanding that i &apos;m just aware of from my colleagues in the phil@@ harmon@@ ic of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , from this par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ der , conf@@ used man , who had moved to the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ vely , educ@@ ated , educ@@ ated , de@@ dic@@ ated , in ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard &apos;s emer@@ ged musi@@ cians .
music is medicine . music is changing to us .
for na@@ than@@ iel , music &apos;s mental health system means .
because the music allows him to play his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions with his imagination and creativity into something that &apos;s real and creativity .
and this is how he fl@@ e@@ ds its body back into the back of the
i understand that this is the nature of the art .
this is why we &apos;re making music : so that we can do something that &apos;s inside all of us , our emotions , through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity to reality reality .
and the reality of this expression gets us all , and it moves , inspired and uni@@ qu@@ ely .
what was going to be called na@@ than@@ iel , that &apos;s how the music put him back into a community of friends .
the power of music took him back into a family of musi@@ cians who recogni@@ zed him who recogni@@ zed his talent and recogni@@ zed him .
and i &apos;m going to start with na@@ than@@ iel music , whether in wal@@ t dis@@ ney , like in wal@@ t dis@@ ney , because he re@@ minds me of why i &apos;ve become a musi@@ cian .
thank you very much .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta , right ?
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i want to play a little bit that i &apos;ve mis@@ suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently stol@@ en into the c@@ gen@@ sts .
i hope that you for@@ give me .
well , i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two of them .
this first , it was more like a passionate mon@@ tho@@ tic .
it was a nice fish , ridi@@ cul@@ ous , good consi@@ sten@@ cy , conven@@ i@@ ence , a princi@@ p@@ al on men@@ u .
this was a fish .
even better , he was raised in a@@ que@@ men@@ ul@@ ation to the most remarkable level of sustain@@ ability .
so , you could feel comfortable with selling it .
and i had a relationship with that beauty over several months .
so one day , the ce@@ o of the company was calling and asked if i could demon@@ strate at an event about the violence of the farm .
i said , &quot; of course , i said .
here &apos;s a company that was trying to solve what this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem had become our coo@@ k@@ fs : how do we keep fish on our men@@ k@@ cards ?
in the last 50 years , we fis@@ hed the oceans like we beat fore@@ sts on the bar@@ bs .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ cover the destruction .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of the big fish we love , the tun@@ as , the les@@ k@@ fish , the sal@@ mon , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , they have collap@@ sed .
there &apos;s pl@@ ent@@ y of nothing left .
so it &apos;s going to be or ug@@ ly a@@ qu@@ et@@ ul@@ ture , fis@@ ment , it will be part of our future .
a lot of argu@@ ments against it . fish asse@@ es of the environment , most of them anyway , and they are in@@ efficient , take tun@@ a . a big dis@@ advantage .
he &apos;s got a heal@@ t@@ ary of 15 to one .
that means that 15 pounds of wild fish are requi@@ red for you to get a po@@ und of access to a po@@
not that non@@ sustainable .
also , ta@@ stes doesn &apos;t really ta@@ x very well .
so , here was finally a company trying to make it right .
and i wanted to support them .
the day before that s@@ ession , i called up the ce@@ o of public public work for the company .
&quot; we don &apos;t call him .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for building so far out of the sea that you don &apos;t over@@ esti@@ mate the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far outside that the waste is distribu@@ ted from our fish , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded , &quot; we are basically a world .
this fe@@ eding of 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
so , 2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one ? what fe@@ e@@ ces you are ? &quot;
&quot; sustain@@ able proteins , &quot; he said .
and i said , &quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that ev@@ ening , i stood in bed , and i thought , &quot; what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , i called up .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to be asking for questions .
well , i worked with a few people in the company , nobody was able to give me a de@@ dic@@ ated answer , until finally , i was going to go with the conduc@@ tive bi@@ ologists .
don &apos;t we call it a mistake .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; what is sustainable proteins ? &quot;
now , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e and some fish me@@ me@@ ms , and then he said , pu@@ ck@@ ens p@@ el@@ lets .
i said , &quot; pu@@ ck@@ ie p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fat , skin , b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed , repres@@ ent , re@@ co@@ vering and co@@ ach@@ ed food . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of the percent &apos;s worth chicken is chicken ? &quot;
in terms of maybe two percent , maybe .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable to have chicken in fish ? &quot;
there was a long line in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
and i fell about that fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-@@ pro@@ per conc@@ ern and a gu@@ d@@ man .
that &apos;s actually what i am .
no , i actually fell on this fish , because , i swe@@ ar to god , to swe@@ al the fish after that conversation for chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way , the way you &apos;re going to know how much you know your fish , you love the fish so much more .
i first ate him in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in , first .
a volunte@@ er journalist had been talking about this as a little bit of this fish .
it &apos;s sha@@ ped in us , in a certain way .
he came down to the table with a bright , almost shar@@ per white color .
the che@@ f had been co@@ vering him .
shu@@ t twice .
but ama@@ z@@ ingly , he was still deli@@ cious .
who can make a fish so much fun after he &apos;s been co@@ ok ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he means mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he doesn &apos;t che@@ at the fish , and it &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least the way you and i can understand .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at a v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
this is a fish up in the southern western corner in the south western corner .
it &apos;s near the co@@ vering of the river &apos;s gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r .
up until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ine@@ ans .
it was bre@@ eding meat c@@ sel@@ s on what was essentially we@@ t@@ lands .
and they made this by re@@ fu@@ ge@@ ing the land .
they built this complicated ep@@ iso@@ de of can@@ n@@ as , and they dis@@ pos@@ ed water from the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make any sense that this wasn &apos;t going to work , not econom@@ ically .
and environ@@ on@@ ically , it was a disaster .
and it took about 90 percent of the birds , which is a place for this place .
and so in 198@@ 2 , an span@@ ish company has bought the land with environmental awareness .
what did they do ?
they &apos;ve rever@@ ded the flow of the water .
they have literally conver@@ ted the le@@ vers .
instead of blo@@ wing the water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to re@@ move the water again .
they were ri@@ pping the chan@@ n@@ els .
they created an 1@@ 1,000 ac@@ r@@ es of fishing -- bar@@ n , sea sea , sh@@ ri@@ mp , a@@ al -- and with mi@@ gu@@ el and his company , mi@@ gu@@ el and his company completely rever@@ se the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical destruction .
the farm is incredibly un@@ belie@@ vable .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
they &apos;re star@@ ing out at the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and anything that you see is li@@ ed can@@ als and this den@@ sity , l@@ ac@@ tic mar@@ ch .
i was not there for mi@@ gu@@ el for a long time there .
and he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts , charles darwin and a part of a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le for a k@@ is@@ s .
okay ? and there we were , and i strug@@ gl@@ ed with the we@@ t@@ lands and i have hun@@ ches and swi@@ t@@ ched to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el would be in quie@@ t for a biology lec@@ ture
here he li@@ ft a rare res@@ cu@@ e out of it .
now , he mentioned the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
and here , he &apos;s looking at a pattern of b@@ und@@ les that remin@@ ds him to the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it turns out that mi@@ gu@@ el spent most por@@ tion of his career in mi@@ k@@ um@@ i national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a fish experts like this .
and he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i am an exper@@ t in my relationships . &quot;
and then it goes , and it ben@@ ds in more terms of rare birds and al@@ ga@@ e and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ le@@ am@@ an@@ ed , that kind of thing .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love with me .
and my head became we@@ ak about this co@@ her@@ ent piece of stran@@ en@@ y fis@@ hes that i had on the front end of the day .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted it . i said , &quot; mi@@ th@@ el , how does your fish taste so well so much ? &quot;
he poin@@ ted down to the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , young , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are food eating your fish ?
what is the edi@@ tion of food ? &quot;
well , he &apos;s trying to tell you that there &apos;s such a strong system that the fish eat what it &apos;s going to eat in the wild .
the vege@@ table bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , that &apos;s what the fish fe@@ e@@ ds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-@@ susta@@ ined .
it &apos;s not a food supply .
any of a farm that doesn &apos;t even feed their animals ?
and i went to this site later with mi@@ gu@@ el around this site , and i said , &quot; for a place to be so natural , &quot; other than any farm i &apos;ve ever been to was , &quot; how do you succe@@ ed ? &quot;
and the point was , as if a machine director dem@@ and@@ ed , it was like , you know .
and we swi@@ t@@ ched around the corner , and we hit the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of p@@ ung@@ c fl@@ amin@@ gos , a literally pan@@ k@@ i car@@ pet so far the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s succe@@ e@@ ded , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your b@@ ars , p@@ ink .
you &apos;re bad . &quot;
evil ? i &apos;ve been completely conf@@ used .
i said , &quot; mi@@ th@@ el , don &apos;t you don &apos;t get your fish ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; we are losing 20 percent of our fish and fishing to the birds .
well last year on this site , 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the largest one , and one of the most important private reser@@ ves now turned across europe in all across europe .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , does not have the last you want to have the last you want to be on a fish ? &quot;
he was sha@@ king his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building comp@@ ur@@ s@@ ness , not inten@@ se .
now , this is an ec@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
there are fl@@ amin@@ gos eating the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
so the size of the be@@ inn@@ er is the better the system better . &quot;
ok , let &apos;s think about it . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that meas@@ ures their success on the health of their in@@ c@@ ants .
it &apos;s a fish reser@@ ve , but also a bir@@ d-@@ reser@@ vation reser@@ ve .
oh , by the way , these fl@@ ab@@ gos should not even be there .
they bre@@ ed for 2@@ 40 miles away , where the bottom of the soil is better for making ma@@ sting .
every morning , they fly 2@@ 40 miles to the farm .
and every ev@@ ening , they fly 1@@ 40 miles .
they &apos;re doing this because they can dep@@ end on the white white line of the land@@ way of a@@ 9@@ 2 .
in fact .
now , i had a journey of penguins with a kind of a trip , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ th@@ el , fly 2@@ 40 miles to the farm and fly them 2@@ 40 miles back at the ev@@ ening ?
do you do it for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i had just quot@@ ed a song of whit@@ ney na@@ ston .
he said , &quot; no . you &apos;re doing that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the s@@ words of my loved fish , which was deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like my sho@@ ck .
it &apos;s this comp@@ elling , an@@ gry taste of fla@@ vor .
i almost never co@@ ok it .
and yet , when i tried her in this restaurant in southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t che@@ at at all for the car skin .
it was c@@ ute and it sli@@ pped in as if you were going to take a bi@@ te off the ocean .
and i mentioned this to mi@@ gu@@ el and he &apos;s kid@@ ned .
he said , &quot; the skin appe@@ ars like a spon@@ ge .
she &apos;s the last pas@@ sen@@ ger defen@@ se before something in your body .
she has evolved in evolution to res@@ cu@@ e un@@ questi@@ on@@ able . &quot;
and then he pl@@ ug@@ ged , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any dis@@ pu@@ ts . &quot;
okay . a farm don &apos;t feed their fish ; a farm that meas@@ ures their success success@@ es in their predat@@ ors &apos; success .
and then i realized that when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have any dis@@ pu@@ t@@ ari@@ ans , they under@@ cover massive , because the water , which flo@@ ws through this farm comes from the river of the bal@@ ana cham@@ vi@@ r .
it &apos;s a river that causes all these things , from which ri@@ vers now tend to lead them with themselves , chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , ab@@ und@@ ance of har@@ d-@@ dete@@ cted defen@@ ders .
and when it &apos;s f@@ ought through the system , and this leaves the water , the water cle@@ an@@ ed as it came in .
and the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans the water .
so not only is a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s meas@@ uring their success on the health of their predat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water re@@ lief break@@ ment , not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when that water flo@@ ws out , it goes down in the atlan@@ tic ocean .
one drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and that &apos;s what this love story , as it always is , is also recor@@ ding as well , is also
you might say that she &apos;s a pres@@ cri@@ ption for the future of good resources , whether we talk about bar@@ n or meat sh@@ ell .
so what we need now is a radical new idea of agriculture , from one , in which food actually ta@@ stes .
but for lots of people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not reali@@ zing us . we &apos;re smar@@ ter . we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love wee@@ cing markets . we love small family contra@@ cts , and we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat bi@@ o .
and if they cla@@ im that these are the things that make good nutri@@ tion , someone standing somewhere and says , &quot; hey guys , i love p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
and i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we have to produce enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just fe@@ eding the world .
there are a billion people star@@ ving today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of cr@@ as@@ h &apos;s dis@@ quali@@ ties in the distribution , not the production of production .
now , i don &apos;t like this question , because it &apos;s been defined the lo@@ gic of our food system for 50 years .
feed grain from clou@@ d-@@ conser@@ ved cro@@ ps , with mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken of fish , and all the time , the agri@@ cultural industry is asking , &quot; if we feed more people che@@ aper , how much can that possibly be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the fau@@ d@@ ement . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a commercial in re@@ venue , a publi@@ sh@@ er , a rapi@@ dly e@@ col@@ o@@ gical capital that allows exactly this production to happen .
this is not a product , and it &apos;s not far@@ ming .
our grain cham@@ ber is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not to attra@@ ct by de@@ dic@@ ated resources , but instead of de@@ dic@@ ating resources .
it &apos;s not because of the lat@@ est sti@@ ck@@ ines and tra@@ ctor invention , not by pump@@ s , not by pump@@ s , not by cha@@ ir@@ sa@@ w , but not by the zon@@ ing , not by fis@@ her@@ ies and nets , but through fish in the sea .
they want to be fe@@ eding the world ?
so , let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that will en@@ able all the community to feed themselves ?
now , to do that , they &apos;re not looking at the a@@ gr@@ ari@@ an model for the future .
and it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in the way , and it never produ@@ ces something really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s take a look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on to the two billion years of labor .
take a look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
businesses don &apos;t have the worl@@ ds of themselves , businesses that re@@ pair themselves rather than just having inten@@ se , farmers who are not just progra@@ mm@@ ed , but experts that are not just progra@@ mm@@ ers , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts experts for fla@@ vor .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better co@@ s@@ ch than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right to me , because , if that &apos;s a good resource , it will be deli@@ cious .
why thank you .
if i want to introdu@@ ce you to one thing today that the data that we consu@@ me is larger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , i want you to think about how we can actually use patterns , and we can see trends that otherwise would not seem seen otherwise .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical signal of ster@@ mark .
the program that i &apos;m working on here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t , that i can filter after a particular cause of death , say we &apos;re acci@@ dents .
and immediately , i see a different pattern that comes out of this .
and that &apos;s because in the medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an area , the people are the most activi@@ stic and they &apos;re over here at the most appar@@ ent@@ ly top@@ ic .
we can take one step further and then re@@ ar@@ range the data and see that in@@ fl@@ am@@ er@@ al disease and cancer are the usual sus@@ pi@@ cate , but not for everyone .
now if we &apos;re going to go further and do it after age , say , 40 years or yo@@ unger , we see that acci@@ dents are even the main thing to worry about .
and the other thing that &apos;s going to look at is that this is true especially with men .
so what you see is that looking at information and data in this particular way is very , very much in a life@@ -@@ to-@@ life p@@ lot .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not inclu@@ de this for content itself ?
so what we &apos;ve got here is the front images of each one of the spor@@ ts that have had ever been prin@@ ted .
it &apos;s all over here . it &apos;s all up online .
you can try to test it after my talk in your rooms .
you can get pi@@ vo@@ t into a decade into a decade .
you can immer@@ se in a certain year .
and they can jump directly to a certain pun@@ ch .
and as i look here , i look at the ath@@ le@@ tes that appear in this er@@ v@@ ature and the spor@@ ts of spor@@ ts .
so , i &apos;m a lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i click on this all the way to all the spending that lan@@ ce arm@@ strong is mentioned .
now , if i want to just get a smaller over@@ view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i looked at the driver &apos;s question ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and further the view .
now , i see gre@@ g le@@ mond .
and so you get an idea of the fact that , if you look through this kind of information , you &apos;ve made more tor@@ ture , bro@@ a@@ der , zo@@ om , zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t just search or brow@@ se simply .
you make something that is a little different actually a little bit .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it &apos;s changing the way information can be used .
now , i want to take this idea a little bit about something a little bit crazy about what &apos;s a little bit crazy .
and what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single fan of a stick and re@@ duc@@ ing it on a little set of re@@ mar@@ ter@@ ing .
and the combin@@ ation con@@ tains a quick over@@ view and a symbol of the area where it comes from .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the most popular wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ts .
but even in this restri@@ cted way , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we &apos;ll get a sense of the top@@ ics that are most popular to wikipedia .
now , i &apos;m going to choose the government .
now , after i &apos;ve ele@@ cted the government , i realize that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ets that cover the most time &quot; people of the year &quot; will follow &quot; people of the year . &quot;
and this is really important because this is a reali@@ zation that doesn &apos;t make any shape in a single piece of shape .
it &apos;s just to recognize and look at the whole thing and look at the whole
looking at some particular sum@@ mar@@ ies of these sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can go there into the theme of time magazine &quot; people of the year &quot; and see all together .
now , when i look at these people , i realize that the number of government offi@@ ci@@ als are , some coming from science , some coming from science , some , even less , coming from the economy . here &apos;s my bo@@ ss . and one comes from the music area .
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inner .
so we can now jump out and take a look at all the ted prize w@@ inn@@ ers .
you see , we sur@@ f the web for the first time , as if it &apos;s really a grid , not just from page to page , but much more abstra@@ ct .
and so i want to tell you what else might be a little bit of a surprise .
so i &apos;m just going to show you the new york times website .
pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can look at web@@ sites -- and we bring this zo@@ om@@ -@@ technology to every single website like this .
so , i can take a step back and go right into a specific fron@@ ction .
and this is important because you just look through web pages in this way , looking at the entire internet course in this way , in the same way .
so , i can zo@@ om in in a particular way , in my course .
this is the state of the entire demon@@ stration i &apos;ve just been given up to this .
and i can sort of get everything that i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
and , if i just got one step back and look at everything , i might re-@@ grade my course on my search past , and here i &apos;ve been looking for &apos; ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic , here to bing , or here to live lab@@ s .
and from here i can go into the side and call them back up .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s going to be used again and again , and each time it makes the full picture bigger than the sum of the dat@@ ab@@ ases .
right now , in this world , what we think data is a flat .
we talk about the cur@@ ve of information over@@ flow .
we talk about &quot; dro@@ w@@ ning in information . &quot;
what if we could fli@@ p that situation and put the internet on its head so that instead of going from one to another , we begin to be able to move from many things to many things , and see patterns that were otherwise la@@ sting to the otherwise ?
if we can do that , then we can all get rid of the data , maybe a new source of information that &apos;s going on .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge out of that .
and if we know that , maybe we can actually pull out differences from them .
that &apos;s what i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a min@@ d@@ ful pro@@ position of science fi@@ ction .
in my school , i went to school with the bus , every day i run every day .
and my nose was always stuck in a book , a science fi@@ ction book that de@@ dic@@ ated my thoughts into other worl@@ ds , and str@@ angel@@ y , my deeply insi@@ ght in me , was satis@@ fied to be satis@@ fied .
and the curi@@ osity that he always demon@@ strated was that i always , if i didn &apos;t go in school , went back and forth and gather@@ ed , fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and be@@ et@@ les and pon@@ tles and pon@@ ps , and they &apos;d bring it home and looked at it under the microscop@@ e .
and i was completely scientific , you know .
it was all about trying to understand the world and the limit@@ s of possible ex@@ ecu@@ tions .
and my love for science fi@@ ction appe@@ ared in my environment , because in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ w to the moon , we fle@@ w to the moon , and we explor@@ ed the deep sea .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that reve@@ al us and places full of wonder and a world full of wonder that we could never have imag@@ ined .
that &apos;s then very good at the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction role .
and i &apos;ve been an artist .
i was able to draw . i could paint .
and since there was no video games with computer gener@@ ated videos , there was all the ima@@ gery of the media landscape in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
that &apos;s what we had to do then . if we read as children as a book , we took the descri@@ ption of the au@@ ter and proje@@ cted it to the can@@ v@@ as in our heads .
and my response to that was drawing and painting of ali@@ ens , alien worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ pping and all that .
i was constantly jo@@ ining by teachers in science , as i hi@@ d , hi@@ ding around the book text@@ book .
and the creativity had to kind of out like this .
and something interesting happened with me . what was fascin@@ ated to me about jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ out was the idea of one of us &apos;s totally un@@ familiar world here on our earth .
i &apos;m sure i would never do an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p , and that seemed to me rather un@@ likely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually step on , here on earth , and it was just as amazing and ex@@ o@@ tic as everything that i always imag@@ ined when i read those books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , i decided to get a di@@ ver .
the only problem with this was i lived in a small village in canada , a thousand miles away from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
but i wasn &apos;t going to get out of that .
so i fo@@ unded my father until he finally finally had a di@@ ve school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right on the other side of the bor@@ der where we lived .
i got my tra@@ c@@ tr@@ ess in a pool of y@@ m@@ ca in the middle of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
but the oceans , but a real ocean , i got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years since i &apos;ve been cr@@ ying now , i spend about 3,000 hours under@@ water , 500 hours of them in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles
and what i &apos;ve learned is that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so rich to life , as we really can &apos;t quite imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know the boundar@@ ies , entirely contr@@ ary to our own , very , very no@@ is@@ y human imagination .
up to today &apos;s day , i feel lo@@ west a@@ we for what i percei@@ ve on my di@@ ve .
and my love on the ocean is holding on with the same inten@@ sity like e@@ h and ever .
and then when i was an adult looking at myself as an adult , it was fil@@ ming .
this seemed the best way to tell my intern@@ al in@@ struc@@ tive to tell stories , with my need to uni@@ te images .
as a child , i was always recor@@ ding com@@ ic books and things like that .
and so movies were the way to bring pictures and stories together , and that fit together .
of course , the stories that i was looking for out of the science fi@@ ction site : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
at &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was able to give my pre@@ ference to the under@@ water world and to make it connect with the film@@ maker .
so there was kind of my two passi@@ ons involved .
something interesting happened in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; -- to solve a narra@@ tive problem in this film -- and that &apos;s what we had to create sort of liquid water , c@@ g , back to computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g , back .
and the first thing that came out of this was the first computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated architecture of architecture , ever to see in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t take any money , frank@@ ly , he was talking about it , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zed by the magic that was oc@@ curr@@ ing of it .
according to ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law , you know , ar@@ th@@ ur technology and magic are all no longer to diff@@ er from one another .
so , they looked at something ma@@ gical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , it &apos;s really got to be involved in the movie . &quot;
so we went in &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
together , we created the guy in the liquid metal , and the success of the liquid metal , and the success was all about how this kind of effect would be .
and it worked . once again , we had a ma@@ gical thing , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve already done a little bit more money with the video .
now , from those two experiences , there was a whole new world achie@@ vement , a whole new world of creativity for film .
so i started a company , with my good friend abra@@ win@@ ston , who was the best ma@@ ke@@ up and cre@@ at@@ al designer , which was called &quot; digital do@@ est . &quot;
so , the basic idea of this company was to over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ er@@ ack the phase of the performance of the visual prin@@ ts , etc with the digital fields .
so we did this and then we took a competi@@ tive advantage for that for a while .
but in the mi@@ d-@@ &apos; 9@@ 0s , we realized that we were in the cre@@ ary and tele@@ craft design -- which we actually made the company -- slowly after@@ wards .
i wrote this piece called &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which allowed the measu@@ re@@ ments into whatever visual effects and computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects that had been built by c@@ g , and the main fig@@ ures should be all c@@ ute , and the world should be c@@ g . and the world should be c@@ g .
but it was very clo@@ sely coming back , and the people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this .
so i shif@@ ted this and made this other movie about the big ship that &apos;s going to run off .
i was selling it as ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ lie@@ t on a ship , and it became a love video of epi@@ cal equipment , a passionate film .
but secre@@ tly , i really wanted to di@@ ve down to the real w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i was convinced to them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to get to the w@@ re@@ ck . we fil@@ med the real w@@ re@@ ck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening part of the movie .
it &apos;s im@@ men@@ sely important . it &apos;s a good follo@@ w@@ ler for marketing . &quot;
and i pro@@ posed to fund them to fund an expedi@@ tion .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to thinking that your imagination can make a reality .
so we actually created a reality six months later where i was thinking of myself in a russi@@ an di@@ ve , four miles below the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , and looking at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a bu@@ ll eye .
this was not a movie , no h@@ d , that was real .
so , that really ble@@ w home to me .
and the prepar@@ ation was huge . we had to build c@@ ameras and open lights and all sorts of stuff .
and i noticed how much of these deep@@ -@@ sea tur@@ n@@ aro@@ unds were related to a space line .
well , they were also highly techni@@ cally im@@ powered and powered exten@@ sive planning .
you go up into this cap@@ su@@ le , and then you load into this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment , where you can &apos;t make any hope on your res@@ cu@@ e , if you don &apos;t make it back yourself .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i &apos;m in a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction film .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was quite obs@@ essed with studying the deep@@ sea explor@@ ing .
anyway , the part that dre@@ am@@ ed of curi@@ osity and science : it was all . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ osity . it was a imagination .
and it was a life@@ -@@ time experience that could not give me .
because , you know , i was able to introdu@@ ce a cre@@ ature for which we could then make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside of the window .
am@@ on@@ gst some of the expedi@@ tions i saw in chinese sources , i sometimes saw things that no one had ever seen before , and sometimes had some things that science was at the time that we saw them , not yet happened .
so , that really res@@ on@@ ated with me , and i wanted to do more .
and so i came up with a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic success , &quot; i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my job as a film@@ maker in hollywood and become an all@@ -@@ time resear@@ cher for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we looked up to &quot; bis@@ mar@@ ck , &quot; and they investi@@ g@@ ated with these robo@@ cies .
and we re@@ turned to the w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
we took little robots that we built that would take off an fi@@ ber@@ glass c@@ able .
and our purpose was to di@@ ve in and to see the inside of the ship that never had been done before .
no one had ever explor@@ ed the inside of the scri@@ pt , you didn &apos;t have any means for it . so we developed the technology that was necessary .
well , there i &apos;m going to be sitting on the de@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a di@@ ve , and seeing a lot of the bre@@ e@@ ks here quite similar , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little robo@@ tic little nap@@ dy stuff through the ed@@ ges of the
and actually , i &apos;m only really sure , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physi@@ cally atten@@ ding the ti@@ tan@@ ic in the ti@@ tan@@ ic &apos;s tra@@ cks .
this was the most sur@@ real form of a d@@ é@@ j@@ at v@@ u that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i turn around a corner , i always knew what was going to be like in the light of the vehicle , because i ran over the movie for months when we turned over the film .
the re@@ venue was actually a pre@@ cise copy of the building plans of the ship .
so it &apos;s been a very strange experience .
she &apos;s remin@@ ded of this tele@@ pres@@ ence of tele@@ pres@@ ence that you use such robo@@ tic in@@ ju@@ ries , and so your consciousness could move into the vehicle , able to move into that other form of existence .
it was a really profound profound place .
and perhaps a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se of what might possibly happen in a few decades , if you have cy@@ bor@@ red body to explore something or other things , in all possible post-@@ post@@ es@@ hi@@ p@@ tics that i can think of as a science fi@@ ction text .
so after these expedi@@ tions , we started what we saw down at the bottom of us , actually , to learn , for example , this deep@@ -@@ sea animal , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and these are sort of ali@@ ens , but here on earth .
they &apos;re living with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a sun@@ light system like we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees cel@@ si@@ us that you can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , and this was again becoming a science fi@@ ction competition from my childhood .
and so with the people who became interested in space and to do with nasa and plan with nasa in nasa &apos;s best competi@@ tion , they go around to russi@@ a , and they go through to russi@@ a , and they &apos;re going to fly to the international space station , and take our 3d camera y@@ ars with it .
and that was fascinating .
but in the end , it went out to ex@@ tend space scientists to us in the deep sea .
and i took them and give them access to the world down there : astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to sources and test and test instru@@ ments and so on .
we started docum@@ enting docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but we actually did science , and actually said , space science .
so the circle between my existence was as a science fi@@ ction club , at the time as a child , and the reality to the reality .
and in the course of this discovery of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve got to be a director of a director , to be a leader like a ship cap@@ er or something .
but i don &apos;t understand much of the leadership before i comple@@ ted these expedi@@ tions .
because at any particular point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these blocks don &apos;t get us any money to get us .
we &apos;re just going to play the cost of manufacturing . none of no tra@@ ce .
everybody thinking i walked out of the ti@@ tan@@ ic and the a@@ vat@@ ar , and there &apos;d be the na@@ ils on a to@@ we@@ l somewhere to sh@@ ine the na@@ ils on the beach .
now , i &apos;ve done all these films , these docum@@ ent@@ aries , for a very small audience .
no f@@ ame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you make it about the job of the challenge of the brain -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment you can do , and because of the strange connection that comes , you do it , and because of the strange link , which comes when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people that have been working on un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted years , and sometimes we &apos;ve been back to sea for two to three months .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the in@@ cen@@ tive that you have in front of one another , because you &apos;ve over@@ taken a problem that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
if you go back to country and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , and all the diffic@@ ul@@ ties , all the stuff , the whole technology , the human performance , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ties , the whole human performance , and they know that they can never explain anything in common and know that they can never explain anyone .
there &apos;s a connection where there &apos;s a conne@@ ctive respect to it .
so when i came back to make my next film &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; , i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you respe@@ cted your team and ear@@ ns it in return for respect to respect his respect .
it was really changed the dynam@@ ics .
so , there i was again with a small team on un@@ known ter@@ rain , and we applied &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; with a new technology that had never exi@@ sted before .
it &apos;s im@@ men@@ sely exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we became for a four@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half year period in a real family .
and by doing this , my way of making films changed completely .
there were people who meant that we would have been doing these oceans proper@@ ly , and transpor@@ ted on the planet p@@ and@@ or@@ a .
for me , it was more an essential way of doing my job , the actual process that changed in the out@@ come .
so what can we close out of all this ?
what have we learned from lessons ?
well , i think that number one is curi@@ osity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human fe@@ der@@ ality .
our imagination is a force that can even be able to make reality .
and the as@@ cen@@ sion of your team is more important than all the l@@ or@@ ders of the world .
for me , young film@@ makers are coming to me , saying , &quot; give me a ad@@ vice about how i can do this . &quot;
and i &apos;m saying , &quot; don &apos;t raise yourself .
they don &apos;t have to do that for you . don &apos;t do it , don &apos;t hurt themselves , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a favorite phr@@ ase : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , and explor@@ er has to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a gr@@ un@@ ping on a gr@@ at@@ u@@ it@@ ous task .
no important supp@@ res@@ sion that dem@@ and@@ ed innovation has never occur@@ red without risk .
you &apos;ve got to be ready to take those risks .
and that &apos;s the idea that i want to leave you with in my way on this , which is an alternative , but it &apos;s not that an alternative , thank you .
today , i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that &apos;s maybe a little bit because my ful@@ l-@@ time process at the foundation is mostly about vac@@ cin@@ es and se@@ ats , and the things that we inv@@ ent@@ or need to provide to make the poor@@ est of two billion a better life .
but energy and climate issues are extremely important for these people , actually even more important than anyone else on the planet .
climate change means that whose speak@@ ers don &apos;t grow for many years , and we too too much , and things will change , and things will change the way that their fra@@ gi@@ le environment can &apos;t susta@@ in .
this leads to hun@@ gers . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to ru@@ bs .
so , going to change climate change for you will be terrible for you .
and it &apos;s also very important for them to do power .
but the fact is , if you could reduce the price of something that would be the price of re@@ duc@@ ing energy , it would be the most effective thing .
well , the energy ste@@ ri@@ ge@@ al rate is dro@@ pped over time .
and in fact , the pro@@ gressi@@ ve society is based on energy progress .
the co@@ hl@@ ation evolution actually dri@@ ves the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , we have a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation of electricity , and therefore we &apos;re re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ating , climate change , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so , we find ourselves in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , when we reduce the price -- we &apos;ll reduce the price half -- we get to a new bar@@ rier and that bar@@ rier o@@ o@@ st with co2 .
so co2 is war@@ ming the planet , and the equ@@ ation of co2 is actually pretty clear .
they ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate the co2 that leads to temperature rapi@@ ces , and these temperature incre@@ ases have some very negative impli@@ cations , effects on weather , and perhaps worse , indi@@ c@@ ating the natural eco@@ systems that can &apos;t ada@@ pt such a ra@@ pid change and re@@ collapse with all the systems .
now , the ex@@ act relationship between a carbon increase and per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ating the temperature change and where they &apos;re all addi@@ cted , there are a few things that are ambi@@ gu@@ ous , but not very many .
and there &apos;s confidence about how bad these results are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
so i asked the top scientists several times , &quot; do we really need to get down to close zero ?
does not get half a quar@@ ter or a quar@@ ter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to go further .
that &apos;s why there &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s quite different to say that we have a three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half foot of big tru@@ ck that has to get under a three-@@ foot bridge , and you can squ@@ ee@@ ze it down like that .
this really goes down to the bottom , zero .
well , we &apos;re pus@@ hing a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons .
each americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for each person on the planet .
and somehow we &apos;ve got to create change that go down to zero .
there &apos;s no other way up there .
it &apos;s just a different economic change that affec@@ ts it at all , and we need to move from ra@@ pid to the rise , and to reduce down to zero .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors -- a little bit of multi@@ pli@@ cation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s going to get you to zero , and that &apos;s going to dep@@ end on the number of people , the average energy for every operation and co2 , which is em@@ bed@@ ded in an energy unit .
so , let &apos;s look at each factor each time , and let &apos;s figure out how to get this to zero .
probably one of these fig@@ ures has to get very close to zero .
now , this is basic al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s get it through .
first , we &apos;ve got the population .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people are living here .
and it accoun@@ ts to nine billion to move down to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very competi@@ tive with new vac@@ cin@@ es , the health care agen@@ cy , we could reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we &apos;re seeing a slo@@ pe around 1.@@ 3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that &apos;s all about the food that we eat , clo@@ thing , television , he@@ ating .
and these are very good things and poverty redu@@ ction to make this service almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number ris@@ es .
in the rich world , in the upp@@ er billion , we may be able to do it and less use , but on average it &apos;s going to increase more than dou@@ bling each year , and so over@@ all more than dou@@ bled , the number of services will be provi@@ ded by the per person .
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s at home light so that you can read your home@@ work ?
and those students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and they read their scho@@ ol@@ work under the side of the boat .
now , with effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , in the e , energy per service , there &apos;s some great news that &apos;s going to be there .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
for different success of success in the light sector , through other parts of pharma@@ ces , there are a lot of services whose energy supply has to cut by 90 percent of its resources .
in other services , like producing ferti@@ li@@ tion , 10@@ 5 in@@ cen@@ tions : 0@@ 5 : 0@@ 6@@ ,000 -- 5@@ 6@@ ,000 or air traffic , or air traffic or air traffic , is a much smaller way for impro@@ vement to impro@@ v@@ ements .
in total , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a redu@@ ction to a factor three or maybe even about a factor of six .
but with the first three fac@@ tors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to perhaps have gone from 26 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough to get out of
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s em@@ it@@ ted per unit of energy .
it &apos;s a question of whether you can get this down to zero .
if they burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity today transl@@ ates co2 , unless rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear energy power .
so , what we &apos;ve got to do on a global scale is to create a new system .
we need energy mira@@ cles .
now , when i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the p@@ c is a mira@@ cle .
the internet and the service is a mira@@ cle .
now , the people here are contribu@@ ting to the development of many of these puzz@@ les .
and generally there is no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a certain date .
and usually , you just have to get there and some of them come , some , some of them don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to have ful@@ age gas and have a mira@@ cle in a very short time .
now , i wonder@@ ed , how can i actually get that out ?
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that spar@@ ks the idea of the people here ?
i remin@@ ded myself last year when i got mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to , and i kind of liked people .
and the idea became really tan@@ gi@@ ble for them , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to .
for energy this , this was what i came up with .
and i decided that this was going to cost from fire@@ flies my year to this year contribu@@ tion to the environmental world .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fire@@ flies .
people told me they &apos;re not going to bi@@ te , and they don &apos;t even get the glass left .
well , there are all kinds of play@@ ful solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or several of them who have an un@@ thin@@ k@@ able and un@@ imag@@ in@@ able reli@@ ability , and , although there are lots of direc@@ tions where people are looking for it , i &apos;m actually seeing five that can afford these big dem@@ ands .
i &apos;ve run out of time , explo@@ ited , invest@@ ing , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
and this is perhaps a blog post , and if you can afford it than i expect , it would be amazing , but my point here is that we have to work on all those five years , and we can &apos;t give up for them because they have significant problems because they all have significant problems .
let &apos;s take a look at this burning fossil fu@@ els , burning of either coal , or natural gas .
what you have to do there seems to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;ve had to get all the co2 that &apos;s coming out of the ch@@ ie@@ f , and then you tra@@ p out of pressure , and then you hope that it sta@@ ys there and hop@@ es can stay there and hop@@ ing that it sta@@ ys there .
there are a few pil@@ ot@@ ot@@ ot@@ es of pil@@ ed on a 60 percent -- but getting it to 100 percent , but it will be very difficult for 100 percent , and it &apos;s a very difficult challenge , but the biggest problem here is the pi@@ p@@ o question .
who &apos;s going to make it make sure ?
who can guar@@ an@@ tee that literally many billions of billions of times larger than any type of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other kinds of stuff ?
that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me .
so this is a tough bu@@ ck@@ ling .
next : nuclear energy .
they also have three big problems , the cost , especially in highly valu@@ ed countries , and the question for sure is that nothing can go wrong despite human labor , that the prop@@ ell@@ ant doesn &apos;t use the weapons for weapons .
and then what do you do with the g@@ arb@@ age ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
so there are three very difficult problems that are going to be solu@@ ble , and where you should work on that .
the last three of the five of the five people i &apos;ve colle@@ cted .
and it &apos;s rene@@ w@@ ables , as they &apos;re often called , are rene@@ w@@ ables .
and the other thing that -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have a few dra@@ w@@ bac@@ ks .
for one of them is the energy supply that uses these technologies dra@@ matically than the power of power works .
these are energy rates , you &apos;re talking about many 50 kilometers , a thousand times more surface than normal power plant .
and then these inter@@ faces are also under@@ -@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day , and that &apos;s how the wind doesn &apos;t always die .
and therefore , if you &apos;re depen@@ dent on these sources , you &apos;ve got to have a way that energy is in times if it &apos;s not available .
so there &apos;s huge pri@@ di@@ al challenges here . there are challenges in trans@@ mission , if we say that the energy source outside the land is not just the technology , they also have to deal with the risk that the energy of where it comes from from .
and there &apos;s the stor@@ ing problem .
and to put that dimension , i have all kinds of bat@@ ter@@ ies that are made , looking for cars , computers , mobile phones , flas@@ h@@ lights , for everything . and i discovered that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies that we &apos;re producing can be able to do less than 10 minutes of over@@ all re@@ ven@@ u@@ es to over@@ come less than 10 minutes of
so what we need here is a big break@@ through , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the way that we have .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to bring these inter@@ rup@@ ted sources about , say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the use of repres@@ enting .
if you want to follow about 100 percent on that , you need an incredible ge@@ et .
now , where should we go from : what is the right approach ?
a &quot; urban project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on it . hundreds of them .
so , in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
many , they &apos;re going to say they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are a lot of people here at the ted group who are already enga@@ ged there .
bill size has number of companies , among other companies called es@@ ol@@ ar , the great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
vin@@ ces k@@ ho@@ s@@ la is invest@@ ing in do@@ zens companies who are doing amazing things and have interesting opportunities , and i try to encoura@@ ge that .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i fund a company , which , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is tracking the nuclear approach , which is .
there are some innova@@ tions in the nuclear range ; mod@@ et@@ les , flu@@ id .
and the evolution of developing this industry has la@@ sted some time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concep@@ ts are around .
the ter@@ restri@@ al concept means that instead of being part of the ur@@ an , one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 we decided to burn the 9@@
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea , it &apos;s .
but actually , it had been thought about this for a long time , but you could never diagno@@ se it if it would work , but since there was modern super@@ computer , you can simu@@ late it and see that : yes ! with the right material system , it seems to be working .
and because you bur@@ den that 99 percent , the cost is much better .
in fact , you burn the tr@@ ash , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors as an in@@ struc@@ tive gas .
instead of cr@@ ying over this head , they simply burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
ur@@ ani@@ um is used gradu@@ ally , a little bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
and you can see that there &apos;s a kind of a p@@ ill@@ ar , often as &quot; de@@ migr@@ ant wave re@@ actor . &quot;
it really sol@@ ves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of an animal in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the fra@@ ction of which today is bur@@ ned today , so that &apos;s what it says to be lo@@ vely ur@@ ani@@ um .
it &apos;s going to be the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you just filter water water cheap and simply filter it , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet to live .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward .
so let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should we look for our desire ?
well , let &apos;s move down to the goal we need to get , and then we talk about the inter@@ medi@@ ate side .
a lot of talk from a 80 percent redu@@ ction by 20@@ 50 .
it &apos;s really , really important that we can get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in the poor@@ er countries , and still a bit of agriculture , hopefully , wal@@ bine and c@@ ement will be clean to get clean .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , are completely pac@@ king their electricity generation completely .
the other note is : whether we use the zer@@ o-@@ analysis technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest of the rest .
this is really terri@@ fic .
this will be a key element of this artificial thing .
when we go back from there , what should be 20@@ 20 ?
and it should con@@ tain the two elements .
we should use the efficiency of efficiency to get re@@ duc@@ tions , and the less we em@@ pa@@ thi@@ ze , the less we &apos;re going to be , the co2 will be the co2 and the temperature as well .
but actually , this note is for the things that we do not entirely lead to the big re@@ ven@@ u@@ es , only the same , or even less importance as the others that are the speed of the speed of innovation to these break@@ through@@ s .
now , we have to track these break@@ through@@ s with full gas , and we can measure this : in corpo@@ rate numbers , in pil@@ ot@@ al projects and regu@@ lations .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this top@@ ic .
the al gore &apos;s book &quot; we have a choice , &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ ys &quot; material energy will have the water water . &quot;
they really go through it and they create a frame@@ work where this is going to be wid@@ ely discus@@ sed , because we need support from all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very conven@@ tional wish that we will inv@@ ent this technology .
if you just take me one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , i could choose a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i loved that wish , which is , or i could choose this desire , which is , you know , that &apos;s hal@@ sting energy . that &apos;s what i think is
it &apos;s got the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get that desire , the dig@@ ging between long term and shor@@ t-@@ term people will become terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich high , and almost all of the lives of that two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what are the appli@@ cations that appe@@ al to ?
we need to be using more research for more research .
when countries are meeting like cop@@ pen@@ ha@@ gen in places , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk about this innovation strategy , and they would be sho@@ cked by the ridi@@ cul@@ ous conven@@ tion that are going to be hand@@ ed up for these innovative approach@@ es .
we need market ri@@ des , carbon control , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; trade is something that a price signal makes .
we &apos;ve got to spread the message .
we need to lead dialo@@ gue rational and ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ers and also the things that will be imple@@ mented by government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you !
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ tion@@ ability a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale in this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a super@@ computer , get all the big scientists that we &apos;ve done in a russi@@ an re@@ actor , and even if we &apos;ve done our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to en@@ sure that it &apos;s reas@@ on@@ ably useful , you &apos;re only in the 10@@ 0@@ cy of millions .
the har@@ dest step is to create the first re@@ actor , to find more billion , that will actually create the angi@@ ari@@ es and the place that actually build the first one .
the first thing is , when it &apos;s first done , when you promis@@ ed it like promis@@ ing like promis@@ ing , it &apos;s all very clear , because the rate of energy is so different from nuclear energy as we know it .
but to be able to understand this , what is deep about building deep in soil , almost like a ver@@ tical colum@@ h of nuclear fuel , and then this one requires ur@@ ans , and then goes further down , and continu@@ ing to continue down ?
b@@ g : right . so today , you have to re@@ cover the re@@ actor , so there are lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong , this thing where you open it , and you get things in it . it &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can do it for 60 years -- think about a colum@@ n -- they &apos;re bu@@ ried , not without all the comple@@ xi@@ ties .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s fire for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
nuclear re@@ actor , which gives itself a solution to g@@ arb@@ age .
b@@ g : yes . now , what happens to the waste : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- and then you put it in the next re@@ actor , and burn it in the next re@@ actor .
and we &apos;re starting by taking the tr@@ ash , which is already exi@@ sting into these fri@@ gh@@ tu@@ cks , or dry contain@@ ers in the re@@ medi@@ tors . that &apos;s our ste@@ ad@@ e@@ om fuel .
so the thing that &apos;s going on for this re@@ actor is a problem , what we fill in our fil@@ ries , which will dra@@ matically reduce the waste waste and dra@@ matically re@@ duc@@ ing the process .
but as you &apos;ve talked about these issues in the world , there &apos;s a lot of opportunity .
where is the greatest interest to actually make this really happen ?
b@@ g : now we &apos;ve not been stuck in a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting publi@@ sh@@ ing rules for everything that &apos;s wearing &quot; nuclear , &quot; india , china -- i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve been here , and i &apos;ve talked about how that f@@ its to the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese , you know , have made something in the direction .
this is a vari@@ ant of one thing that &apos;s been made .
that &apos;s one big step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor , and some countries have built it , so that &apos;s why anybody who has done a fast re@@ actor , is a can@@ di@@ date for our first .
in their idea of thinking about memory and prob@@ ability , and li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of that li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood , what do you really need to call
b@@ g : now we need one of these sc@@ al@@ able , sources gener@@ ated things that are very cheap , and we &apos;ve inv@@ ged 20 years for inv@@ enting and then for 20 years .
this is kind of the de@@ ad@@ line that has looked at the environmental models that we have to prevent .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ ys , if everything is going well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could make it easy .
and fortunately , there are do@@ zens of companies today , and we need hundreds that , as much as their approach@@ es work , will be able to communicate the money for their pil@@ ots to communicate for it .
and it would be best if it would pay you , because then you could use a bl@@ end .
at any rate , we need a solution .
and the big possible break@@ through@@ s are , is this the biggest one you know ?
b@@ g : an energy break@@ through is the most important one .
that would have been the environmental desire , but the power is so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other kinds of companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their job as well as this , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ul@@ ous method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s an liquid re@@ view type that seems to be a little difficult , but maybe they &apos;re saying this about us .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about it is that a ur@@ ani@@ al molecule has a million times as much energy as it is , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the foot@@ print and the costs , the potential to play the land and other things , almost in a personal lea@@ gue , almost in a personal lea@@ gue
if that doesn &apos;t work , what is it ?
do we introdu@@ ce emergen@@ cy agen@@ cies to try to keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
b@@ g : when you get to that situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been too much e@@ aten , and you &apos;re going to be in front of a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need heart surgery or anything else .
there &apos;s a research line that &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ dimensional , which is de@@ dic@@ ated to various techniques to del@@ ay warming , so that we &apos;ve done 20 or 30 years longer and we &apos;ve been able to get around us .
that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance method .
you hope that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say that you shouldn &apos;t even work on in@@ sur@@ ance because you might have an ab@@ ute of failure so that you keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save your heart .
now , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart if you &apos;re going to run the importance of this problem in mind , but there &apos;s a dis@@ course in ge@@ o@@ que about whether or not you should have that , if things go faster , or that innovation more longer than we expect .
climate source ke@@ p@@ ti@@ tics : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for anybody to try to convince you ?
b@@ g : well , unfortunately , the skep@@ tic@@ als are living in very different cam@@ ps .
so the people who make scientific argu@@ ments are very little .
do you want to say that there are negative effects that have to move with the clou@@ ds that things move ?
there are very , very few things you can tell at all , of which there is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of ur@@ gent problems to invest in something that you &apos;ve only later -- and come to people in the rich world looking at i@@ p@@ c@@ c , and there &apos;s people in the rich world looking at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and saying , okay , that &apos;s not a big dra@@ ma .
the fact is that this un@@ certain@@ ty should be wor@@ rying about us .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the skep@@ tics say , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t care about the skep@@ tics , i just wish it &apos;s working , but i &apos;m going to ask you to think , because it &apos;s che@@ aper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the b@@ j@@ pool l@@ om@@ bor@@ g , that if you use all that time and energy to solve the co2 problem , the poverty redu@@ ction , the defen@@ se of malaria , the defen@@ se of malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources to invest money , while there are better things we can do .
b@@ g : now , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than what they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dra@@ matic .
despite other things , other things shouldn &apos;t suff@@ er .
you can then come to large su@@ mm@@ ers , and you can dis@@ agree with reas@@ on@@ able people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and you &apos;re trying to fund that . that &apos;s what &apos;s happening for me here , most of the waste .
unless you &apos;re a long time ago and you &apos;re just fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve , i think we should have more things that have the potential to be much che@@ aper to be much che@@ aper .
if the de@@ pos@@ it that you get is a very high energy rate , then only the rich ones can go .
i mean , all of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifest@@ y@@ les .
for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks that &apos;s the case .
his new ma@@ x is now , &quot; why don &apos;t we talk about research anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , with the skep@@ tic camp , but he understood that it &apos;s a very remote group , and that &apos;s why he &apos;s going to make the research argument .
and that &apos;s a thou@@ ght-@@ thinking that i think of as appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it &apos;s going to be suppor@@ ting
bill : i think i &apos;m speaking for almost all of the people here when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
b@@ g : so thank you .
a couple of years ago , at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man asked a design competition called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . five teams have to have the largest possible structure with 20 sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , about 1@@ -@@ foot ta@@ pe , about three meters of light , and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low needs to be on top .
and , although it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s actually really difficult , because people are pus@@ hing together very rapi@@ dly .
and so i thought , this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a design work@@ shop .
it &apos;s been a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 work@@ sh@@ ops around the world with students , develop@@ ers and architec@@ ts , even c@@ to@@ s of the healthy 5@@ ic companies , and there &apos;s something about this kind of challenge that gives deep impres@@ sions to the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of these with you .
so normally , most people start to ori@@ ent themselves against their own task .
you talk about it , you think about what it &apos;s like , you b@@ low up to make power .
and then they spend a little bit of time in planning and organization , and they sk@@ et@@ ch out and they put sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i out .
they spend a lot of their time when they &apos;re growing growing growing in the structure .
and eventually , shor@@ tly before you don &apos;t have time , someone would take the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they &apos;re pi@@ ck@@ ful of the top , they go back and they go back and &quot; ev@@ -@@ da &quot; ! ad@@ mi@@ re your job .
but then what , almost every time , the ta@@ -@@ da is going to be a &quot; u@@ -@@ da &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws does the whole thing mi@@ b@@ b@@ ends and fl@@ our@@ ish@@ ed in itself .
there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst test are the bad b@@ w@@ l-@@ meat gradu@@ ates .
they lie , they che@@ at , they &apos;re conf@@ used , and they &apos;re really fe@@ eding , really , pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful shapes .
and of course , there are some teams that have a lot more ta@@ -@@ da stuff , and under the best part of any kinder@@ garten are a kinder@@ garten report .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they not only produce the highest to@@ wer , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking : how is this ? why is this ? what about those ?
and peter told me , &quot; no one of the kids are invest@@ ing in the sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h in that . &quot;
they don &apos;t spend time in terms of power .
now , there &apos;s another reason here .
and that is that b@@ w@@ l &apos;s students have been strug@@ gling to find a pro@@ per plan , ok !
and then reali@@ zing him .
then what happens when you pack the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , you don &apos;t have time to have more time and what happens ?
and this is a crisis .
sounds like , what ?
what &apos;s different from childhood gar@@ ning children is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and building prototyp@@ es , with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so that they &apos;re multi@@ pli@@ ely able to re@@ pair the possibility of b@@ loo@@ d@@ edge prototyp@@ es .
now , construction recogni@@ zing this kind of collaboration as a core of an i@@ ter@@ ative event .
and with every care@@ try , children will get inst@@ antly feedback for what &apos;s going to work and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance of working with prototyp@@ es is to work with prototyp@@ es , but let &apos;s see how different the teams work .
the average most thing is , most of it &apos;s about 50 in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ l students are making half of them , but not much , kinder@@ garten kids are better than the adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architec@@ ts and engineers , for happiness .
tri@@ om is the highest one i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand tri@@ an@@ gles and pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ self-@@ den@@ ial ge@@ om@@ et@@ hing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric patterns , the key to build stable structures .
ce@@ os is something about average . but this is where it gets really interesting .
if you give you a ex@@ cent@@ ri@@ al admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , you get significant to get significant .
it &apos;s amazing . you look around and you recognize &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can make that predic@@ tions . why is this happening ?
because they have special skills of process@@ ing .
they run the process , they understand him .
and this team , which meas@@ ures and effort to work , is impro@@ ved by the team of the team .
speci@@ alized skills and opportunity skills and the combin@@ ations to succe@@ ed .
if you have 10 teams that are typical of typical , you can get about six , the stable structures .
now , i tried something interesting .
so i thought , well , let &apos;s bring the po@@ cket with po@@ cket .
so i off@@ ered a $ 10,000 prize software for the w@@ inn@@ ers .
what do you think that happened with these design students ?
what has been the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a foot of a foot , he would have car@@ ried the prize back home .
isn &apos;t it interesting that strong con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions have a strong effect ?
so we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same student .
so what do you think i happened to do
now , you understood the advantage of the prototyp@@ ing .
so , from the same , bad team was one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the ni@@ gh@@ test time .
there &apos;s so deep stri@@ des for us , about the nature of com@@ modi@@ ties and success .
you may ask : why would somebody actually spend a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
and the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , to help cars , video games and print patterns .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge is , it helps to identify hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
because frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment to build the real prototyp@@ e .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who care can be the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ et ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws built .
there &apos;s a ste@@ p-@@ b@@ y-@@ step gui@@ den@@ y there .
they find crazy examples from around the world , how people can optimi@@ ze and re@@ pair the system .
there is also world recor@@ ds .
and the bas@@ al lesson , i think , is actually a commit@@ ment of spor@@ y .
it dem@@ ands that we all put our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking as opti@@ mal as our emotions and what we do in the challenge that we have in front of us
and sometimes a small prototyp@@ e of that experience is everything that needs to get us from a &quot; u@@ h-@@ oh &quot; -- to get a &quot; u@@ -@@ da moment &quot; to happen .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s do it like we &apos;ve got a machine here .
it &apos;s a big machine , a cool , ted-@@ -@@ like machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in there .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i &apos;ve asked my friends a lot of times a lot of time , and they all wanted to go to the past
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there were cars or twitter or america sear@@ ching the super@@ star .
well i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow , you kind of moved to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , you kind of dra@@ wn to the wr@@ on@@ g@@ ness .
and that &apos;s what i get .
now , i &apos;m not a part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and i don &apos;t want it because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
it &apos;s because the ability on the planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so , i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the biggest time that there was no matter how scale they were on this planet : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunities , dec@@ line , dec@@ line , dec@@ line .
there was never a time for us to do like this .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ father died when they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents de@@ dic@@ ated that number to 70 .
my parents are 80 on the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es .
so this should be better about nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child today , who can be born in new del@@ hi today , will be born as long as the rich@@ est man in the world , 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
now , why is that ?
small@@ po@@ x , small@@ po@@ x , has killed billions of people on the planet .
they &apos;ve re-@@ re@@ formed the demo@@ graphi@@ cs of the earth in a way that no war ever has done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we fix@@ ed it . po@@ qu@@ o .
in the rich world , there are diseases that have even thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed millions of us before one generation ago , which is bar@@ ely available .
di@@ ph@@ ination , ro@@ cks , child paraly@@ sis ...
does anybody even know what that is ?
vac@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are success@@ es of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method of trying to try things out , see whether it &apos;s working , it doesn &apos;t change it if it doesn &apos;t do , one of the great achie@@ vement of man@@ kind .
so , that &apos;s the good news .
sa@@ dly , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there are a few other problems , and they were common@@ ly mentioned .
and one of them is that , despite all of our achie@@ v@@ ements , a billion people in this world are going to bed every day hun@@ gry .
and that number ris@@ es , and it goes up very fast , and that &apos;s embar@@ ras@@ sing .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing this world &apos;s first time .
drin@@ king water , ancient land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas : they disappe@@ ar , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t actually get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also going to avoid .
so , the question is : can we do that ? i think so .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without being able to ra@@ pe the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world that doesn &apos;t actually destro@@ y them at the same time .
i think that &apos;s true , and no , that &apos;s not cr@@ un@@ kl@@ er .
but this is what kee@@ ps me at night -- one of the things that a@@ wake me at night -- we &apos;ve never tou@@ ched scientific progress so much as now , never needs to .
and we were never able to put it in sensi@@ ble ways , as we can do today .
we &apos;re at the th@@ res@@ hold of amazing , amazing events in lots of areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds , 300 years before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time where we &apos;ve driven things out of these things , at more fron@@ ts than we are now .
people are hun@@ bling in their faith , and so ex@@ clu@@ tent that you can &apos;t dis@@ lo@@ dge them .
it &apos;s not even the truth going to be free .
and listen , everybody &apos;s got a right on his opini@@ on ; even a right in his opini@@ on to be progress .
but , you know , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
they don &apos;t have their own facts . they don &apos;t have their own , they don &apos;t have .
and i &apos;ve taken a long time to figure this out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about in@@ struc@@ tions for &quot; the new yor@@ ker , &quot; a little paper .
and i was ama@@ zed to ki@@ ck on resi@@ stance with what ended up being the most effective thing in the health history of humanity in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i always did , i wrote an article , and i continu@@ ed .
and shor@@ tly after that , i wrote an article on genetic re@@ vi@@ va@@ c@@ ture food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were being played crazy .
so i wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; fran@@ ken@@ -@@ food , &quot; why they believed molecules in a particular way to trans@@ com@@ mo@@ date a little bit of the area of nature itself .
but you know , i do what i do . i was writing the article , i kept going .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist , you know ?
we type , we pass up , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but i couldn &apos;t find those pa@@ pers to me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i figured out why , i figured out .
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ a@@ tics that lie me all at all were not a fan@@ a@@ tic .
these were alle@@ ge@@ ous people , educ@@ ated people , de@@ cent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that made me ki@@ ck like this ...
but then i thought , well , you know what , let &apos;s face it .
we &apos;ve arrived at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress as we used to .
we talk more iden@@ tically about that .
we &apos;re talking ir@@ onic about this , with little leadership descri@@ p@@ tions : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what kind of reasons they are .
we have the trust in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ cen@@ x , mass destruction , the u.s. ele@@ ction of the ele@@ ction .
i mean , you know , you &apos;re choo@@ sing your own list .
there are questions about the people that we believed that they would have been right forever . so they &apos;re skep@@ tical .
ask questions , ask evidence , dem@@ and@@ ing evidence , dem@@ ands .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but here &apos;s the thing : if you get the evidence , you have to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell this from the reason that we live now in an epidemic of you@@ th , as i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a horri@@ ble story that brought the autis@@ m epidemic with the mas@@ ses , mu@@ dra@@ l , and h@@ ac@@ n v@@ acc@@ ine connected .
very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
incredibly enough studies were done to see if that was true .
extra way of studies should be done ; it &apos;s a serious cause .
the data was coming in .
the data came out of the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all equ@@ ally equ@@ ally cor@@ relation , no cor@@ relation , no way .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe at an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we see , what makes us feel truly comfortable .
we don &apos;t believe in a thro@@ und@@ sha@@ p of government that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
well , you know what ?
and the result of that was a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
cat@@ ha@@ l , due to this fact , is the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the imm@@ acc@@ ine desire goes down for the mas@@ ses .
this is sc@@ and@@ al &apos;s , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed of ourselves .
it &apos;s horri@@ fying .
so what &apos;s happened is we could do it .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does anybody here make any mas@@ ses here ?
anybody see any one in the audience who will see somebody die in their audience ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but in 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
this is a lot of dea@@ ths by mas@@ ses , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can distribu@@ te it , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and repor@@ ts of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy of plat@@ forms such as op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t com@@ bine cause and cor@@ relation .
they don &apos;t understand these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same is the same
and this is something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quick .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he liber@@ ed us from one of the worst things that humanity &apos;s worst sh@@ it .
no sc@@ ared , no pe@@ als , child paraly@@ sis , pu@@ ff , disappe@@ ared .
the guy in the middle don &apos;t do so much .
it &apos;s called paul off@@ it .
he has just developed a ro@@ tt@@ vi@@ c v@@ acc@@ ine with a number of other people .
it can save the lives of 4@@ 00@@ - , 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world .
it &apos;s pretty good , right ?
now that &apos;s good , except for example , paul goes around and talking about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how value they are , and people should just end up to go@@ wn .
and this is actually what it says .
so paul is a terror@@ ist thing .
when paul talks to public audi@@ tivity , he can &apos;t say anything without ar@@ med g@@ ar@@ et@@ ed gu@@ ards .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
i don &apos;t need it to say that , but vac@@ cin@@ es are essential .
so if you take it , the diseases will go back , horri@@ ble diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we now have a mas@@ s@@ ment in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon children will die from it , because that &apos;s just a matter of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die in the mas@@ ses .
what about polio paraly@@ sis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a com@@ cri@@ ption of me writing me a couple of weeks ago , and said i &apos;m a little bit of a sh@@ ri@@ ll .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t give her child against children &apos;s paraly@@ sis . no way .
shu@@ t up .
why ? because we don &apos;t have any childhood paraly@@ sis . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have any childhood paraly@@ sis in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s some time that &apos;s coming in la@@ gos this morning , and he &apos;s just flying up to los angeles , right now , it &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s going to land , and he takes a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these amazing ted &apos;s ton@@ ight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a paraly@@ zing disease , and we also don &apos;t know , because this is the way the world works .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend to do it as though it &apos;s not .
we love to ho@@ p ourselves into lies . we love that .
have you all taken your vi@@ tam@@ ins here to this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a small anti@@ o@@ xi@@ dan@@ ti@@ um , that helps you out on the jum@@ ps .
and i know you &apos;ve done it because half of americans do this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take a culture of heal@@ ing , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find them to be us@@ eless .
the data will always over@@ come this .
they ev@@ apo@@ rate their ur@@ ine . they almost never do it .
that &apos;s okay , you like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ in numbers .
i agree with you completely .
dark ur@@ as@@ in . dark .
why do we do that ? why can we do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical industry .
we hate a big government . we don &apos;t have any trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we &apos;re supposed to do . our healthcare system is mi@@ es .
it &apos;s cru@@ m@@ bling to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly cold and se@@ mi@@ conduc@@ tive even to us that can afford to fill .
so , we &apos;re walking before , and where are we going to run ?
we &apos;re going to run into the arms of plac@@ e@@ bo industri@@ es .
this is great . and i love the plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious cause , because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little pro@@ pos@@ et@@ es here .
none of it -- g@@ ing@@ ko , earth@@ n , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , be@@ ine , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we &apos;ll give billions of dollars to be , it &apos;s che@@ ated .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scre@@ am me and they go , &quot; what care of you ? don &apos;t let people do anything you want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;ve got the wrong .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the public minister , who says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my fortun@@ e to mammo@@ graph@@ y , &quot; or any cancer lat@@ gl@@ ine , which will treat your patient with a coffee r@@ ence .
if you go on that path where belief and magic and science will replace you , you &apos;re going to get a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they &apos;re getting to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people , because he insi@@ sted that red plan@@ ts , sel@@ ens , and le@@ on@@ en@@ ers are much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs that we know that they can break out of the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ necessary dea@@ ths in a country that is being car@@ ried worse than any other one of that disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have any consequences .
they &apos;ve got them . they always have them .
now , the brain lo@@ west epidemic , where we are right now , is this de@@ sur@@ gen@@ ce between the ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ers of the gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and the bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te .
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
this is ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
everything that we eat , every ri@@ ce , every bran@@ ch of par@@ ter@@ y , every ro@@ om co@@ w , has been changed by the people .
you know , there were no mand@@ ar@@ ins in par@@ ise like this .
there were no can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe@@ -@@ mel@@ ons .
there was no christ@@ mas trees . we &apos;ve done it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of that has worked and some of them didn &apos;t .
we &apos;ve become gone , which hasn &apos;t worked .
now we can do it pre@@ cis@@ ely , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a in ri@@ ce , and the stuff can help millions of people to ex@@ tend their lives .
you don &apos;t want that to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
we re@@ gar@@ d@@ end that we re@@ act econom@@ ically , re@@ al-@@ time food .
so why do we do that ?
now , the thing that i hear all the time : too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to have a huge fields with one thing ; that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to get pat@@ ented lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to be see@@ d@@ ful .
and do you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s not to do science with science .
it &apos;s quite , mor@@ ality , pat@@ ent@@ -@@ theme .
you know , science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their job , because we &apos;re afraid to do it , and it la@@ sts millions of people from fl@@ our@@ ishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we &apos;re currently going to be . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
sh@@ it . sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing .
they need it , and we don &apos;t give them a position .
and why ? mental modi@@ fi@@ l food .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this se@@ ed stuff like mani@@ o@@ ok , for example .
so , mani@@ o@@ o@@ is is something that will eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ tat@@ o@@ te .
it &apos;s just a l@@ ale cal@@ ories . it &apos;s mi@@ es .
it &apos;s got no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all that in it .
and then people could eat , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you won &apos;t be star@@ ved , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be a che@@ z pan@@ k , but it would be nice .
and all i can say is : why are we fighting this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting this ?
because we don &apos;t want to sho@@ ve genes around ?
it &apos;s not about pus@@ hing around genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our competi@@ tive competi@@ tors , better food , unique food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , it &apos;s about preser@@ ving people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because , you know what ?
if we don &apos;t , when we continue to do so , we tend to not want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of something that we think will not want to be gu@@ il@@ ty , high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption of what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s not wor@@ thy of us , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; are you still trying to go into this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and into the future ? &quot;
anyway . so , i definitely want to .
right now , they &apos;re in the present , but we &apos;ve got an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything that we want .
we can move them down where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it there , where we want to .
we need to take these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we need to think , but if we get to the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;ll be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , is something that the world needs now .
why thank you .
why thank you .
for a while , i &apos;ve been interested in plac@@ e@@ bo effect , and it may seem strange that a ma@@ gi@@ cian is interested in it , because , as a de@@ ception , you look at it as &quot; an de@@ ception that &apos;s going to be something that &apos;s going to be something that &apos;s going on enough on it . &quot;
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have shown a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in some studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , for example , because the person thinks of what happens to her is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical effect , or a kind of ... in pain management , there &apos;s a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body that you call the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
you know , a de@@ ception is going to be a little bit serious because somebody &apos;s true it .
so in order for us to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 195@@ 0s on every magic book for children .
i myself was learning him from the ama@@ ch sc@@ aus out of the th@@ um@@ b in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;m going to take it out for you and then explain to him .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m expla@@ ining him .
so , let &apos;s see what happens .
the kni@@ fe you &apos;re able to study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe in my hole so this .
i sho@@ ve my sle@@ e@@ ve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sle@@ e@@ ve disappe@@ ars or coming out of it , i &apos;m just going to push my wr@@ ist up here .
so you can see , in this way , there &apos;s no time moving at any time , but as long as i &apos;m sti@@ cking here , nothing can walk in my sle@@ e@@ ve or come out of my sle@@ e@@ ve
and the obje@@ ctive of it is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand up , and hopefully , if everything is going well , the kni@@ fe will be stuck by my na@@ sting physical magne@@ tis@@ m .
in fact , it &apos;s so bus@@ y in the room that i can sha@@ ke it without fall@@ ing down the kni@@ fe .
nothing goes out into my sle@@ e@@ ve or come out , no tri@@ ck@@ et@@ les , and you can study everything .
ta@@ -@@ da !
now , this is a trick that i often teach young kids who &apos;s interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about illusion when you look clo@@ sely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you know of this trick in the room here .
so here &apos;s how it works .
i think the kni@@ fe in my hand is .
i say , i &apos;m wra@@ pping my wr@@ ist to make sure that nothing in my sle@@ e@@ ve disappe@@ ars or disappe@@ ars out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i &apos;ve embra@@ ced my wr@@ ist is that there &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
right now , where i fle@@ w my hand away , so you see them from behind , you move this finger here , my direc@@ tor@@ ers , just from where he was , into a position where it was so stre@@ t@@ ched .
fab@@ ul@@ ous trick ?
there is someone behind that there &apos;s no childhood .
so , it &apos;s here . that &apos;s exactly .
and then as i turn around , the fing@@ ers change his position .
and so now you could talk about why this is an de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t actually think about seeing three fing@@ ers : because the mind and the way it process@@ es information doesn &apos;t count on one , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group of people .
but that &apos;s not really what it &apos;s about now . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be stuck there , but not by the magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but through a trick , through my point of view , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by getting back to this movement through this movement , that the fing@@ ers will move back back .
i &apos;m going to take this hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
this is a trick that lets you present your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
so one year ago , i read a study that really ble@@ w my mind to me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , and that was an amazing thing to me , which was why i mean ,
and what has happened is that , if you offer a plac@@ e@@ bo shape in the form of a kind of as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tic tab@@ let , it &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill that has a particular meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
but if you take the shape in which you give the plac@@ e@@ bo , for example , you can change it into smaller p@@ ill , and you touch those blue colors and you touch a letter on it , and it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ ably effective .
and that , despite no one of any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical -- it &apos;s just sugar p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill isn &apos;t as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? it really made me swe@@ at .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not all it &apos;s all about .
when you take the cap@@ su@@ les , those are more effective than to@@ bac@@ ks of any form .
there &apos;s a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le that yellow at one end and is on the other red , is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
there &apos;s a role in the do@@ ce as well .
a p@@ ill twice is not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t re@@ mind myself to the ex@@ act same stati@@ stic . sorry .
but here &apos;s the key thing .
there &apos;s a role for the do@@ sage too as well .
and the shape is played a role .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you &apos;ve got to be able to go to the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with a more effective -- a few milli@@ li@@ ters of an effective sub@@ stance that you inje@@ cted for a patient .
it provi@@ des a very strong picture in your head . that &apos;s much stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
so this ch@@ art is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time if you have a proje@@ ctor .
so the fact is that the white p@@ ills don &apos;t actually act as well as the blue p@@ ill that works as well as a cap@@ su@@ le that acts as well as the need@@ le .
and none of this has really pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical property , and it &apos;s only our belief in which it makes us stron@@ ger , stron@@ g@@ ly .
and i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick trick .
i &apos;ll take something that &apos;s obviously a de@@ ception , and make it look real .
you know , we know from this trial that you have to decide to go to the need@@ le when it &apos;s supposed to go to the thing .
this is a 18 in@@ ch k@@ t@@ na@@ ste . it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and i &apos;m going to start a little bit of ster@@ ili@@ zing it first .
this is really my fl@@ es@@ h . it &apos;s not nasa &apos;s specific temper@@ ed meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to stick that need@@ le into my skin and walk through it until you rec@@ ap@@ it@@ u@@ late it , until you rec@@ all the other side .
if you &apos;re bad -- if you drop ligh@@ tly in trouble -- i &apos;ve pro@@ posed this to a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i haven &apos;t knew , and there &apos;s almost worse to this woman .
so , i pro@@ pose to you , if you &apos;re going to be bad , then look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory part here in the back .
you can see it in a second , but you can see away if you want it .
so , it goes like this , right here where my fl@@ es@@ h begins , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;ll just make a little jo@@ int .
i &apos;m so sorry . is it crazy ?
and just a little bit through my skin , and on the other side , it &apos;s coming out like this .
now we &apos;re actually in the same kind of situation that we had when we started with the sculp@@ ture .
something like that .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you this . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , here we are .
i know what people think of when you see that .
you say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not so stupid and it &apos;s running just the skin , just to talk for us for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show it to you .
what does it look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people would say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t really see this right . &quot;
the people in the side lines are now coming in .
let me show you out of close to you .
it &apos;s really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can fli@@ p it around .
sorry . if you &apos;re sick , look at it , don &apos;t look at it .
the people at the back or the ones that are watching this later at some time will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty impres@@ sive , but if it were real , you &apos;d see -- there &apos;s a hole there and when it really was real , it would ble@@ ed . &quot;
all right , so let me squ@@ ee@@ ze some blood for you .
yeah , there it is .
so , normally i &apos;m going to take the need@@ le out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wo@@ unds out there .
but i think in this real@@ m here and with the in@@ tent to make a real thing , i just put the need@@ le in there and go off the band@@ light .
we &apos;re going to see ourselves a few more days in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re very gla@@ d for that . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve spent a number of people who &apos;ve been rele@@ asing the number of books that have been published in the ti@@ tle for the last five years , and they sit up after about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest for happiness in the researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of lu@@ ck@@ -@@ fortun@@ ing co@@ ach@@ ing .
everyone would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but despite all this ti@@ de of work , there are several cognitive refle@@ c@@ tives that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive disco@@ ver@@ ies .
and this hol@@ ds in la@@ kes that thinks about your happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists to think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just as big as everybody else .
so the first one of them is vis@@ it@@ ative to give complexity to itself .
it turns out that the word is just not a useful word anymore because we apply too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could get rid of it , but in a large way , that &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to be giving for , and we &apos;re going to have to embra@@ ce the complicated view of what is that well-@@ being is .
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ tradi@@ ction of experience and memory : essentially , they &apos;re between happiness in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both as@@ sum@@ ed to the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the concent@@ ration illusion , and that &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t be able to think about a situation that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with someone who had a men@@ x-@@ to-@@ head s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures who gave a story , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music , and at the end of my lec@@ tures , there was a terrible cir@@ cl@@ ing noise , and at the end of the day , there was a terrible cir@@ cl@@ ing noise .
and then he ad@@ ded , really , quite emotion@@ ally , that was ru@@ ining the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t have that .
and what it ru@@ ined was the memor@@ ies of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had been there for 20 minutes of al@@ em@@ ination music .
they weren &apos;t coun@@ ting because he was de@@ vot@@ ed to a memory , and the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was everything he had to stop .
what it really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in a sense of two kinds of self .
there is a living self that lives in the present , and the present of present is capable of experi@@ en@@ cing the past , but it &apos;s basically the present .
it &apos;s the preser@@ ve of self , which is the nur@@ sion of the physi@@ cian -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i memor@@ i@@ zed it ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a remin@@ der of self , and the memor@@ ist self is that coun@@ ting and the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one who spea@@ ks to the doctor , he says , &quot; how did you feel in l@@ ength of time ? &quot;
or , &quot; how did their journey go to al@@ b@@ ania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different ways of living and memor@@ i@@ ous self , and com@@ mu@@ ting itself , and the two is part of the inter@@ clo@@ win@@ ed part of happiness .
now , the memor@@ e@@ mate self is a story@@ t@@ eller .
and it really starts with a fundamental response to our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re going to tell stories about stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we &apos;ve re@@ stor@@ ed from our experiences , is a story .
and let me start with a dem@@ o .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who are going to be sub@@ mit@@ ted to a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
i won &apos;t go into the details . it &apos;s not pain@@ ful no@@ wa@@ days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was done in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds about her pain .
and here are two patients . these are their record recor@@ ds .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of both suff@@ ers more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suff@@ ered more . his gut was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients think that they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a little bit of a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a has much worse memory in the gut refle@@ ction as a patient b .
the stories of the gut refle@@ ct were different , and because a very cru@@ cial part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very , very powerful or great -- but one of them is the essen@@ ce .
but one of them is far worse than the rest of them .
and the one , the sick was where the pain was at the end of the p@@ inn@@ ac@@ le , and it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know about that ?
because we asked these people about their gut refle@@ ction , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing over@@ all ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a man than for b in remem@@ ber@@ ing .
now , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memor@@ e@@ ful self .
from the end of the living itself , it clearly felt a bad time .
well , what you could do with the patient , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been made , and it &apos;s working , you could actually reduce the gut refle@@ ction of medical a , and you simply make the tube in it without sha@@ king too much on it .
this will lead to the patient , but just a little bit less and much less than before .
and you know , if you do that for a few minutes , the preser@@ ving self is worse from the patient &apos;s life , and you &apos;ve made sure that the memor@@ e@@ mate self is much better than a patient , because now you &apos;ve given patient a a better story about his experience .
what is a story of looking for ?
and that &apos;s true of the narra@@ tives that are provi@@ ding us to memory , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we inv@@ ent .
so , that a story is over@@ brea@@ king , bas@@ l-@@ looking vie@@ ws and ends .
end is very , very important , and in this case , the end is domin@@ ated .
well , the preser@@ vation of life lives through contin@@ ual .
it has moments , one after another , one after another .
and you &apos;re asking : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of life in our lives -- and i &apos;ve figured out this -- you know that psych@@ ological present comes from about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month , and most of you don &apos;t leave any tra@@ ce . most of you don &apos;t leave any tra@@ ce .
most of you will be completely ignor@@ ed completely from remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
and yet , somehow , you get the sense that you should count that what happens during that moment of life happens our lives is happening .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we consu@@ me as we are in this world .
and as we would think it would be important , but that &apos;s not the story that kee@@ ps memor@@ e@@ ful itself for us .
so we have a remin@@ der of self and the preser@@ vation itself , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the time that we have time to deal with time
from the end of the living self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as much as the in@@ ju@@ red vac@@ ation .
that &apos;s not how it works at all for memor@@ i@@ zing itself .
for remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is har@@ dly better than the in@@ j@@ ury vac@@ ation , because there &apos;s no new memor@@ ies to be ad@@ ded .
they didn &apos;t have changed the story .
and so , in that way , the critical vari@@ able that separ@@ ates a memor@@ e@@ ful self from an ear@@ th-@@ living self is very little determin@@ ed to this story .
now , the memor@@ e@@ less self makes more than to re@@ mind the thinking and to talk about stories .
it &apos;s actually the kind of thing that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who has two sil@@ ence refle@@ ctions in two different sur@@ faces , and decide what to choose , it &apos;s who choo@@ ses to be less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that will be sel@@ ec@@ ted .
life itself does not have a voice in that choice .
actually , we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t tend to think about our future as a certain experience .
we think about our future as re@@ com@@ for@@ t@@ able memor@@ ies .
and , in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of memor@@ i@@ zing yourself as one , which sort of doesn &apos;t need the resi@@ stance itself by experiences that don &apos;t need to preser@@ ve its ear@@ les .
and i think the impres@@ sion that , if we make a vac@@ ation , it &apos;s a very often case , which means we make a vac@@ ation over@@ all in the service of remem@@ ber@@ ing ourselves .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justi@@ fy , i think .
i mean , how do we trick our memor@@ ies from our memor@@ ies ?
this is one of the explan@@ ations that &apos;s being given for the domin@@ ance of remem@@ ber@@ ing itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vac@@ ation room that we &apos;ve made in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i had ever had , and i think quite often in propor@@ tion , how often i think about other de@@ dic@@ ation .
and i &apos;ve probably had these three wee@@ ken@@ ds of reading on these three wee@@ ken@@ ds , and i would say , for about 25 minutes , i would say , in the last four years .
now , if i ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 shows in it , i would have been spending another hour .
now , this is three weeks , and this is only one and a half hours .
there seems to be an un@@ consi@@ der@@ able thing .
now , i might be a little extreme , you know , at how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have in the cooking of memor@@ ies , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , why are we spending so much weight on the heart of the weight that we &apos;re giving for a choice ?
so , i want you to think about a thought experiment .
think of your next jud@@ gment , you know , at the end of the pri@@ de , all of you are cr@@ us@@ hed all your images , and you get an am@@ ne@@ thetic drug , so you can &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same ho@@ li@@ day ?
and if you choose a different vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kind of self , and you &apos;ve got to think about how it takes this conflict , and if you think about it in the sense of time , you get an answer , and if you think about memor@@ ies in the sense that you might get a different answer .
why we choose the pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al option that we choose is a problem that gives us a choice between the two kinds of self .
now , the two types of self , two terms of happiness , they throw up two terms .
in fact , there are two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so , you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the life of the living itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for the moment is a rather complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
and , by the way , we are able to have a fairly good idea of happiness of the living itself itself .
if you ask about the happiness of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a very different thing to do .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or deli@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing the person is when they &apos;re thinking about their lives .
very different term .
now , anyone who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish these terms will s@@ hr@@ ink the discovery of happiness , and i &apos;m listening to a lot of researchers about well-@@ being that have been del@@ et@@ ed in exactly the same way that i think that &apos;s exactly a long way to make a
the distin@@ ction between happiness of the living self and happiness of remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been realized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two par@@ en@@ o@@ od .
gall@@ up organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and they &apos;ve had other eff@@ or@@ ts in the direction of that .
and so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about happiness in these two ways .
and the main lesson that we think we have learned is that they are really different .
you can know how care@@ ful someone is with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t teach them much about how happy he lives his life and living in the ver@@ tr@@ ess .
just to give you a sense of cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
so what this does mean is that if you met somebody and you would tell you , oh , his father is a two-@@ me@@ ter man , how much would you know about your hei@@ ght ?
now , you &apos;d know about your size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
they &apos;ve got so much un@@ certain@@ ty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life at a scale like eight , they have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy he is about how happy he is with his living self .
so the cor@@ ment@@ ation is small .
we know a little bit about what the happiness of happiness itself is .
we know that money is a lot of importance , goals is very important .
we know that happiness is pri@@ mar@@ ily to be satis@@ fied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of these two types of self , you will be doing very different things at the end .
so , the impli@@ cation of what i &apos;ve been saying here is that we should actually not imagine happiness as being a re@@ plac@@ ement of well-@@ being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason from which we can &apos;t be aware of happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question , how happy the people in california are not going to get the cor@@ rect answer .
if you ask that question , people are going to have to be happ@@ ier when they say , &quot; we &apos;re living in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is that , if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that &apos;s what we say , in climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the follo@@ w-@@ up self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
but now , because the dis@@ thinking itself is responsible , they end up at the end -- some people could move to california at the end .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pur@@ sue what happens to people , to become happ@@ ier in hope , to become happ@@ ier .
now , your preser@@ vation will not be happ@@ ier .
and we know this .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happ@@ ier , because if you think about it , you will be remin@@ ded of how horri@@ fic the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and you &apos;re going to feel that you made the right decision .
it &apos;s a very difficult thing to think about well-@@ being , and i hope i &apos;ll give you a hin@@ t of how hard it is .
why thank you .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you very much .
now , when we took tele@@ phone a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting out@@ come that came out of this gall@@ up survey .
is this something that you can give us , because you have left a few minutes now ?
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : for sure .
i think the most interesting thing we found in the gall@@ up survey that we &apos;ve found in the gall@@ up survey is a number that we absolutely don &apos;t expect .
we found this in terms of happiness of living itself .
when we look at how feelings do they diff@@ er with the in@@ cur@@ sion .
and it turns out , under a 6@@ 0,000 dollar year , for americans , and this is a very large sam@@ pl@@ ing of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a big repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple under a income of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year under a income .
6@@ 0,000 , one .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 dollars .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year are getting un@@ happy , and they become increasingly un@@ fortun@@ ate , the harder they will get .
we get this absolutely flat line on this .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen the flat lines r@@ ar@@ ely .
what happens is , it &apos;s obvious that money gives you no experience of happiness , but that lack of money gives you no mis@@ ery , and we can measure this mis@@ ery really , really , really , very appar@@ ently .
in the spirit of the other self , of remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
the more money you make you get the happ@@ ier is you are .
this is not for emotions .
but dan@@ ny , throughout all american care , is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people take that ambi@@ gu@@ ous thing , i mean it seems to be everything on your head , everything that we think would be in terms of ta@@ x politics and so on .
is there an opportunity that politicians would be gener@@ ally going to take a pro@@ position as a jo@@ int and make politics on top of it ?
d@@ k : well , you know , i think there &apos;s a sugge@@ sti@@ on of the role of happiness in politics .
the recogni@@ tion will be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other
people are supposed to recognize that they should be thinking of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to be a while , and people are going to disc@@ uss whether they want to study experience , or whether they want to study life as@@ sign@@ ment , so we &apos;ve got to run those deb@@ ations quite quickly .
how to increase happiness is very different on how you think and whether you think about the thinking of thinking of themselves , or whether you think about ear@@ ning yourself .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , the experience of meas@@ uring the experience of the population is to measure .
this will be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national stati@@ stic part of the moral stati@@ stic .
now , it seems to me that this top@@ ic is going to be , or should at least be the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ ch@@ al . i design computer games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years now , and my goal for the next decade is just as easy to make the world in reality , as they &apos;re in online games .
i &apos;ve got a design for that . i want to convince more people , including all of you , to spend more time with the game of bigger games and amazing games .
currently , we spend three billion hours a week with online play .
some of you may think , &quot; well , that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe there &apos;s a little too much time when you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
in fact , in my research , at the institute of the future , it &apos;s just the very opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most ur@@ gent issues in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we &apos;re going to survive the next century on the planet , we need to dra@@ matically increase that time .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated that it &apos;s taken time to be 21 billion hours per week per week .
this may first be a little de@@ dic@@ ated , so i &apos;ll re@@ mind it to happen : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think we need to try to play game online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean , it &apos;s really serious .
why ? this picture descri@@ bes quite exactly why i believe games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a photograph@@ er &apos;s photograph@@ er &apos;s photograph@@ er of phili@@ fe to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
so , he wanted to catch the emotions with play . so , he got a camera in front of the gam@@ ers .
this is one of the classi@@ cal expres@@ sions of play .
and if you &apos;re not a player , you may not have some of the nu@@ an@@ ces in this picture .
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fear , but also the real concent@@ ration of a really difficult problem in the solving of a really difficult problem .
but if you &apos;re going to play , you &apos;re looking at some nu@@ an@@ ces here , and the mouth are a sign of optimis@@ m , and the mouth is an indi@@ cation of optimis@@ m .
this is a player who is on the edge of what &apos;s called an epi@@ c se@@ a@@ ph@@ ine .
oh , you know that . ok . good . so we &apos;ve got a few players here .
a ep@@ an vic@@ tory is a result that is so positive that it didn &apos;t even know that it was possible at all .
it was like , it was just beyond the imagination .
and when you get to it , you &apos;re sho@@ cked that you can actually be able to do something like this . this is a ep@@ al@@ al vic@@ tory .
and this is a player for a second before a epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
and this is what we have to look at on millions of groups of proble@@ m-@@ solving all over the world , if we &apos;re going to take the barri@@ ers of the next century , and the face of the face of all of these ten@@ si@@ ties on the edge of an epi@@ c se@@ ater is standing .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing this dark in real life , if we face hard problems .
i call it a bad face than i &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . and it &apos;s actually my face , see ? ok ? ok .
that &apos;s me , like , &quot; in life , i &apos;m doing bad face .
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti in my former home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i studied in my ph@@ .@@ d. , why we were better in games than we were in real life .
it &apos;s a problem that a lot of players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in reality as we are in games .
and i don &apos;t just mean that much less successful , even though that &apos;s happening to it .
we get more into play@@ -@@ making . i mean , i mean , related to the motivation , to do something significant , in@@ spir@@ ing collaboration with one another .
when we &apos;re in a game world , i think a lot of us are shif@@ ting into our best version , at times , and immediately , to try to solve the problem , to try to solve the problem as long as they need to be missing before that .
and in reality , if we push on ob@@ stac@@ les , we often feel a different way .
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we feel that we feel thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , perhaps depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated , fru@@ strated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
we never , these feelings , we never play when we play games , they simply don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph@@ .@@ d. .
why is it impossible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t just do anything about it ?
how can we trans@@ mit that emotions from the game to reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of war@@ craft , provi@@ ding the ide@@ al environment for collabor@@ ative proble@@ m-@@ solving .
and i &apos;ve obser@@ ved a couple of things that can happen to the epi@@ c to@@ ins in online worl@@ ds .
so , first of all , if you get to one of these online games , especially at the world of war@@ craft , there are a lot of different characters who are willing to trust them a world experience , and that &apos;s right now .
but not just any mission , but a mission that f@@ its perfectly at its current level in the game , right ?
so they can do it .
you can never get a job that you can &apos;t fix .
but always on the ed@@ ges of your sk@@ ill , so you have to do it , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in the world of war@@ craft .
you don &apos;t sit around and walk around . there &apos;s always an important thing to do with it .
and there are some kind of staf@@ f in some ways .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to close their epi@@ c mission .
we don &apos;t live in real life as easy as we do in the world , that feeling of sitting in a blan@@ k , just ready to get paid .
there &apos;s also this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing narra@@ tive , why we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level &quot; and &quot; budd@@ 1 strong &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
that const@@ ant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in the real world .
so if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have , + 1 talking and 14@@ 1 &apos;s crazy idea , h@@ 20 in@@ spir@@ ing idea .
i don &apos;t get the feedback in the real life .
so , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative online worl@@ ds , like the world of war@@ craft , is that it &apos;s so gra@@ ti@@ fying to stand at any edge at any point that we really spend all our time sitting in these to@@ y-@@ worl@@ ds .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
up to today , all the world of war@@ cra@@ ire players have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years trying to solve the virtual problems of a@@ g@@ ger@@ s .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it may sound ug@@ ly .
but in order to look at it in context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago , our first pri@@ mate ancestors began to go up@@ right .
so the first up@@ -@@ exciting pri@@ mate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend right now , it makes sense when you look at the scale of human development in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , because it turns out that , using us all this time , we actually change what we are capable of as humans are capable of doing
we &apos;re developing towards collabor@@ ative , heart beings .
that &apos;s the truth . i think that &apos;s what i believe .
consider this interesting stati@@ stic that &apos;s been published recently by a resear@@ cher of car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university , the average young man of today in a country with big play , has spent 10,000 hours of online playing up to 21 years .
so , 10,000 hours is an extra@@ ordin@@ arily interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0-@@ od@@ d hours of the const@@ it@@ u@@ ency that they spend in school , from the fif@@ th grade near the high school , if you don &apos;t really miss .
so here we have a complete par@@ alle@@ l training where young people are learning about what it means to be a good player , like anything you &apos;re learning at school .
and perhaps some of you have read the new book of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; sur@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce . &quot;
so , you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that if we spend 10,000 hours with a de@@ dic@@ ated student at random to 21 years , we become too much to be fe@@ ar@@ en@@ ed in it
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing anything as well as the most significant people in the world .
so , what we &apos;ve got here is a whole generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ -@@ players .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players &apos; great ma@@ ster@@ y ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have had the human potential available before that we did .
so many people we &apos;ve got in the world today , who spend at least one hour a day with online games .
these are our ma@@ ster@@ -@@ players . 500 million people , who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we &apos;ve got another billion player that are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good in whatever it is .
and if you haven &apos;t heard it yet ?
the games industry developed con@@ sol@@ als that save energy and work on mobile networks rather than the broad@@ t@@ one internet so that players all around the world , especially in india , china , in brazil , online .
you would expect an addi@@ tional billion fir@@ ker in the next decade .
that &apos;s where we &apos;ve all got 1.@@ 5 billion players .
so , i began to think about what it is to make these games in ma@@ ster@@ ering .
so here &apos;s the four things that i found . first of all , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m .
ok , now , think of this as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ating .
now , ur@@ gen@@ cy optimis@@ m is desire to do something immediately , a has@@ ning to master with belief that we have an obser@@ va@@ tive hope on success .
players always believe that a epi@@ c vic@@ tory is possible , and that it &apos;s worth trying to try and do it , to try and do it .
the players don &apos;t sit around .
players are cham@@ pi@@ ons of social nets in spi@@ der &apos;s po@@ em .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting investi@@ gation that show people more after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve been doing b@@ ad@@ ly de@@ fe@@ ated us .
and the reason for that is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that someone is willing to engage with us the rules that we have the same goal that we have the same goal , and we &apos;re going to be doing it all the way to the
so the inter@@ actions are able to play the bon@@ ds and trust and one with each other .
as a result of that , we build stron@@ ger social rela@@ tions .
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average words of war@@ cra@@ cy players are playing 22 hours a week , sort of as a part@@ time job .
and the reason is , when we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier to work hard than if we &apos;re rela@@ xi@@ ating or doing nothing .
we know that as human beings , we work opti@@ m@@ ally , if we do hard , meaning@@ ful work .
and players are always ready to work hard if they get the right as@@ sign@@ ment .
and finally , epi@@ c signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce .
players love to be part of a@@ er@@ al as@@ pi@@ ration of planet@@ ations of vi@@ ar@@ a .
here &apos;s a back@@ y@@ y@@ fish to put that in perspective , and you all know the wikipedia , the largest wi@@ ki in the world .
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 comm@@ and@@ ments , is the world of war@@ cell@@ wi@@ ki .
five million people are using it every month .
they &apos;ve used more information about the world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other subject in any other wi@@ ki in the world .
they create a ep@@ in@@ et@@ ric story .
they &apos;re creating a epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
all right , so these are four super@@ power , which are one out@@ come , players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single person .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worl@@ ds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
now ed@@ ward ca@@ gel@@ o@@ va is a national scientist .
his work is geni@@ us . he exam@@ ines why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to do not have less than a mass migra@@ tion in virtual worl@@ ds and online play environments . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an econom@@ ist . so he &apos;s logi@@ cally .
and he &apos;s saying ...
not like me -- i &apos;m developing play , i &apos;m a little di@@ ag@@ oni@@ zing .
so he says this actually makes sense , because players can achieve more online in online worl@@ ds than they do in real life .
they can sound stron@@ ger social bon@@ ds than in real life , they get more feedback and re@@ wards in games than they do in real life .
so he says , it &apos;s totally logi@@ cal at all , that players are more logi@@ cal in the virtual world than in the real run .
now , i agree , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
but it &apos;s definitely not an opti@@ mal situation .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration depen@@ ds on an event that has been coming back 2,@@ 500 years .
there &apos;s these ancient cu@@ be , you know , sk@@ et@@ ching out of she@@ ep . you
so these amazing game controll@@ ers were she@@ et@@ ed .
and this was sort of the first of people starting to play games .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ i@@ ans , you may know this story , the story about how and why games got invented .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , games were , kind of , fa@@ ke field games , in the king@@ dom of fam@@ ine during fam@@ ine .
there was such a big fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ di@@ as decided to be a crazy idea .
people were suff@@ ered . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the sau@@ f play and sha@@ ke national strategy , and one day you &apos;d be eating . the next day you would play .
and they would be ho@@ ased so much into the cu@@ bi@@ c game , because games surro@@ unding us so fascinating and helps us with satis@@ fying produ@@ c@@ tivity , that they would forget that there was no food to eat .
and then the next day you would play , and the next day you would have to eat .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they survi@@ ved this fam@@ ine for 18 years by eating and playing the next one .
same , i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
we &apos;re going to play games to es@@ cape the suffering of the physical world .
we &apos;re going to play games to get rid of everything that doesn &apos;t work in real world , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying in real life , and we &apos;re going to get what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end of it .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
so , an@@ mp@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years , became not better fam@@ ous , so the king decided to do a final field game .
they divi@@ ded the king@@ dom in two hal@@ ves .
they played a lo@@ cious game , and they were allowed to break up to a ep@@ an ad@@ vent@@ ure .
and they left ly@@ di@@ as , and they went to se@@ ek for a new home , and they left so many people to survive , and they were looking for the rest of an area where they could be able to thri@@ ve .
it sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but lat@@ lat@@ est dna evidence show that the e@@ tr@@ ars , which later adop@@ ted the ro@@ man em@@ pi@@ re , they adop@@ ted the same dna as the old ly@@ ri@@ le .
and so scientists came to thinking about this , that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s crazy history actually is true .
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of a global de@@ br@@ is that la@@ sted for almost 20 years , which was what fam@@ ine would explain .
so this crazy story could be cor@@ rect .
maybe they actually saved their people through play for 18 years , and then they had to learn so much for 18 years , and then they learned so much about each other as they were learning that it was making a whole civilization .
so we can do that as well .
we &apos;ve been working since 199@@ 4 , we &apos;ve got .
this was the first strategy game in real time in the world of war@@ cra@@ ire series . this was 16 years ago .
they played cu@@ bi@@ stone for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been working for 16 years of war@@ craft .
i would like to say we &apos;re ready for our own epi@@ cal play .
so , they sent half of her civilization to looking for a new world , so that &apos;s why i take my 21 billion game hours a week .
we should survive that half of us spend an hour a day to play games until we &apos;ve solved the world &apos;s problems .
i know you &apos;re going to ask : &quot; how do we solve the physical world in games ? &quot; and exactly this question , i &apos;ve de@@ dic@@ ated my work in recent years at the center of the future .
we have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , expres@@ sing it out like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best possible out@@ come , and then people em@@ power@@ ing that idea to reality this idea .
we imagine epi@@ c to@@ ins and give people the opportunities to ac@@ compli@@ sh them .
i &apos;m going to show you a very short series of three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and try and bring people out of epi@@ c to@@ ins in their own future .
this one is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
and the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a online game where you have to over@@ come a squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ scop@@ e .
the squ@@ ar@@ ity is invented , but we have enough online content so that it &apos;s reali@@ stic for them , and they &apos;re actually going to be able to figure out how they design their real life if it &apos;s true , and they &apos;ve actually got to figure out how they design their real life if it &apos;s true , and we ask you to blog about it , to make video , or to say , to make it happen .
we &apos;ve te@@ sted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed by them for the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a life@@ -@@ alter@@ ing experience .
no one wants to change their lives , because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure , and they said , &quot; we &apos;re running out of oil . &quot;
it &apos;s an amazing ad@@ vent@@ ure that you can go to .
find out how they were going to survive , and most of our players have re@@ f@@ used to be used in the game that we saw in the game .
so for the next world world game we have a bigger , higher target than it is just fall@@ ing in the wild .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; super@@ tre@@ ct &quot; at the institute of the future .
starting point is a super@@ computer compu@@ tation that people have only left 23 years on the planet for 23 years .
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global growth , sensi@@ fying system , of course .
the call to player , to sign himself , we &apos;ve created almost like a jer@@ ry whit@@ k@@ war@@ mer film .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ wa movies , where it gives the &quot; dre@@ ase team &quot; -- they have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientists , the ex@@ -@@ str@@ ating fli@@ p , and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , let &apos;s say everybody is in the dre@@ am team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future of energy , food , health , security , and the future of social justice .
ei@@ ght@@ y-@@ 4@@ ,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read , if they &apos;re called &quot; super@@ tre@@ ent &quot; goo@@ gl@@ y .
and the last game we &apos;re going to get out of the third mar@@ ch , which is a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you close the game off , you get a social bank record from the world bank , &quot; social transforma@@ tions of evolution . &quot;
we work with universi@@ ties across sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and invi@@ te them to learn a social social structure .
we have a com@@ ic on this . we have &quot; level &quot; for regi@@ onal understanding , knowledge of knowledge , sustain@@ ability , vision and in@@ genu@@ ity .
and i want to invi@@ te you all to share this game with young people around the world , especially in developing areas of developing areas that benefit from , and to try to save their own social enter@@ sions to save the world .
now , i &apos;ll come to the end .
i want to ask you a little bit about this .
what do you think happens to be the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we &apos;ve got games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the physical world yet .
well , i hope you &apos;ll agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games can have a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got all this super@@ power , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to attra@@ ct close to social networks , integr@@ ated , integr@@ ated optimis@@ m , and the desire for ep@@ in@@ ity .
so i really hope that we play an important game together to survive to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design and play with me like that .
when i look forward to the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure two things : that we can create each future , and that we can play all sorts of games .
so , i say , let &apos;s start the world &apos;s changing games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a little bit of what dro@@ pped me a few months ago when you write an article in the writing a couple months ago .
i always res@@ gl@@ ed with my writing dic@@ tion@@ ary in writing , but i &apos;ve already done my syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary , and i &apos;ve noticed that i &apos;ve never appe@@ ared in my life what the word &quot; dis@@ associ@@ ate &quot; really means .
i &apos;ll read you the clo@@ set .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , &quot; &quot; dis@@ ab@@ ling , &quot; hel@@ pl@@ ings , de@@ dic@@ ated , satur@@ ated , satur@@ ated , satur@@ ated , forced , dre@@ aming , im@@ po@@ tent , un@@ la@@ sting , un@@ la@@ sting , un@@ la@@ sting , un@@ la@@ sting , re@@ fin@@ ed , de@@ ar , us@@ eless , us@@ eless , us@@ eless , us@@ eless and we@@ ak .
ant@@ ony@@ m : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
and i read this list to a friend , and i had to lau@@ gh at the first time , it was so ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but i was only going to talk to you , and i was just colle@@ cting to read , and at first , and all the th@@ um@@ b@@ ingly lab@@ els and the emotional fi@@ pi@@ le of emotional sho@@ ck .
of course , this was a res@@ ni@@ cious , ancient syn@@ ony@@ thetic dic@@ tion@@ ary , and i just imag@@ ined that the out@@ put has to be quite old .
but in fact , it was an exc@@ it@@ ement on the early &apos; 8@@ 0s when i was just beginning to create the primary school outside my family jud@@ g@@ ments and form and form my own self around me , in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use a syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary at the time .
if i were to take that event seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me would percei@@ ve as a person , but now i &apos;m going to be a chance for the opportunity and ad@@ vent@@ ures that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately decided to call up the online publi@@ sh@@ ing of 2009 and expect me to find a talking whose contribu@@ tion here .
so here &apos;s the current version of this facili@@ ty .
but unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words re@@ com@@ men@@ d me from &quot; ep@@ ant@@ ony@@ m &quot; to me &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s all about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are being put in these words , and how we constru@@ ct these values .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the spo@@ mer , really believed that the out@@ put of a flight has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about is mani@@ fest , you can mani@@ fest yourself .
so , what do we actually want to mani@@ fest -- an dis@@ ab@@ led person or a powerful person ?
in fact , a human being is less than calling a child , may be able to de@@ fe@@ at them and give them a belie@@ p@@ su@@ er .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open them with them ?
a human being opened for me do@@ ors was my pe@@ di@@ at@@ ri@@ cian at a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton in wil@@ v .
it &apos;s called dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o . a it@@ al@@ o-@@ american , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t be cor@@ rec@@ tly . so he &apos;s always been called dr. p@@ . .
and dr. p@@ . had a very shar@@ p fly and was just making kids with kids like this .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great , except for my physi@@ c@@ o therapy .
now , i had to repe@@ at a number of practic@@ es that seemed to be an infin@@ ite , el@@ a@@ stic be@@ w -- in different colors -- that &apos;s what i hat@@ ed to build my vo@@ cal mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed them more than anything else . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them .
and , as i say , i &apos;ve even been negoti@@ ated as a five-@@ year-old child with dr. p@@ .@@ s , and trying to stop these practic@@ es , naturally without success .
and one day , he was obser@@ ving me at one of my practic@@ es -- these practic@@ es were just ti@@ ring and gra@@ ce -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re such a strong , thi@@ ck and young girl , you &apos;re te@@ aring up one of those ball@@ s .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was , of course , just a simple trick of dr. p@@ . so i jo@@ ined the practic@@ es that i didn &apos;t want to be able to see with the rich@@ est five-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds in the hospital &apos;s hospital , but he actually led to see my daily hor@@ ror with new eyes , so it became a new and a lot of different experience .
and i wonder today how much his vision of me as an powerful and stron@@ ge@@ ful young girl has formed my own image and imag@@ ined to see myself as one of nature , powerful and at@@ le@@ th@@ an human .
this is just one example of many of the ways that adults can in@@ corpo@@ rate the imagination of a child .
but as we &apos;ve already obser@@ ved examples of syn@@ ony@@ ular dic@@ tion@@ aries , our language doesn &apos;t let us room , to imagine what we all want to do : to en@@ able each of us to see themselves as powerful people .
our language appe@@ ars to the socie@@ tal change that has been tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ed in lots of cases through a technologi@@ cal change .
at the medical stand@@ point , you can say , of course , my legs , the las@@ er surgery for visual dis@@ abilities that allow people to actually use all of their opportunities , to be able to define their own , to be able to define their own , to define their own , to define their own , and to ori@@ ent themselves to groups around the glo@@ be that they choose themselves for themselves to choose themselves .
so maybe this technical change reve@@ als clear than ever that every person in society can give you something special and very powerful , and that human ability to ada@@ pt is to ada@@ pt , our biggest plus is missing .
now , the human ability to ada@@ pt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me about wi@@ sts , and i &apos;m always very un@@ comfortable with telling you how to answer the questions of wi@@ dri@@ sts , and i think i &apos;m really un@@ comfortable with the questions of people to answer this ,
this sentence of eng@@ aging events lives by the idea that success or happiness depen@@ ded on a challenge without being affected by a pro@@ s@@ thetic experience , as if my life had been so successful , because i could percei@@ ve the possibility of a pro@@ s@@ thetic experience , or whatever people would percei@@ ve me with my dis@@ ability .
but the truth is that we change , of course , we are im@@ pac@@ ted , whether they physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally , or even both , is the other thing that &apos;s
and i &apos;d like to suggest that that &apos;s good .
there are no barri@@ ers that we have to cur@@ ge to get around in order to make better sense of our lives .
wi@@ va@@ tions just are just living to our lives .
and i tend to see wi@@ da@@ di@@ sts as my sha@@ dow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s har@@ dly seeing , but he &apos;s always on my own .
and i don &apos;t mean that ex@@ pos@@ ure to the effect , because the diffic@@ ality of the bat is de@@ dic@@ ated to a person .
there are more ambi@@ va@@ tions and challenges , and they &apos;re just all over the world , and every person &apos;s doing it differently , but the question is not whether we &apos;re hearing with ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence or not , but as we can get away with it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people we love to preser@@ ve in fa@@ vor of fa@@ kes , but to pre@@ p@@ are them to come well with it .
and we don &apos;t like our children if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t ada@@ pt themselves .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , and to other people &apos;s opini@@ on about whether i am dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
and in order to be honest , the only real and per@@ pe@@ tual dis@@ ability that i &apos;ve had to dis@@ agree with is that the world always thinks it can be able to describe me with those defini@@ tions .
in our desire to protect people who care about the heart and give them the cold , hard truth about their medical proje@@ ction , or to provide even a predi@@ ction to the quality of life that they &apos;re expe@@ cting to make sure that somebody is actually dis@@ ab@@ led to make sure that somebody is actually dis@@ ab@@ led .
perhaps this concept is a concept that &apos;s just about what &apos;s broken in one of them , and how we re@@ pair it for each individual is a greater dis@@ ability than the path@@ ology in itself .
if we don &apos;t treat a person who will not be attra@@ cted , not to recognize all its power@@ s and choices , we can also get to the natural fight that you may have to be able to do , another disease .
we de@@ gra@@ ce a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the patent and concent@@ rate us all around the field of human possibilities .
but the most important thing is that between the perception of our fail@@ ures and our beautiful ambi@@ ties , there is a connec@@ tivity .
we should not ab@@ ali@@ fy or den@@ y those shif@@ ts of times , or den@@ ial , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , but it &apos;s about finding them under the car@@ pet , but it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing in the wi@@ da@@ ging opportunities .
i think it &apos;s more likely to be clear that we don &apos;t necessarily have to over@@ come the fan@@ i@@ ties , but that we &apos;re open to thro@@ wing them in order to use them for a bat , to use a cro@@ und expression , and maybe even dan@@ cing with
and perhaps we manage to look at chimpanze@@ es as something natural , consi@@ der@@ able and useful and more useful to see us through their pres@@ ence , no longer that way
this year , we celebra@@ te the 200@@ th an@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ary of charles darwin , and when he has written about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has , in my view , in something very true in the human character .
i would re@@ write it like this : not survi@@ ving the tou@@ gh@@ est of its way , and not the most intelligent of his type , but the one that can be able to ada@@ pt to change .
it seems like confli@@ cts emer@@ ges .
not just from darwin &apos;s &apos;s work , we know that the capacity of humans to survive and to blo@@ wn up , is determin@@ ed by the struggle of the human mind to change through conflict .
so , again , change and adap@@ tation are the great sk@@ ill of the human being .
and maybe we even know where to be cut when we &apos;re actually being te@@ sted .
perhaps that &apos;s the point of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , a perception of the i@@ be , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that ourselves .
we can give ad@@ ju@@ sts to create a new meaning that &apos;s going on beyond the long run .
perhaps we can see te@@ a@@ va@@ tions as change .
dur@@ si@@ ties are a change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted yet yet .
and i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve ad@@ ded ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
hon@@ est@@ ly honest -- who &apos;s normal ?
there a@@ in &apos;t no normal way .
there &apos;s the usual one . the typical thing is , but not normal . and would you really want to know this poor , gra@@ y person if they really have to have it ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s rather likely .
it would be great if we could get this paradig@@ m of normal@@ ity to another of the possibility or strength , to make it even more dangerous , and invi@@ te them to the forces of lots of children , and invi@@ te them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
we &apos;ve found out that we &apos;ve always wonder@@ ed people from members of our society &apos;s members : being useful and contribu@@ ting to contribu@@ tion .
there &apos;s hin@@ ts of the ne@@ anderth@@ als of older people 6@@ 0,000 years ago and people with sever@@ e physical in@@ ju@@ ries , and that might have happened because life was more valuable in the survival of these people .
they didn &apos;t see these people as broken and they were us@@ eless ; they were being treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the town where i grew up into a food market in the nor@@ the@@ astern zone of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing there in front of a sh@@ re@@ ved to@@ ma@@ to to@@ ma@@ to .
and it was summer , and i had some goo@@ ts .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i turn around and i see this older man , and i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; exc@@ use me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re har@@ dly remem@@ ber@@ ing me .
when i first saw her , i brought her out of her mother &apos;s bel@@ ly . &quot;
oh , so that &apos;s the one .
and of course , it &apos;s made cli@@ ck .
and that was dr. ke@@ an , a man i knew only from narra@@ tives of my mom , because i was , of course , very typical , and i got late for two weeks .
the doctor for pr@@ ung@@ at@@ al diagno@@ stics was on ho@@ li@@ day , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born , i was born with them , and my feet had been re@@ je@@ cted after them , and i had just a few to@@ es on this one , and a pair of to@@ es on the other foot , and that stran@@ ger had to get the bad news out of it .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you were never going to walk , never be as b@@ old as other children or you could never live an independent life , and since then , they &apos;ve just given me to lie . &quot;
and what was really extraordinary to me was that he &apos;d colle@@ cted pieces of paper from my entire childhood , whether i &apos;d won my sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or one of my spor@@ ts se@@ ats at par@@ ade , whether i had a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship or one of my spor@@ ts to teach his students , medical students from the ha@@ ah medical school and the her@@ s@@ w medical school and her@@ s@@ hey medical school .
and he called this part of his cour@@ ses to the x factor , the potential of the human mind .
you can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze enough of how this factor can be for the quality of life of a person &apos;s life .
and dr. ke@@ an goes on and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t always get anything else , and even if you give children to their own , then children can do a lot of things . &quot;
you see , dr. ke@@ an &apos;s changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone car@@ es about it , are two different things .
and also , i changed my thinking in the course of the time when they asked me about 15 years old , whether i &apos;d tra@@ pped my pro@@ s@@ thetic stuff against legs and b@@ ones , then i wouldn &apos;t have e@@ sted a second .
i &apos;d like to make a normal time at the time .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure that much .
and that &apos;s what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
and perhaps this change could happen , because i &apos;ve been able to see so many people who have opened me do@@ ors , instead of changing people who con@@ stra@@ ined me or wan@@ ting to make a picture of a picture .
you see , it really needs only one person to mani@@ fest them how they can mani@@ fest their forces , and they &apos;re by .
if you can en@@ able someone to activ@@ ate your own inner power@@ s , the human mind is so stun@@ k -- if you can do that and you open a door for somebody in a critical moment , then you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they &apos;re going to get them to open up their own do@@ ors .
the meaning of the word &quot; radio &quot; is ro@@ ot@@ ed in the word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
it means controll@@ ing something that is in one , that it &apos;s just to ti@@ ck@@ le the potential .
so again , what are the potential that we want to leave now ?
and in the 196@@ 0s , one case of the u.k. was done one case in the u.k. , and then there were mand@@ al asia conver@@ ted in the entire schools .
they call it &quot; near dead &quot; in the united states , we call it &quot; the &quot; string &quot; . &quot;
the students are going to divi@@ de for notes .
and the a student , they &apos;re going to te@@ ar vi@@ ni@@ cally sever@@ e , they get better teachers and so on .
they then gave about a three-@@ month period of students with a &quot; ex@@ ternal word &quot; note , &quot; and they were very good . they were told they were very smart , and after those three months , they actually wrote really true .
and of course , it cr@@ as@@ hes you to hear the heart that the conver@@ gen@@ ce has been told to be told , only suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently enough .
and then it was like three months after the three months .
but only those who were still at school -- except from all the students who had stopped school .
but what was really cru@@ cial about this trial was that teachers weren &apos;t issu@@ ed .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were told that be the student students , and the student are enough with the note , and they &apos;ve been taught to give them something and treated them .
the only real dis@@ ability is a ho@@ st of a mind that has been broken , has no more hope , he doesn &apos;t find any more beautiful . it fe@@ e@@ ds our natural , early curi@@ osity , and our in@@ san@@ e capacity of the imagination .
but if we can get the human mind to support , continue to hope , ourselves and other people around themselves , are curious and imag@@ in@@ ative , and then we &apos;re putting our power@@ s into really posi@@ tively .
if there &apos;s a mind about these quali@@ ties , then we can create a new reality and new kind of reason .
i want to end with a po@@ em that was written by a per@@ si@@ an po@@ et called ha@@ fi@@ z in 14@@ th century , and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who knows only four words , not the god who knows only four words , and all the time repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly says , come with me , come with me , come with me , come with
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
as@@ sum@@ ing i said that , by a few changes of your genes , a better memory could have -- more pre@@ cise , more accu@@ rate and faster .
or , want to make more ner@@ der , be stron@@ ger , have more power .
would you like to become more attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ dent ?
what would it be like to live longer with good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always strug@@ gling for more creativity .
which one would you like them the most ?
which one would you like to have if you could just have one ?
creativity is .
how many people would choose to have creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see it .
a couple of them . probably , about as many as there are creative people .
it &apos;s extremely good .
how many would be for a good memory ?
there &apos;s a few more .
so how about fit@@ ness ?
a few lower things .
so , what about lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
oh , the majority . the king , i love , is a physi@@ c@@ ist .
if you could just have one of these , it would be a very different world .
is all all of this sing@@ ed ?
or is it possible , maybe ?
evolution has been a continu@@ ous theme here on the ted conference , but today i want to tell you a doctor &apos;s point of view .
the great gene@@ tics in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a comm@@ ant in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote a contra@@ ct that says , &quot; nothing in biology does not make any meaning except in the act of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of them who doesn &apos;t accept the pro@@ of of biological evolution , it would be a very good time to take your hearing monit@@ ors -- i give you per@@ mission -- and maybe you can take a gli@@ mp@@ se of the ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos; book that &apos;s about being wrong , because nothing else on this talk will make a sense of you .
but if you &apos;re accep@@ ting biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it true for others or is it true for us ?
so , this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i made a bus as a center of des@@ pair in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the order of the tree of life , all exi@@ sting fig@@ ures in evolutionary terms has been survi@@ ved ; they survi@@ ved ; it has demon@@ strated fit@@ ness and strength in evolutionary terms .
the human part of that bu@@ g , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re really interested in .
we &apos;ve dou@@ bled from a common ance@@ stry to modern chimpanze@@ es at about six or eight million years ago .
in that period of time , maybe there were 20 or 25 different var@@ ie@@ ties of hom@@ ini@@ ds .
some have come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re really dis@@ crimin@@ ate from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic mechanis@@ ms of our cells are quite similar to our cells .
do you realize that we can take advantage of this and inspi@@ re the mechanis@@ ms of a shared bacteri@@ um to produce the protein of the human insu@@ lin , which is used to treat diab@@ e@@ tic &apos;s hei@@ ghts ?
this is not like bra@@ insu@@ lin ; this is exactly the same protein that is chemical in@@ consi@@ stent of what comes out of the pan@@ crea@@ tic tra@@ cks .
and what we &apos;re talking about about bacteria is you &apos;re aware that each of us in our gut is going to lead more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many as that .
i mean , do you think that if ant@@ oni@@ o spea@@ ks for their self-@@ view , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful ho@@ st@@ y environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s ho@@ sti@@ le , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all nutri@@ ents that you could just wish to do without doing a job .
it &apos;s really a ligh@@ ter way for bacteria , with occasi@@ onal repres@@ ent@@ ations of un@@ inten@@ ded , je@@ od@@ ch forced to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like they &apos;re important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping essential nutri@@ ents to the di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to get in the future ?
are we in a form of evolutionary equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um in the form of a spe@@ z@@ ie ?
or are we sur@@ ely going to be something else -- something that &apos;s maybe better about the environment ?
let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first two to four billion years ago -- the first clu@@ es of living , maybe as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species that have been formed in the last 13@@ 0,000 years .
in this huge un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is just refle@@ cted in the earth , the animal king@@ dom , as a single subject , and of the human life , a small consumer re@@ duc@@ tion .
this is us .
this also inclu@@ des the entertain@@ ment value of this speech , so i hope you enjo@@ yed it .
now , when i was a gr@@ ute on college , i had my first biology clas@@ ses .
and i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ce and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution of evolution , and i pro@@ posed to myself , in most organisms , in most organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ated in both of these to@@ ol@@ -@@ five baby cells .
but at the time , as multi-@@ organisms emer@@ ged , things started to change .
so sexual re@@ production will go into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production , which gives the genome to the genome , the rest of the body is de@@ com@@ pl@@ ating .
in fact , you could say that the inevi@@ t@@ ability of death of our body in evolution seems to occu@@ p@@ y the same as sexual re@@ production .
now , i thought , if i was a college student , i thought , well , sex / death , sex , death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but it &apos;s coming to my older bran@@ ch .
and i came to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , who was introduced to his show in las v@@ eg@@ as , in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .
and one night , there &apos;s a s@@ hal@@ low s@@ hal@@ low on its hotel door .
it op@@ ens up the door .
he has a gor@@ ge@@ ous re@@ pos@@ it@@ ous sho@@ w@@ to@@ ys before him .
and she &apos;s looking at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ -@@ sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s amazing , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
i came to a reali@@ zation as a physi@@ cian that i was trying to do a dest@@ ination of what was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevi@@ table , just different .
i &apos;ve tried to preser@@ ve the body .
i wanted to keep our own healthy .
i wanted to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le health after illness .
i wanted us to get a long and healthy life alive .
evolution is everything about the whole generation of the genome to the next generation , adap@@ tation and survival generation after generation .
so from an evolutionary stand@@ point , they and i and i are developing like bo@@ y@@ qui@@ es to send the genetic fra@@ c@@ ture into the next level of the orbit , so they can then fall out into the ocean .
i think we all would all understand the mo@@ od , the ki@@ dy allen , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get im@@ ca@@ z@@ ence through my work .
i don &apos;t want to be dying by dying . &quot;
evolution does not necessarily mean to pre@@ fer the lon@@ gest life .
it &apos;s not inevi@@ table to the biggest , the tou@@ gh@@ est or the fa@@ il@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
evolution pri@@ mar@@ i@@ zes the creatures that are best adap@@ ted to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survi@@ ving survival and success .
there are bacteria at the bottom of the ocean that are ther@@ mo@@ op@@ hi@@ l , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to the best dam@@ h groups otherwise , if fish were there , it would have vac@@ u@@ um fish for themselves , they &apos;ve managed to make a resi@@ stance environment .
so , what does that mean when we look back , what happens in evolution and how we think about people in evolution , and most of all , how do we look forward to the next stage , i would say that there are a number of opportunities .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to continue to develop .
we &apos;ve reach@@ ed some form of balance .
and the reason that it would be that , first of all , it &apos;s taken us through medicine , managed to get a lot of genes that had been sent to each other and have been re@@ moved from the population .
and second , we as a species that shapes us in such a way that we managed to ada@@ pt to us proper@@ ly , and to ada@@ pt them to them .
and by the way , we migra@@ te and we run and we mix so much that they can &apos;t say that isol@@ ation is necessary , for the evolution to find stat@@ en@@ tic@@ ing .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of the traditional species , of course , im@@ posed from nature &apos;s forces .
and the argument here , though , is that the whe@@ els of evolution are rapi@@ dly bene@@ ficial , but they &apos;re in@@ tru@@ tent .
and so far the isol@@ ation is , if we change a species remote planet , it will be isol@@ ated , and the change of the environment that evolution can produce in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a re@@ fin@@ ing , intri@@ gu@@ ing possibility , an en@@ vel@@ op@@ ing possibility .
what i call it is ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new evolution that isn &apos;t just natural , but it led us and sel@@ ec@@ ting us as an individual in the decisions that we make .
now , how could this happen ?
so , how could it be that we do this ?
consider , let &apos;s look at the reality that people now are doing , in some cultures , about their off@@ spring today .
they are , in some cultures , the choices to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what &apos;s going to deter@@ mine the one and the family
so if you think about it , if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to give genetic custom@@ ies to the body that would he@@ al and prevent disease .
what if they could be the genetic changes to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or reduce the risk of cancer or the stro@@ ke of the skin ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to be able to make these changes in your genes ?
when we &apos;re looking at this , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it la@@ sted 13 years .
and it cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
the next year , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dr@@ one to four months .
today , they can compe@@ te a sequence of three billion base pa@@ irs of the human genome to a price of about 20@@ ,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time , until the reality will be the 1,000 of human genome , and it &apos;s going to be increasingly available to anyone .
a week ago , in the national acade@@ my of the national acade@@ my of engineering , the wir@@ eless prize for fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem u@@ mmer , two scientists who have developed indepen@@ dence to work faster and to lead to a more efficient way -- which fran@@ ces ar@@ ni@@ old called &quot; direct evolution &quot; -- which is called &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the las@@ ist prize was awar@@ ded to the scientists of sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took a grow@@ ri@@ po@@ ac@@ ous animal , a fi@@ bro@@ sti@@ sts , and by manipu@@ lation of only four genes , poten@@ tially , to be able to do any cell in your body , poten@@ tially in order
these changes are in the way .
the same technology that &apos;s produced the human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just prote@@ cting prote@@ cting their own , but can also serve to imm@@ unity for other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study with v@@ acc@@ ine against influ@@ enz@@ a that has been built into the cells of a to@@ bac@@ co plant .
can you imagine some kind of good that &apos;s made of to@@ bac@@ co ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , it will be much more possible .
so think about just two other small changes of changes .
so you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your global change ?
what if they could change the sper@@ m and eg@@ g cells to give their children better for a heal@@ ter of heal@@ thi@@ er life -- elimin@@ ating the cro@@ vi@@ op@@ hi@@ xes , re@@ move the risk of the gl@@ o@@ op@@ ity , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be heal@@ thi@@ er ?
and then analy@@ tic engineering , the same engine , the same engine of science can en@@ able us to prevent disease , could also be able to adop@@ t hi@@ p super@@ -@@ at@@ ster , hyper@@ -@@ capacity -- better memory -- better memory .
why don &apos;t the ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ment of a c@@ and@@ le h@@ ul@@ l , especially if you can exp@@ and it with the next generation of wat@@ ny machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ ber that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why no longer you live ?
these are going to be in@@ her@@ ently resi@@ stant .
and when we &apos;re at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want to be trans@@ formed by al@@ alt style evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we will have a process that usually requires 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it at a thousand years -- and maybe , for the next 100 years .
these are decisions that have their grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , they need to deal with them .
are we using these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , the more successful that is friend@@ ly ?
or will we sel@@ ec@@ tively choose different at@@ tribu@@ tes we want for some of us , and not for any other one ?
are we going to be different to a society of di@@ vor@@ ced and uni@@ form@@ ist , or ro@@ zz@@ ster and multi@@ rop@@ es ?
these are the kinds of questions that we &apos;re going to be about to meet .
and the deep@@ est of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom of ma@@ sters that we &apos;re going to need to make these decisions ?
in good way like bad , and previ@@ ously , as you might think , these decisions are about us .
why thank you .
what i want you to do now is introdu@@ ce you to a port@@ able robot that gives you sur@@ ve@@ yo@@ p@@ y , or another , the wheel@@ chair dri@@ vers helps to stand up and go back to it .
we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics call these robot ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
they &apos;re nothing other than something that you put in the morning and give them extra strength , and that will increase their speed , and will help you keep your balance for example , for example .
in fact , that &apos;s the real waste of human and machine .
but not just that -- it &apos;s mer@@ ging and conne@@ cting to the universe and other devices out there .
and this isn &apos;t just a crazy idea .
so to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about talking about the american soldiers on average , about 100 pounds on the average , and it &apos;s a question that they should carry more equipment .
now , of course , this leads to some significant compli@@ cations -- spin@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of that -- exponenti@@ al spin@@ al in@@ ju@@ ries .
so we thought that we would embra@@ ce this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introdu@@ ce you to h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human@@ -@@ universal car@@ rier .
sol@@ d@@ at : with the h@@ ul@@ c@@ -@@ ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can wear 200 pounds across a range of different ter@@ rain , for many hours .
its flexi@@ ble design allows you to lower down , to pro@@ hi@@ bit , to pro@@ mote rich and meaning@@ ful movement , right ?
it feels what i want to leave where i want to go , and then i grow my strength and exten@@ se it .
we &apos;re so far to introdu@@ ce our industrial part@@ ners to imagine this machine , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on in this year .
so , it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s now take our view of wheel@@ chair dri@@ vers , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 6@@ 8 million people who are esti@@ ma@@ ted in a wheel@@ chair in the world .
that &apos;s appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely one percent of the population population .
and this is indeed a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ mate .
we &apos;ve often been talking about very young people with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ ju@@ ries that have been , in the s@@ ale of their life -- &apos; 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- the dest@@ in@@ y of the wheel@@ chair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose number has been multi@@ pli@@ ed .
and as much as the only option -- if it &apos;s going to be a sk@@ ill , or for other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
and so , for the way , it has been for 500 years since i &apos;ve got to say , very successful introdu@@ ction .
so we thought that we could start to write an entirely new chap@@ ter in the state of mo@@ bility .
now , let me introdu@@ ce you to elegan@@ gs that will be car@@ ried by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel , who suff@@ ered in a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury , which made a result that she couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years now and so far .
thank you very much .
like i said , am@@ anda be@@ w our eleph@@ ant .
it &apos;s got sensor@@ s .
his completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ y sensor@@ s in the re@@ je@@ ction , sending back signals to our on@@ bo@@ ar@@ d computer , which is atta@@ ched to here on their back .
now , here &apos;s bat@@ ter@@ y pac@@ k@@ ings , which is the engine of the car , just like the k@@ nee of your k@@ ne@@ es that you move forward in this rather smo@@ oth and very natural floor .
i was 24 years old and in a significant form , when a mon@@ wave tree was dra@@ wn to p@@ ink tree while i was dra@@ wn to a sk@@ i stri@@ p .
in a second of a second , i lost every sen@@ sation , and every movement underneath my own be@@ ck@@ is .
not long time after a doctor in my hospital room , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you will never leave again . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s sp@@ inning every five of the five hope from my consciousness .
adap@@ t@@ able technologies , i &apos;ve been able to learn to go back , clim@@ b , clim@@ b and even go to the hands of the whe@@ el .
but nothing was invented that was going to leave me all the way to now .
thank you very much .
as you can see , we &apos;ve got the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet and to disc@@ uss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here and all the wheel@@ cha@@ gen , but for all .
thank you very much .
home in new york , i &apos;m a head of the development department of a non@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin entrepr@@ es@@ man .
if i don &apos;t eat poverty , i fi@@ re as a fire@@ fi@@ f@@ er of a fire@@ man &apos;s head in a volunte@@ er tr@@ us@@ kee@@ per .
well , in our city , in the volunte@@ er of volunte@@ ers who suppor@@ ted a highly trained professional service service , you have to be pretty early at the br@@ ush to be able to com@@ bine .
so , i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunte@@ er for the br@@ ank , so i was quite a good opportunity to be able to get there .
but still , there was a race to get the other volunte@@ ers to reach auth@@ ori@@ ties and figure out what our techni@@ tions would be .
when i found the main man , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the home of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , which definitely had one of the worst days of their life .
it was the middle of the night , and she stood in the car@@ v@@ y@@ ards and bar@@ e@@ foot under a screen outside the rain , while her house was coming in fl@@ ames .
the other volunte@@ ers who came across in front of me -- let &apos;s call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- made him first , and were asked to go to the house and to save the dog &apos;s dog as@@ s@@ ert .
the dog is ! i was missing out of date .
there was any law@@ yer or den@@ ial auth@@ ori@@ ties who now was able to tell people that he went into a burning house to save a living cre@@ ature , just because he was faster for five seconds faster than i did .
well , i was the next one .
the main man fle@@ w up to me .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you &apos;ve got to go to the house .
you &apos;ve got to go up , on fire , and you &apos;ve got to get a pair of shoes to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swe@@ ar to it .
now , not exactly what i hop@@ ed to do , i went to -- i went to -- the sta@@ irs went up , the hall@@ way , to the true fire@@ men , which at that moment had been done with the ge@@ a@@ pers , to get a pair of shoes to get a pair of shoes .
now , i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i put my pre@@ y back down to the bottom where i met my ne@@ cker and the lo@@ ving dog .
we were putting our as@@ pi@@ ration out to the home@@ maker , where , not surpris@@ ingly , were able to get more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the fire@@ man got a letter of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , where she car@@ ed about the ru@@ ff@@ er as@@ sign@@ ment for saving her house .
one of the most valu@@ ed kin@@ dness : somebody was actually pus@@ hed a pair of shoes to them .
in both of my prof@@ ession , ro@@ bin leadership and my next prof@@ ession as volunte@@ er fi@@ ghter is i wit@@ ness from gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness in lar@@ gely scale , but i also see the acts of one of the stran@@ gers and the mu@@ c@@ ant of individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned to you ?
they &apos;re all important .
and so , if i look around people in this room and see people who have either come to succe@@ ed or stay on their way here , i &apos;d like to offer this memory : they don &apos;t pay the following .
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in somebody else until you &apos;ve reach@@ ed your first one million .
if you have something to give you , they give it a now .
use them in an ocean ta@@ tic , put it on a door in the neighborhood .
be a ment@@ or . &quot;
not every day will give us an opportunity to save people &apos;s lives , but every day allows us the opportunity to change one .
so they &apos;re going to put them out . save the shoes .
thank you very much .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mark , come back to this .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ve just come back from a community that knows the secret of the sub@@ su@@ gen@@ ce of humanity .
it &apos;s a place where women do the cop@@ ter with sex &apos; 8 , and play the day -- where pa@@ ys is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not a sing@@ man or san francisco .
ladies and gentle@@ men , their rela@@ tions .
this is the world of the wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s at the fore@@ forest of con@@ go .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are together with chimpanze@@ es and our clo@@ s@@ est living rela@@ tives .
this means we have a common ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , that lived about six million years ago .
now , ch@@ im@@ ps are known for their produ@@ ces .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve over@@ looked this aspe@@ ct of human evolution in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show the other side of the me@@ d@@ al side of the
as chimpanze@@ es of large , fear of dis@@ car@@ ding ker@@ bs , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ al society will be led to em@@ power@@ ed fe@@ o@@ bo@@ o society .
they were really out there , because this leads to an out@@ put of a volunte@@ er society where the le@@ th@@ al violence had not been noticed before .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least known among the pri@@ mates .
they live in the dep@@ th of the con@@ gol@@ ese ar@@ forest of the con@@ gol@@ ese ar@@ forest , and they &apos;re just hard to obser@@ ve obser@@ vation .
the con@@ go is a parado@@ x -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the emergen@@ cy of a violent argument that has so@@ sted for decades and has requ@@ est@@ ed as many lives as world war ii .
it &apos;s not surprising that the destruction of the destruction will also be the survival of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@
so meat co@@ ap@@ s , and the dec@@ line of the cycle , therefore , is that you can &apos;t even fill a sta@@ dium with the associated bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear go@@ od@@ b@@ ye to the fact that the trees sh@@ out .
so who are these related relative ?
we think of it as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have a tenden@@ cy , too , bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , with inter@@ active part@@ ners , and rules like that and social security companies are .
now , i &apos;m not saying this would be the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because the life of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s consi@@ sts of more than the cam@@ a su@@ tra .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like humans -- love to play their lives for their lives .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children games .
for us , and it &apos;s a basic fundamental thing for the atta@@ ch@@ ment of relationships and care for toler@@ ance .
and in doing that , we &apos;re learning and the rules of the game .
play incre@@ ases creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of different kinds of com@@ pounds , variety of com@@ pounds .
and when you watch bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s at play , you see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human la@@ s@@ ses , dance and ritu@@ als .
play is the be@@ t that teach@@ es us .
now , i don &apos;t know how they &apos;re playing , but i want to show you some unique foot@@ age in the wild right now .
first of all , bon@@ o@@ bo type -- and i don &apos;t think of soc@@ o@@ bo in this process .
so what we see here is a young female and male in a re@@ plac@@ ement game .
look at what it does .
this could be the evolutionary orig@@ in of it , &quot; she puts it in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
it &apos;s just that i think it &apos;s more like that , not true .
yeah !
so , the sex games are sel@@ ec@@ ted , both in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and in humans as well .
and this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea of the idea of making new elements in the game -- like the te@@ stes -- and also how the game dem@@ ands trust and nur@@ turing -- as at the same time , fun is going to be extremely fun .
but the game is a form of sculp@@ ture .
play is a sculp@@ ture , and it can take lots of shapes , some of which are kind of quie@@ t , imagination , curious -- maybe to discover the ama@@ z@@ ari@@ ous again .
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she plays pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful with water .
and i think , just like you are playing , sometimes we play alone , and we d@@ ele@@ te our inter@@ ior and ex@@ pos@@ ure worl@@ ds .
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that makes us explor@@ ed , and interact , and the un@@ expected lin@@ tations that we create are really the nutri@@ ent fe@@ eding of creativity .
this is just a little taste of looking at the gli@@ mp@@ ses , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , to us in our past and right .
but they also succe@@ e@@ se a secret for our future , a future in which we have to ada@@ pt to increasing challenges , from greater creativity and print am@@ en@@ sive co@@ operation .
the secret is that the key to this task is the key to this sk@@ ill .
in other words , play is our adap@@ t@@ le@@ ar jo@@ ker .
to give us a very in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best of our play@@ craft ?
play isn &apos;t h@@ arb@@ or@@ ming .
but it &apos;s essential .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans , life is not from the teeth and cla@@ ws alone .
especially when it &apos;s har@@ dly har@@ dly appropriate , games may be the most needed .
and therefore , my pri@@ mate mus@@ sel@@ s , let &apos;s embra@@ ce this gift of evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , and re@@ discover the wonder .
why thank you .
so , i want you to introdu@@ ce two pa@@ irs , middle of 197@@ 9 , exactly exactly the same day , every single thing , every single baby . okay .
so two pa@@ irs , each is a baby &apos;s cre@@ am .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time , because , if you introdu@@ ce the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
just think of that for a moment .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , you can imagine , in a case , the sper@@ ma wearing a y ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ m hit@@ ting the x chromo@@ some of the ice .
and in the other case , the sper@@ ma carrying a x chromo@@ some that hits the x of chromo@@ some in the ice .
both of them are alive , both of the light .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people later .
i &apos;ve got two hat@@ s in most of my activi@@ ties .
under a ca@@ p , i &apos;m involved with the history of an@@ atom@@ y .
i &apos;m a study histor@@ ian , and in this case , i study how people went around with an@@ atom@@ y -- that means human bodies , animal bodies -- as they were dealing with body flu@@ ids , as they thought about bodies .
the other hat i &apos;ve taken with my work is the activ@@ ist , as a patient leader -- or , as i sometimes say , as im@@ patient law@@ yers -- of people who are patients of physi@@ cians .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people , the body guys , to question the social nor@@ ms .
so for example , i worked with people , for example , who are si@@ am@@ ese tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with c@@ ler@@ s -- which is people who were smaller than usual .
and i &apos;ve been working very often with inter@@ sexual people , whose gender is at@@ yp@@ cally -- so people who don &apos;t consider the average male or female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the word inter@@ sexu@@ ality for that .
inter@@ sexu@@ ality occur@@ s in lots of different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the possible type of sexual vari@@ ants that don &apos;t inclu@@ de the male or the female standard .
in a case , you might have somebody with a x@@ y chromo@@ some base , and the s@@ ars of y ch@@ om@@ o@@ som@@ s grab@@ s the proto@@ performance that we all have in the sta@@ va@@ tal sta@@ dium to grow up .
and that &apos;s why the te@@ stes give off in the fe@@ atures of the colors of the life .
but because this individual is missing the re@@ cep@@ tors to see the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one re@@ act , the body does not respond to the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and that &apos;s called and@@ ro@@ se re@@ cep@@ tor@@ y de@@ fe@@ ct .
so , a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to that .
as a con@@ sequence of the body , the body evol@@ ves more and more female pro@@ gressi@@ vely .
when the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being educ@@ ated as a girl .
but most time , until it reach@@ es pu@@ ber@@ ty and grow their brothers and develop , they don &apos;t get their peri@@ o@@ l until somebody comes to it , until somebody comes to it .
and they do a few tests , and they find that instead of eg@@ w@@ ling and nur@@ turing , they &apos;re ho@@ sti@@ le , and they &apos;re having a y chromo@@ some .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could still hold this person as a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies that you call ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ sen .
they &apos;re in the back@@ y@@ ard of our body .
and then the side kid@@ ney see@@ ms , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
most of the women , like me -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromo@@ hi , but i think most women like me are actually talking on and@@ ro@@ gens .
we produce and@@ ro@@ ys , and we &apos;re talking to and@@ ro@@ gens .
the con@@ sequence is that somebody like me actually had a brain that was de@@ dic@@ ated to more and@@ ro@@ ys than a woman who was born with mom , and a and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ship re@@ cep@@ tor@@ er .
so , gender is really complicated ; inter@@ sexual is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a way , in a sense , they can be distribu@@ ted across the band@@ wid@@ th .
here &apos;s another example : a few years ago , i got the phone call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , he had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend as a man , and he had just discovered that he had o@@ er@@ sti@@ cks and an u@@ ter@@ oni@@ an mom .
he had an extreme form of an in@@ na@@ te final ni@@ er@@ en@@ c@@ liche hyper@@ bla@@ king .
he &apos;s got x@@ x chromo@@ some , and he &apos;s in the wom@@ b , his side kid@@ ney was so active that essentially , they &apos;ve created a male hor@@ m@@ one surro@@ und .
and as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ arian was ex@@ posed to male , his brain was the typical male part of the hor@@ m@@ one spec@@ tra@@ l .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one had an a@@ er@@ ial thing .
it wasn &apos;t until he got 19 years old , really , he got enough medical issues , actually , because he worried that the doctors found out that he was in the position that he was in it .
okay , just a quick example of a vari@@ ation of inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , they &apos;re developing something called o@@ cl@@ est@@ is , where o@@ vari@@ an tissue is turned out of ho@@ g tissue .
we don &apos;t quite know why this is happening .
so , gender can occu@@ r in lots of different vari@@ ants .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s in@@ struc@@ tional or si@@ am@@ ese tw@@ ins , it &apos;s sex@@ ually ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed -- sur@@ ely -- sur@@ ely , surge@@ ons are custom@@ i@@ zed to the nor@@ m , is not because it &apos;s for their physical health of advan@@ tages .
in a lot of these cases , these people are totally healthy .
the reason why they &apos;ve been able to do different kinds of sur@@ gical surgery is because they thre@@ aten to thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain an@@ atom@@ ic exchange of dealing with a particular identity will go .
so we have the concept of being a woman , is to have a female identity , is to be a black person , name , to have an african an@@ atom@@ y in terms of their own story .
so we &apos;ve got this horri@@ ble simpli@@ stic idea .
and when we &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a body that &apos;s actually very different for us , it &apos;s kind of conf@@ used for us , in terms of that categ@@ ory .
so we &apos;ve got a lot of roman@@ tic ideas in our culture , in our culture .
and our nation is really based on a very roman@@ tic notion of individu@@ alism .
now , you can imagine what a@@ wes@@ ome it is when children are born , the two people in the body are born .
where i had personally experienced most of the time was the south east run@@ ch ca@@ ster in ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , whose gender was challen@@ ged in the lei@@ ch@@ at@@ le@@ op@@ ology world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship in ber@@ lin .
and many journ@@ alists call me the question , &quot; what pun@@ t@@ led you are going to do to tell us whether ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya &apos;s var@@ der or male is ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists that there was no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that nature is dra@@ wn to us between male and female and more sex@@ ally and more sex@@ ally and more sex@@ ally reli@@ ment@@ ally , but we &apos;re the ones who pre@@ fer that line of the line as natural .
so we have this situation where , the further science pro@@ gr@@ esses our science , we must be aware of so much more , that these categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve de@@ dic@@ ated to very simple in@@ struc@@ tions to create perman@@ ent identity ima@@ ging , are much more in@@ cu@@ tin@@ ous than we as@@ sig@@ ned to .
and that &apos;s not just related to gender .
it also invol@@ ves race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has allowed .
when we looked at our vie@@ ws , we were in all kinds of in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent areas .
we pro@@ pose , for example , that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es .
so what we &apos;re going to do with the fact is that we can dist@@ ingu@@ ish ourselves with a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des of mine ?
as we continue to push our science forward , we get increasingly into a zone of dis@@ comfort where we have to recognize that the lo@@ gic categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve probably had are very easy to do .
we see it in all sorts of different parts of the human life .
one of the areas that we see that to the website , in our culture today , in today &apos;s united states , are the strug@@ gles of the beginning and the end of life .
we &apos;ve got a difficult conversation about what &apos;s going to be a human body at what &apos;s going to be a human being , so that it &apos;s a different right than the fe@@ tus .
we no@@ wa@@ days have very difficult argu@@ ments no@@ wa@@ days -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about when somebody is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight with the question when somebody was dead .
they would have someone who kept a fe@@ a@@ ther under the nose , and when they moved , they hadn &apos;t bu@@ ried them yet .
if she doesn &apos;t move anymore , you bu@@ ried it .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we can take people &apos;s life@@ -@@ important organs and want to raise them other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re starting to fight at the fight with the really difficult question when somebody is dead , and this brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have that simple categ@@ ories of categ@@ ories like before .
now , you might assu@@ me that this whole collap@@ sing of categ@@ ories would be like me really happy to make .
i &apos;m poli@@ tically pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i &apos;m defen@@ ding people with unusual bodies , but i &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit , it &apos;s nervous to me .
to realize that these categ@@ ories are really much more inse@@ cure than we thought we were going to make it atta@@ ched
and it makes me sus@@ p@@ ly in terms of consi@@ der@@ ing democra@@ cies .
so to tell you about that inten@@ tion , first of all , i &apos;ve got to say that i &apos;m a big fan of fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
i know they were ra@@ king , i know they were ne@@ xi@@ est , but they were terri@@ fic .
i think that they were so bra@@ ll@@ er and strong , and so radical , in which they carry me to watch the rapi@@ s@@ ful impro@@ v@@ ements in 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten to forget .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
and the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were , in my view , the ini@@ tial an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why .
what they came back was an an@@ atom@@ ic concept , and they put it through another that was radi@@ cally and beautiful , and 200 years for us was so much .
as you all remember , our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y emer@@ ged in a very simpli@@ fied concept of an@@ atom@@ y , right ?
the ancient world poli@@ cies didn &apos;t have an idea based on the dna , but they had a concept of the birth right .
they had a concept of blue pal@@ m .
they were the notion that people who had political power should have this political power , because of the dist@@ ant blood line from the grand@@ father to father and so forth .
so the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers pro@@ posed this idea and put them through a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all humans have been equ@@ ally created equ@@ ally .
they were ni@@ vel@@ ing the play@@ field , and decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , they were seeing common@@ ic numbers , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made this part , because they were part of an el@@ der@@ able system where there were two things that were growing in common .
democracy was growing up , but at the same time , science was growing .
if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , it turns out that a lot of you were very interested in science , and you were interested in a concept of a natural world .
they went out of the terms of over@@ natural species , and re@@ gar@@ ding things like a super@@ natural idea of power , back where the trans@@ mission on a very awful sense of birth is based on birth .
and they moved into a reali@@ stic concept .
and , of course , if you look at the dec@@ lar@@ ation of indepen@@ dence , talking about nature and the god of nature .
you &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature around us to tell us who we are .
and , as part of that , they gave us an idea of the an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ s .
and they &apos;ve prepared them , in a really wonderful way , the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it that way , but what they &apos;ve done for us was great .
so what &apos;s years after that ?
for example , women used the vot@@ ing right , the concept of fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , which says that an@@ atom@@ ic related is more important than the an@@ atom@@ ic difference , and said , &quot; that we should not have the ability to have the right to have a full citi@@ zen@@ ship of citi@@ zen@@ ship , to have quite ow@@ ner@@ ship , etc , etc . &quot;
and women argu@@ ed that success@@ fully .
next , the successful civil rights movement , where we looked at people like so@@ vie@@ ded songs , who sp@@ in about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the mar@@ ro@@ wing hall@@ s of the country , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people who live in different skin colors that go on to an@@ atom@@ ic sett@@ le@@ ments of an@@ atom@@ ic differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing with dis@@ ab@@ led rights .
now the problem is that , as we start to look at all the common ways , we have to start asking about why we &apos;re main@@ tain@@ ing a certain separ@@ ations .
now , being well-@@ inten@@ ded , i &apos;d like to re@@ tain certain separ@@ ations , or an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
for example , i want to give you a fish of the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take off the an@@ atom@@ y quite distance .
i don &apos;t want to say that five year-@@ ol@@ ds have the right to be able to make sure to give you a little bit of sex or to mar@@ ry them .
so there are a few an@@ atom@@ ical separ@@ ations that make sense to me , and i think that i should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out who it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaning@@ ful .
so let &apos;s move back to those two cre@@ ature that have been announ@@ ced in the beginning of the talk .
we have two beings , both mi@@ d-@@ in the middle of 197@@ 9 , in exactly the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia , three months , was born , so it &apos;s born by jun@@ e 1@@ 80 .
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , gets born to the birthday , so he &apos;s born on one of the 19@@ 80 , in 19@@ 80 .
because of the fact that mar@@ ia was born 3 months , they get born all the possible rights for three months before h@@ ein@@ -@@ rich -- having the fairly embar@@ ras@@ sed sex to choose the right .
h@@ ein@@ gi@@ an needs to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the time of his birth .
we find other kind of od@@ di@@ ties about what their rights are .
h@@ ein@@ rich , because you think it &apos;s male -- although i &apos;m not telling you that he &apos;s male , he can now get dra@@ wn in , you can now get dra@@ wn in , which mar@@ ia does not have to worry about .
mar@@ ia hin@@ ge can &apos;t percei@@ ve the same ex@@ act states , the h@@ ein@@ ri@@ ty in all states , to mar@@ ry the right .
hun@@ tur@@ ty can mar@@ ry a woman in every state , but mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman in a few states today .
so we have this perman@@ ent an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ory that &apos;s relevant in many ways , in many ways , proble@@ matic and questi@@
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science that we &apos;re going to do in the field of an@@ atom@@ y is to make a point where we have to ad@@ v@@ ance a democracy where we have a democracy that &apos;s going on to an@@ atom@@
now , i don &apos;t want to leave the science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels as though the science is affec@@ ting itself .
so , where do we go ?
it seems as if our culture will be a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic stance , &quot; okay , we need to draw a line somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are tra@@ pped in a very strange position .
so for instance , texas , at one point , had decided to mar@@ ry a man saying you didn &apos;t have y chromo@@ some and mar@@ ry a woman means you &apos;ve got a y chromo@@ some .
now , in practice , people don &apos;t te@@ sted on their chromo@@ some .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re , because of the history i &apos;ve told you about the and@@ ro@@ gen@@ ian re@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
so if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he gives us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution to us .
he &apos;s saying we shouldn &apos;t be asked to ju@@ dge people for their skin color , but after the fe@@ der@@ ality of their character , they go out of such an@@ atom@@ y .
and i &apos;d like to say , &quot; yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
now , how do you do that in practice ?
how do you ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate people based on their characteri@@ stic ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribu@@ te right in terms of human beings , because i have to ad@@ mit that i don &apos;t know i know a variety of golden re@@ tri@@ dge , which probably deser@@ ves more than some of the people i know .
now , i want you to know that i &apos;m probably going to know some of the high@@ way lab dogs , which are more capable , more smart and more smart decisions to meet their sexual relationships than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds i know .
so , how are we going to focus on the question of the characteri@@ ties of the character ?
it turns out it turns out to be a really hard way .
and a part of myself wonder@@ ed , what if the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts of a person@@ ality would be something that would be available in the future -- could be made by f@@ mr@@ i visible ?
do we really want to go in that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going to go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is deci@@ ding to think about democracy in terms of democracy .
we &apos;ve done a really good job in our effort by democracy , and i think we &apos;re doing a good job of what we &apos;re doing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for instance , where a man is dra@@ wn to other men with death , because it &apos;s about to contribu@@ te to other men because he &apos;s willing to contribu@@ te to a gender re@@ transformation , in which case he can re@@ main alive .
we don &apos;t exist in these kinds of conditions .
and i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surge@@ on that i spoke a few of the gy@@ am@@ ese tw@@ ins to separate it , to separate them , to make a name .
but when i was resear@@ ching his tele@@ phone , and he asked him why he made this interven@@ tion -- it was high oper@@ ations -- it was his response that , in his country , these children were going to be very poor treated , and so they had to do it .
and i ans@@ wer@@ ed him , &quot; now they &apos;ve moved poli@@ tically as@@ yl@@ um instead of having a surgery to separate it ? &quot;
the united states provi@@ des un@@ belie@@ vable opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are , without having to change themselves by the state .
and so i think we need to be leaders .
all right , just to conclu@@ de , i &apos;ll tell you that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fa@@ thers .
and i want to think about the possibility of what democracy might look like , or may have seen if we had more and looked at the mothers more .
and i want to say something that &apos;s radical for a fe@@ min@@ ist thing , and i think that there may be different ways that there might be opini@@ ons of different kinds of an@@ atom@@ y , specifically when people are using group thinking .
for years , for years , i &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sexu@@ ality , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in gender , in terms of research
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- more than that , complex social rela@@ tions and the security of people that are vulnerable to the group of people who are vulnerable to a lot of attention .
and so , when we think about that , we have an interesting situation ahead of us
years ago , when i went to graduate school , i asked myself one of my students who knew my interest in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i looked at myself as a fe@@ min@@ ist thing , which was what really -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the fe@@ min@@ ism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the du@@ m@@ b question i &apos;ve ever heard .
fe@@ min@@ ism is about solving viruses about gender , which is why fe@@ min@@ ism reli@@ es on fe@@ min@@ ism .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought there might be a little bit more fe@@ min@@ ine about fe@@ min@@ ism .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , with female brains of male dist@@ ingu@@ ishing , which helps us to do extremely complex social rela@@ tions and provide care for the protection of the shel@@ ter .
so , for example , where the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were extremely accu@@ rate to figure out how individuals could be prote@@ cted before the state , we would be able to get more concep@@ t@@ ful about this concept , and not just how to protect , but how we can rel@@ ate to each other .
and perhaps that &apos;s where we feel in the future when we do democracy about an@@ atom@@ y -- less about the individual bodies thinking about identity , thinking more about relationships , thinking more about relationships .
so that , when people are trying to do a perfect connection , we can think about what we can do for each other .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obs@@ essed with out@@ f@@ are .
and i love to find a different color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit , and photograph , and photograph , in a while , and blog@@ ging .
but i &apos;m not going to buy anything new .
i &apos;ve got all my clo@@ th@@ es out of my second hand on fle@@ w markets and in england cell sh@@ ops .
o@@ oh , thank you very much .
the camera hand@@ -@@ sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact of my temp@@ l on the environment , and also to my pur@@ se exchange .
i meet all kinds of amazing people ; my dollars is usually a good purpose ; and i look quite unique , and it &apos;s making a lot of pur@@ ch@@ ase to my very personal clo@@ th@@ es .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my hei@@ ght ?
am i going to like the color ?
isn &apos;t it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
when all the answers are l@@ oud , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i &apos;m going to come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and tell you what i &apos;ve put for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone bring out with so many out@@ f@@ its ?
so , i &apos;ll show you exactly what i brought with you .
i brought seven seconds with under@@ pants , and that &apos;s all .
for just a week , everything i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case is all i &apos;ve done .
i was trou@@ bled that i would be able to find anything i might wear if i came to pal@@ m spr@@ ings at once .
and since they haven &apos;t heard about me as the woman that &apos;s going around here at ted in their under@@ wear -- it means that i found a few things .
and i want to introdu@@ ce you to my out@@ f@@ are for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i believe it or not , from those ad@@ vent@@ ure has learned to wear anything new .
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
i call that the b@@ essen@@ y@@ fish tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money in order to look good .
you can almost think of great than 50 dollars for less than 50 dollars .
all this out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket inclu@@ ded me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece i &apos;ve had to wear in this entire week .
mon@@ day : color is a little po@@ tent thing .
it &apos;s almost physi@@ cally impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing coffee red ho@@ ses .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re ri@@ pping other people happy people .
tu@@ es@@ day : adap@@ tation is extremely over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , and to ada@@ pt myself at the same time .
just be the one who you are .
if they surro@@ und themselves with the right people , they &apos;re not only going to understand it , they will also esti@@ mate it .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i think , like i &apos;ll play , or i remember your se@@ ven@@ -year-old &apos;s time .
i like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re going to look good in something , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re in a bad way , you &apos;re probably right , you &apos;re probably right .
i was born with a mom who was teaching me the day for day .
but it wasn &apos;t until i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to sum@@ mar@@ ize that for you for a minute .
if you think you &apos;re inside and out and out of them , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t do .
so , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for somebody in this audience here .
we should be able to ro@@ er everything that we want .
thank you very much .
so , fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ s mat@@ ched to everything .
and finally , satur@@ day : a self-@@ , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world a little bit about you , without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me and over and over again , when people came to me this week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conver@@ sa@@ tions .
clearly , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
so , before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to talk about it all again .
because the lesson that i &apos;ve been trying to learn from this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to be emotion@@ ally embar@@ ras@@ sed with this stuff , because the corner is going to give you another crazy , color@@ ful , eng@@ aging of out@@ put that will just wait for me if i &apos;ve got a little bit in the he@@ arts and search and search .
thank you very much about that .
thank you very much .
good after@@ noon , everybody jo@@ ined together .
i &apos;ve got one i want to show you here .
think of this as a bit of a play , as a flying picture .
this is what we call in our laboratory , per@@ cep@@ tual design .
now , let me tell you a little bit about that .
now , if you take this picture -- i mean , i &apos;m an itali@@ an , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y comes up with this image in it@@ al@@ y , but the reason i &apos;m going to show you this is something very interesting in the past couple of decades .
now , some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a , then you took a budget and put it on top of a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now today , you need , if you want to win a race , you actually need something like this here -- something that has la@@ id down the car in real time , and then process it and use it and then use it and then use it and then use things back to that vehicle and change things in real time while information is acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating .
this is what you would call , in engineering teams , a re@@ al-@@ time control system .
and essentially , it &apos;s a system which is made from two parts -- one sen@@ sing part and a real ar@@ end@@ as@@ is .
what &apos;s interesting now is the re@@ al-@@ time control system begin in our lifetime .
our cities have been , in the last few years , with networks and electr@@ on@@ ics and electr@@ on@@ ics .
they become their computers in the free .
and as a computer , they start acting in other ways , they &apos;re percei@@ ved and driven and driven .
when we &apos;re building cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
it &apos;s only by the way that i want to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population there is living there .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- it &apos;s reach@@ ed up to 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
out of the cities , all of that percei@@ ves , pul@@ ls all of that sense and moving into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i for mom@@ a later was organized in the summer during the som@@ ter@@ er .
it &apos;s called &quot; i &apos;m talking to myself . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , begin to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if each at@@ om is out there in both , a sen@@ sor and an es@@ v@@ ist .
and this changes radi@@ cally the interaction that we humans have out there with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o formed the mo@@ ses , does it mean that he took the ham@@ mer and he said , &quot; can you still see a little spot underneath the ham@@ mer -- and actually said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ isi@@ n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you care ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins to answer us for the very first time .
so i &apos;m just going to show you a couple of examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and the idea of power@@ ing it .
so let &apos;s start with that .
so the first project i want to introdu@@ ce to you is actually one of the first our lab@@ s .
it came up in it@@ al@@ y four and a half years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve actually been able to use new kinds of network that &apos;s been applied to the world -- this is a mobile tele@@ phone web -- and anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous information from this network , that are colle@@ cted from the oper@@ ators to understand how the city works .
and the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was a foot@@ ball world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship that won the foot@@ ball world .
some of you will remember , it was playing as it@@ al@@ y for fr@@ ance , and then at the end of the zi@@ dan@@ e , the lea@@ f whi@@ p .
and anyway , it@@ al@@ y won at the end of the end .
now , look at what happened this day , just as the activity of activity that happens in the network .
and here you see the city .
you can see in the middle of the k@@ nee k@@ um , the flu@@ id ti@@ vers .
in the morning , before the game .
you can see the ti@@ mel@@ ine at the top .
it used to be after@@ noon , people here , and there , the phone calls , and moving .
the game starts to start -- sil@@ ence .
fr@@ ance makes an tor . it@@ al@@ y makes a tor .
right now , people are making a short phone call , go to a toi@@ let .
secon@@ dly , second time . end of the normal game .
first incre@@ ren@@ cy , second .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in a moment of lea@@ st@@ ling , cha@@ irs .
it@@ al@@ y w@@ ins . yeah .
now , that night , everybody went to the center to celebra@@ te .
they saw the big magni@@ fi@@ ci@@ pit@@ ation .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the team of san york and the prime minister at the same time .
and then they all went down .
you see the picture of the city mas@@ enz@@ o , where the ro@@ ot@@ al seas@@ on , where people go to celebra@@ te -- to have a big party , and you can see that there &apos;s a big party out there at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
very quickly , another example of sen@@ sation : this isn &apos;t about people , it &apos;s about things that we use and consu@@ me .
now , now we know all about where our things are coming from .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps , where there &apos;s a ma@@ c computer , where they came together .
but we know just a little bit about where things go .
so we actually , in this project , we &apos;ve actually designed some small mark@@ ers to track the g@@ arb@@ age as it comes through the system .
so we started with a bunch of volunte@@ ers who helped us , a little over a year ago , to high@@ light things that they were blo@@ wing away -- different types of things you can see -- things that you would just throw away away .
and then we have the little chi@@ ps , the little br@@ ands , the little br@@ ands , gl@@ ue and start to track it .
so here &apos;s the results that we &apos;ve just got .
it was from se@@ attle ...
and after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of in@@ efficiency in the system .
we can actually make the same things with less energy .
the data had not available before it .
but that &apos;s happening a lot of un@@ prof@@ it@@ er@@ ers and complicated things .
but the other thing that &apos;s happening is that , if you think about that every day that the c@@ up that we throw away doesn &apos;t just disappe@@ ar , they &apos;re still not going to disappe@@ ar anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we &apos;re going to show that to people , then we can move back to change change .
so this is the cause for this project .
so , my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , could give you a lot more about seeing and many other amazing things you can do with you , but i want to talk to you in the second part that we discus@@ sed , and that &apos;s the re@@ co@@ very of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in sing@@ a@@ go@@ za , spa@@ in .
and it started with a question of the citi@@ man survey who came to us and said that spa@@ in and south europe have a beautiful tradition to use water in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you com@@ bine technology , new technology with that ?
and one of the ideas that were being imple@@ mented at mit in a work@@ place , imagine these ro@@ ins and val@@ ves , magne@@ net val@@ ves , val@@ u@@ ps that open and close .
they cause what &apos;s going on like a water cur@@ ren@@ cy with the diagra@@ m of water
so when these pieces fall down , you can write for them , you can show patterns , images , tex@@ ts .
and you can look at him , and it &apos;s going to open up to get you through , as you can see in this picture .
well , we announ@@ ced the ma@@ yo@@ r of bel@@ land .
it really enjo@@ yed him very much .
and we got the mission to design a building in the exp@@ o of the exp@@ o .
we called it the digital water pa@@ xic@@ le@@ on .
the entire building was made out of water .
there are no do@@ ors or windows , but when it &apos;s approach@@ ing it , it &apos;s going to open up and it &apos;s going to let you .
the cei@@ ling was also covered with water too .
and if it &apos;s win@@ dy , if you want to reduce the sy@@ r@@ inge , you can actually leave the roof down .
or you could close the building and become the entire architecture , like in this case , you know , this days , if you dro@@ ve the roof , you get photos of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destro@@ y the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappe@@ aring .
and here &apos;s how the building works .
you can see the person who wonder@@ es what happens in the inside .
and here , when i was trying to see the pro@@ test of the sensor@@ s that opened the water , not to be we@@ t .
now , let me tell you what happened one night when all the sensor@@ s stopped to work .
but in fact , that night , it was an even greater fun .
all the children from sam@@ a@@ go@@ za came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open up to let them go , but a building that still brea@@ ks and holes in the water , you had to jump out without we@@ t .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architec@@ ts , engineers , as designers , we &apos;re always thinking about how people who are using things that we design .
but the reality is completely un@@ predic@@ table .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that will be used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical ima@@ ging of the water , the diagra@@ m of water , and the proje@@ ctions on it .
and this is what made us think about the project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
so , imagine these at@@ tribu@@ tes could actually start flying .
imagine that you could have little heli@@ cop@@ ters that fly through the air , and each of them with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a piece of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
now , here &apos;s the video .
so imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter like the one you saw earlier , which moves with other moves , completely syn@@ chr@@ ony .
you can have these clou@@ ds .
you can have some kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display like this -- a smo@@ oth forma@@ tion in two dimensions .
or inevi@@ t@@ ably , in three dimensions , where what changed is the light , not the position of the ima@@ gery .
they can play with a variety of different ways .
imagine that you could just appear in different parts of the screen or si@@ zes , in different resol@@ ution solutions .
but then it could be only a 3d cloud of ima@@ gery that you can go to and walk through , and look through them that you can look for from lots and lots of direc@@ tions .
what you &apos;re looking at here is a real fl@@ y@@ pool controll@@ er , starting down as before , to form an equ@@ ally vi@@ c table .
and if you turn the light on it , it looks like this , and just as we saw it before .
so , imagine that every single one of people is being controlled .
it may have a single image of a pul@@ se that comes from people , from the mov@@ ements of the people or so .
i want to show you something here to the first place .
we &apos;ve been working with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time in new york and the scale in ma@@ il@@ and -- we &apos;ve taken its mov@@ ements in 3d in the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater to use it as moment@@ um for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
this is where they dance ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
on the left side , you &apos;re going to see the ima@@ gery that occu@@ p@@ y different in@@ spir@@ es .
it &apos;s at the same time a re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan , and a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory of motion .
so that &apos;s what you can feel to your movement .
they can do it all the time .
but then once we have all the ima@@ gery points , you can play with it and play with color movement and manipu@@ late movement .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impul@@ se for fl@@ y@@ fire .
so , i want to show you the lat@@ est project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olymp@@ ics in london .
and it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , think of what we want to engage with people to do something and to change the environment -- almost something that we call the clou@@ ds of clou@@ ds as to move a ic@@ eless , but with a cloud .
so , imagine that everybody can give a little don@@ ation for a picture .
i think that the remarkable part of the last couple of years , the last several decades , is that we &apos;ve wired from a physical world to a digital world .
this has di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed everything , knowledge , and it &apos;s acc@@ essi@@ ble by the internet .
today , we can , for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-@@ organi@@ zing forces of the networks to the physical world .
and this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can take us to take the next challenges -- think about climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we then change the digital world to the physical change .
so the idea is that we actually embra@@ ce the people in which they rel@@ ate to things , colle@@ c@@ tively .
the cloud , again , is made of diagra@@ m of diagra@@ m , just like a cloud is made of particles in the same way .
and those particles are water , while our cloud is out of diagra@@ m of diagra@@ ce .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it &apos;s covered with ima@@ ging points .
and they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom of the most important moments for 20@@ ia and bes@@ i@@ des each other , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something about their vie@@ ws , they can walk , like london d@@ ap@@ s of new mountain sum@@ mit .
you can go in there .
and a kind of digital ill@@ um@@ on in the night -- but as a very important , a new way of a new kind of experience for anyone to go to the top of the top .
why thank you .
as a perfor@@ mer , connection is really important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to pro@@ pose that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a last 10 years ago , where i saw my first pol@@ o h@@ oth .
i &apos;m going to make a@@ we a@@ we .
my heart was cr@@ us@@ hing , and i was embar@@ ras@@ sed while i was trying to gra@@ b what i was standing in front of me .
the ic@@ e@@ b@@ elt around me had only 60 foot out of the water , and i was only ama@@ zed that this was a s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on a different s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , year after year .
ic@@ ic@@ amo@@ gs are born as a cal@@ ise of an gl@@ aci@@ er , or by kno@@ cking out from ice shel@@ ders .
every ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
they interact with their surro@@ und@@ ings in a certain way , and their experiences .
some re@@ f@@ used to go up and sit down until the bit@@ ter end , while others don &apos;t stand out and circle down dra@@ matic passion in any event .
if you look at a ic@@ e@@ berg , you easily think that it &apos;s isol@@ ated , separ@@ ated and alone , just as we often see .
but the truth is far away from that .
as a ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , i &apos;m going to de@@ cre@@ ase his pre@@ temporary atmosphere .
during the ic@@ e@@ berg , it puts cir@@ ral ri@@ p@@ -@@ rich drin@@ king water that kill@@ s a lot of life in life .
i &apos;m going to walk out to my video of this ic@@ e@@ berg as if i make portra@@ its of my ance@@ sts , in the mind that you look at these individual moments of eye , never again .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt it out , it &apos;s not an end , but an ab@@ duc@@ ting of their path around the life cycle .
part of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;ll see is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and a part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
these last images i &apos;d like to show you , i &apos;m showing you a ic@@ e@@ berg that i &apos;ve been proje@@ cted in c@@ ot@@ t@@ su@@ at@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
very r@@ ar@@ ely , you &apos;re actually becoming wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing an ic@@ e-@@ berg e@@ ye@@ th .
so now , here &apos;s what you see .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
and i want you to watch the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it &apos;s at the water line .
you can see here , it starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the guy stands there .
that &apos;s the average size of a green@@ land ic@@ e@@ berg .
it ten@@ ds to be about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you another side of his person@@ ality .
thank you very much .
my life is really quite ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ated to work in some amazing projects .
but with the cool@@ est thing that i &apos;ve ever worked on , it &apos;s about this guy .
his name is a temp@@ t .
it was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artists in the &apos; 8@@ 0s leading .
then one day , he came back from walking back , and he said , &quot; dad , my legs nu@@ m@@ bling . &quot;
and this was the ex@@ teri@@ ation of the sound .
it &apos;s totally paraly@@ zed today .
he can only use his eyes .
and i qu@@ and@@ ed against him .
i have a company that can do design and anima@@ tions , so gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably a complex part of what we ad@@ mi@@ red and pay attention to in the art world .
and so we decided to support tony -- temp@@ t -- and to support his thing .
and i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to be doing with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
and i just want to say to him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , this is not -- i saw ste@@ phen haw@@ king -- can not be communic@@ ated with all the paraly@@ zed people with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about higher corpo@@ rate class and there &apos;s an amazing in@@ sur@@ ance , you can actually do that .
ordinary people aren &apos;t available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how are you communic@@ ating ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &quot; bu@@ tter@@ fly &quot; and &quot; stre@@ eping glo@@ b &quot; ?
this is how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fing@@ ers walk along .
and i was like , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ tic , how could that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to make just a check check , and instead i made a check out , which i did not have the easi@@ est idea of how to introdu@@ ce it to him .
i was commit@@ ted to a place and his father and his father -- and i said , &quot; well , my pro@@ pos@@ al is this : tony &apos;s going to speak , we will get to him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his art@@ work again
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that somebody who &apos;s still wor@@ ing all this can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i spoke for a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys from gras@@ k , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they &apos;ve got a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface and then draw with a las@@ er test that contro@@ ls only the negative surface .
so they &apos;re pul@@ ling around and they create art instal@@ lations like this .
they &apos;re saying that all the things that are going on up there will follow a lifetime cycle .
it starts with the sex sur@@ ve@@ ys , and then the dolph@@ ins come in , the bus@@ s for@@ mu@@ late and the final people , actually , are art .
but there was always a life cycle in their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
and so i went home and ate with my wife and i had dinner with her all the time , and i thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s a las@@ er to control things , we should find a way to ta@@ x a las@@ er , so that it would be a geni@@ us . &quot;
and that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization , and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reach@@ ed a few things .
first of all , we hi@@ red the in@@ sur@@ ance of the do@@ ors , and actually got a device to be able to communicate with this , to communicate -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine .
that was amazing .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to him or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so mis@@ er@@ able , this guy &apos;s incredible . &quot;
plus , we fle@@ w seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally out of all the rest of the world -- home home .
my wife , my children and i are dra@@ wn to the garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy have taken over our house and adop@@ ted our house .
a lot of our friends thought that we were beautiful to do that , and that we would come back and all of the images on the walls would get to the gra@@ ff@@ iti rou@@ ts .
but for over two weeks we had progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the beach page in ven@@ ice , and my children were involved , and my dog and we created it here .
it &apos;s called the e@@ ye@@ no@@ sis , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ ses that we &apos;ve bought on the tag@@ ges of ven@@ ice , a little bit of cop@@ per , and a few things from the corpo@@ rate market and the electr@@ on@@ ics .
we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , they dis@@ fold them , put them on an empty light , and now we have a device that &apos;s fre@@ ely available -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code for free , you can down@@ load the software for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can ev@@ et@@ l .
no hospital , no hospital .
and each paraly@@ zed can actually communicate or draw with your eyes .
why thank you .
thank you so much , that was incredible .
so , at the end of two weeks , we went back to temp@@ ts &apos;s room .
and i love this picture , because this is the room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his bedro@@ om .
now , there &apos;s all this gl@@ um in front of the big un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming , zer@@ o@@ po@@ s and per@@ se@@ cu@@ ted marriage , tony came back after the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it &apos;s refle@@ cted beyond his life support system .
we in@@ ju@@ red his bed so that it can see outside .
we &apos;ve put a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the par@@ king be@@ w before the hospital .
and he was looking for the first time in both his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a sense was on the par@@ king space .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , we had to break up in the par@@ king lot , so we felt ourselves as a part of the pres@@ ence of predic@@ tion .
in the end , he sent us an email following the content : &quot; for the first time , for seven years , i dre@@ w a little bit .
i feel that i was sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed under water , and finally someone ste@@ pped down to the bottom and dra@@ wn my head up so i can brea@@ the . &quot;
isn &apos;t that over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
and this is something like our cam@@ po@@ dge scre@@ am .
that kee@@ ps us in the hol@@ ds and continu@@ es to evol@@ ve .
and we need a lot better to get better about this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but there &apos;s a lot of magic pit@@ ch in the same way .
and somebody who has such an arti@@ stic potential makes so much more .
so we &apos;re thinking about how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
since that time , we &apos;ve ob@@ tain@@ ed all sorts of recogni@@ tion .
we &apos;ve won some a@@ wards .
think about it , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve it .
it &apos;s all out of our own po@@ ckets .
so the pe@@ a@@ ks were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
arm@@ strong twi@@ tter@@ ed about us and then , in dec@@ ember , the ti@@ me@@ -@@ bill was hon@@ or@@ ed to us as one of the 50 best inven@@ tions in 2010 , which was really great .
the cool@@ est thing is -- and that inclu@@ des the entire circle -- that this apri@@ l , in the inner city of los angeles of los angeles , will give you an exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; form of the streets . &quot;
and there will be pretty much the tou@@ gh@@ est repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tion@@ ists of the street arts scene -- bank@@ sy , den@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ ws -- all of these guys will be there .
it &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is kind of sho@@ ot@@ ing .
so basically , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , that &apos;s impossible , then make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ mexico -- everything was going to be there at some point .
just make it happen -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with autis@@ te technology , but i &apos;ve just cap@@ tured something , and surro@@ unded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should all be asking you , which is every single day where you get something that is going to be done , if not now , when not now , when , and if not me , who then
thank you very much .
so , i write for kids , and i probably write america &apos;s worst publi@@ sh@@ er auth@@ or .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come out like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in le@@ ther , but no one has ever vot@@ ed for farmers .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ de@@ p@@ is .
well , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find because you &apos;ve dro@@ pped it somewhere .
you go around the block , and you take it as a re@@ vel@@ ation .
this is a painting of a cir@@ cular cycle .
a friend of mine has made it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ drawing .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;m going to tell you about today .
my circle then started back in the high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the classroom of the classroom .
i was the one who was re@@ tali@@ ed every week in the ma@@ vor@@ ian toi@@ let and was be@@ aten blue until a scho@@ ol@@ room saved my life .
she res@@ cu@@ ed my life by le@@ tting me use the toi@@ let in the text@@ room room .
this was what she was ne@@ ating .
and she did it for three years .
and i needed to get out of the city .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , i had 85 dollars , and it beat me to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i found it a lot of work to do with aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , at the middle of the night , i finally got a call from this teacher , m@@ a po@@ sten , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m as@@ ham@@ ed that we never learned as adults to each other .
can you please get to o@@ hi@@ o , and please come in with the man i know you &apos;ve found in the beginning .
and i should say that i have pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer , and i want you to stick it . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she had to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we took care of them , and we gave them eight years old because it was needed for us to do
it was something that we knew to be .
and just as the woman told me to know as an adult , she turned into a box fully and put it in my hands , and he was
so what had happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation of which i was talking about .
the re@@ vel@@ ation is , death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i res@@ cu@@ ed her own .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that needs the rest of the life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that this has been mentioned here so many times .
it needs equ@@ ally -- it needs , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us a little bit of these things .
thank you very much .
imagine a lot of bl@@ ast as you go up to 1,000 meters .
so , imagine a airplane full of smo@@ ke .
imagine a swi@@ mming plant , the cl@@ oth , cl@@ oth , cl@@ oth , cl@@ oth , cl@@ oth , cl@@ oth , sound power .
it sounds fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
well , i had a unique space that day ; i was sitting at 1@@ d .
i was the only one who could talk to the pas@@ sing office .
and so i looked at them in a second , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already applied the machine , and we didn &apos;t get that far away .
you could see alzheimer &apos;s disease .
for two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
and the pilot set up after the hu@@ d@@ son river .
it &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
it swi@@ ts out the eng@@ ines .
so , imagine a little bit of a sound airplane .
and then he said three words -- the lo@@ van@@ -@@ lo@@ ving words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; look for the c@@ up of the sound . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the colle@@ ges of the boat anymore .
and i was able to see it in their eyes , and there was a sh@@ ine that was going to end .
so , i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i found out that in a moment everything is different .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i was thinking about all the people i wanted a hand and didn &apos;t do , all the f@@ ences i wanted to s@@ wal@@ low , all the experiences i wanted and never made .
while i was thinking about that later , a quote occur@@ red to me , which is , &quot; i collect bad cro@@ ds . &quot;
because if the wine is there , and the person is there , i &apos;ll open him .
i don &apos;t want to be more different in life anymore .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , this goal , my life really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned that day -- and that was when we mis@@ sed the george washington , pretty much for hair -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really re@@ gre@@ t .
i was having a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my fail@@ ures , i de@@ cre@@ ased it to become better in everything that i was pac@@ king on .
but in my humanity , i also gave myself to my e@@ go room .
and i left the time that i wa@@ sted for meaning@@ ful things , te@@ te@@ ors , with people who mean something .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and then , when i was thinking about that , i decided to get negative energy out of my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better than that .
now , i &apos;ve no longer wanted for my wife for two years .
it feels great to be great .
i don &apos;t try to have the right anymore ; i &apos;m going to decide to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- that &apos;s when the inner clock began , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; &quot; to coun@@ table
you can come and see the water .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to cr@@ ush in 20 pieces , as we know from docum@@ ent@@ aries .
as we cut down , i had this feeling , man , to die , is not terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s almost as if we were prepar@@ ing for our lives for all the time .
but it &apos;s been very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sa@@ dness really made , really , in a thought , that i only wish one thing to do .
i just wish i could see my children grow up .
about a month after@@ ward , i vis@@ ited my daughter -- first gra@@ ders , not a lot of arti@@ stic talent .
... yet , not yet .
and i &apos;m foc@@ using , i &apos;m cr@@ ying like a little child .
and in the world , it had all a sense to me .
it was very clear to me at the time by telling the dots that life is a great father about it .
more than anything , anything else is my only purpose in life to be a good father .
i became the mira@@ cle of not dying in this day .
i received another gift , which is to see to the future , to come back and live differently .
my call to anyone who &apos;s flying today is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t talk -- but do you think , and how would you change ?
what would you do that you &apos;re going to do , that you think you &apos;re there forever ?
so how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are you the best parents that you can possibly be ?
why thank you .
so , the idea behind behind the stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to be building the bom@@ b .
the most important po@@ em there for development of nuclear weapons is the ur@@ an-@@ in@@ duced facili@@ ty in men .
the gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ es that you see here , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
now , if we can get to com@@ ment with the systems that control and val@@ ves , then we can actually deal with a lot of problems with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , actually .
these gr@@ ell@@ o@@ x@@ es are not running with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a whole other technology .
but if we can make a effective switch virus at a laptop that is used by a war@@ ber@@ -@@ engineering , to con@@ temp@@ late this gra@@ y box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and that &apos;s behind the war@@ x@@ net planning .
so we start with a wind@@ le@@ p@@ y farmer .
the user data is trans@@ fer@@ red into the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ged the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear energy program , and it turns out to be -- mission imple@@ mented .
it &apos;s a piece of ca@@ ke , isn &apos;t it ?
and i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started our research to stu@@ x@@ gen six months ago , completely un@@ known , which was the meaning and purpose of this form .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the wind por@@ tion , the dr@@ p@@ per@@ o part , it made a lot of r@@ o@@ - da@@ y@@ worth of sh@@ ots .
and there seemed to be something , with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , this re@@ al-@@ time control system .
and this attra@@ cted our attention , and we started a laboratory -- project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ om@@ o@@ w , and we looked at this constru@@ ct .
and then a funny little thing happened .
stu@@ x@@ net was sc@@ ra@@ king like a contra@@ ct that doesn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ p@@ pl@@ ing , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
it didn &apos;t make any sense in my mind .
and after experim@@ enting with different kinds of che@@ ese , i decided that this is a appropriate attack .
totally prepared to occu@@ p@@ y a particular goal
and the dr@@ op@@ er &apos;s active in the gra@@ y box act when there &apos;s a special con@@ figu@@ ration discovered , even if that particular program is discovered , which is what &apos;s happening to infe@@ ction at this point .
and if you don &apos;t , then stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
so , this is really what my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it may , for example , say , a us@@ -@@ american power plant , or it might be an chemical instal@@ lation .
so we should soon figure out what the target is .
so , extra@@ mm@@ ed and de@@ fe@@ ated the attac@@ ks , and found that it &apos;s up in two digital war@@ heads -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were highly profession@@ ally constru@@ cted by people who were obviously available to have all of their sta@@ tions available .
it knew all kinds of str@@ ings and ear@@ tes that they had to stick .
in fact , they probably knew the size of the machine oper@@ ators .
so , they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got the fi@@ pp@@ er of stu@@ x@@ net &apos;s complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , the user data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisti@@ cated than anything that we &apos;ve ever seen before .
here &apos;s an ex@@ cer@@ pt from this attack code .
so , we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines code .
it looks quite like ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned micro@@ hi@@ tu language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be made out of this code .
so what we first looked for was systems -- systems of systems , because we know what these com@@ modi@@ ties were .
and then we looked for ti@@ les and data structures and tried to connect it to the real world -- with potential fear in the physical world .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these tar@@ gets that we could stand or dis@@ agree with .
so in order to do these theor@@ ies , we re@@ mind ourselves that it &apos;s definitely extra@@ ordin@@ arily high s@@ ab@@ amp , it has to act with a high quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because most infe@@ ctions have been repor@@ ted .
now , in this area , there aren &apos;t a lot of thousand goals .
it basically runs out to the bu@@ cket , atom@@ i@@ c power station and the ur@@ gen@@ ic plant in nat@@ ance itself .
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; make me a list of all the experts for cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge and strength from our cli@@ ent stem tr@@ un@@ k . &quot;
and i called them up , and i ta@@ sted her knowledge to compare their exper@@ ti@@ se to compare what we found in the code and in the data .
and this worked very well .
so , we were able to pull out the little digital flow of the road with the road controll@@ er .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part within the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipu@@ late the speed of that ro@@ cket , you actually can be able to cra@@ w@@ l the ro@@ tor , and eventually you can get the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge blo@@ wing out .
and what we &apos;ve discovered is that the goal of the attack actually was to let it happen slowly and inno@@ br@@ antly -- that &apos;s obvious to try to get des@@ pair in the trial , so that they would not be able to get out of it quickly .
the great digital war@@ suit -- we came up with a insi@@ ght by looking at very accu@@ rate data and data structures .
so , for instance , the number 16@@ 4 cra@@ cks very much out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started working through science liter@@ ature , about how these cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges are built in nat@@ ance , and found out that they &apos;re struc@@ tured in so-@@ called k@@ as@@ ca@@ des , and all the k@@ ar has 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
so , that made sense . it was related to each other .
and it got better than that .
this cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge in iran has been divi@@ ded in 15 can@@ ens called the level .
and guess what we found in the ang@@ er@@ er@@ al code ?
it &apos;s an almost iden@@ tical structure .
so , again , that was a really good thing .
and this gave us big confidence for what we were looking at here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it just wasn &apos;t going to work like this .
these results were ac@@ compli@@ shed through several weeks of hard work .
and often , we just ran into a run@@ e@@ day and we had to harv@@ est us .
but anyway , what we found is that both two state heads were actually head@@ ed toward one goal , but made out of different direc@@ tions .
the little jump takes over a cas@@ -@@ ca@@ p , and kno@@ cks out the ro@@ tors and slo@@ cks them , and the big shi@@ el@@ d comes into interaction with six k@@ am@@ ca@@ des in inter@@ actions and manipu@@ lation virtu@@ es .
so , by and large , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we actually have determin@@ ed what the goal is .
it &apos;s nat@@ ance , and it &apos;s just men &apos;s matter .
so we don &apos;t have to worry about the fact that other goals could be run by stu@@ x@@ yp@@ es .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- actually let me ki@@ ck my mind out of the so@@ cks .
down there , there &apos;s the gra@@ y box , and on top of you , you see the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
now , what this thing does is that it cat@@ ches the distribu@@ ting values of sensor@@ s -- like prin@@ ting sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tion sensor@@ s -- and it invol@@ ves giving legi@@ ti@@ mate code that is still attac@@ king , and it &apos;s going to run with fal@@ se in@@ formed data .
and in fact , this fal@@ se con@@ stra@@ in@@ ted data of stu@@ x@@ net has already been recor@@ ded before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where the tracking lim@@ b is being f@@ ed with se@@ ed video recor@@ ds with se@@ ed video recor@@ ding .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
so , clearly , the idea of this is not just , the machine oper@@ ators are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
so , the idea is to over@@ look a digital security system .
we need international security systems where a human machine oper@@ ators can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in an power station , for example , if the great ste@@ am tur@@ bine is going to be too fast , then you have to open it out of a milli@@ seconds in milli@@ seconds .
now , this , of course , can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
so , at this point , we need digital security systems .
and when they &apos;re thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , then really bad things can actually happen .
the power plant can explo@@ de .
and not the machine leaders , or the security system , it will be noticed .
this is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
but it goes even worse .
and what i &apos;m telling you now is very important .
think about it . this attack is gener@@ al .
it has nothing to do with cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , with ur@@ ani@@ um ten@@ sion .
so , for example , he would work for just as well -- in a power factory , or in a car factory .
it &apos;s gener@@ al .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attac@@ ker -- you don &apos;t have to do the pay@@ load of data about a us@@ o of how we saw it at st@@ x@@ net .
you could use ordinary use technology for trans@@ forming technology .
you just have to spread it as far as you can possibly .
and when you do that , you end up getting a cy@@ ber wea@@ pon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we &apos;ve got to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for such attack is not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the dig@@ ri@@ ty of the environments .
we need to put ourselves in the consequences , and we &apos;re getting better to pre@@ p@@ are ourselves .
why thank you .
i &apos;ve got a question .
r@@ al@@ ph , there &apos;s been a lot of repor@@ ts repor@@ ted that people assu@@ me that mo@@ s@@ the@@ tu is the main organization behind it .
is that your opini@@ on as well ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . all right .
and i think that the mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to is involved , but the power of power is not israel .
so , the driving force is the cy@@ c force , super@@ power .
there &apos;s only one thing , and that &apos;s the united states -- happiness , fortunately .
on the other hand , our problem would actually be even bigger .
thank you for le@@ tting us feel a fear of pleasure . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years trying to place myself in situations that are usually very difficult and somehow somehow dangerous .
i went to ja@@ il -- hard .
i &apos;ve been working in a coal min@@ ing station -- dangerous .
i was writing in the war -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with nothing like this -- a couple of fun at the beginning -- a little bit of a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve ex@@ posed most of my career to be ex@@ posed to terrible situations , and all of it just for trying to look at social wi@@ ke@@ -@@ time that they &apos;re comp@@ elling and interesting , and hopefully , in a way , what they do is make a sense of the audience .
so when i knew that i was going to come here to look at the world of brand@@ ing and spon@@ sor@@ ing , i knew i was going to do something a little different .
some of you may have heard that , a few weeks ago , i shu@@ t an ad on e@@ bay a couple of weeks ago .
i sent out some facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter news stories , and i gave people the opportunity to get the control right to my ted@@ talk .
in fact , some happy people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ profit , got the usual opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son had never had a ti@@ tle that has a lot of content , and there was a lot of evidence in terms of what the top@@ ic would actually be .
and so what you &apos;ve got is this : your name is pres@@ ented here , which is , my ted@@ talk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject will be , and all of you will be able to fly the e@@ ars , especially if i give your company to be stupid in the face of your participa@@ tion .
but actually , apart from that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people these ted@@ talks look at these lines ?
a whole bunch of stuff .
that &apos;s just the work@@ force , by the way .
so , despite that war@@ ning , i knew anybody would buy the rights rights .
now , if you asked me this one year ago , i would not have been able to tell you that with a certain@@ ty .
but the new project that i &apos;m working on , my new film , is to study the world of marketing , the adverti@@ sing .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going through some pretty horri@@ ble situations over the years , but nothing was really embar@@ ras@@ sed with me , nothing that would be as difficult to do on anything as difficult and as dangerous as these guys go into a room .
and you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is , i want to take a film around integr@@ ator , marketing and adverti@@ sing , with the whole film is being finan@@ ced by inten@@ se inter@@ ement , marketing and adverti@@ sing .
and the film will be called &quot; the studio ti of ever@@ ti . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the meth@@ tic@@ ar fan &quot; is that everything from above to the end , from the beginning to the end , is completely pic@@ tured with br@@ ands -- from the front spon@@ sor that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x .
now , this brand , the quant@@ um st@@ m sta@@ dium , the sta@@ hil@@ arian center ...
these guys are going to be connected to the movie in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty forever .
and so , the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in ancient level , for all time ?
i am a j@@ und@@ ant person .
that was more to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze .
it was &quot; in e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have brand x as ti@@ tle spon@@ sor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;re going to sell every categ@@ ory out of the movie .
that &apos;s how we sell a sho@@ e , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest sho@@ e you &apos;ve ever used for ...
and the biggest car you &apos;re ever dan@@ cing out of , &quot; the meth@@ ti ever@@ ti &quot; is the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention from &quot; the meth@@ tic@@ ar tan . &quot;
so the idea is , bes@@ i@@ des showing you that mar@@ ks are a part of life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
so the goal of the whole film is transpar@@ ency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of stat@@ es@@ s@@ ar .
so , that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy if you could get ce@@ g to do that .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how de@@ dic@@ ated people are going to be .
do you have an perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use the point of view , because this has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but you know how this &apos;s going to be going ?
how much money is requi@@ red to realize that ?
one , 1.@@ 5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth any need to address some really familiar br@@ ands .
so , who knows when the film comes out , we might see like a hor@@ den can@@ di@@ book .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
and the answer is highly likely &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing to do about the movie or a hard thing to do about me ?
j@@ k : both of them .
so -- meaning , not so optimi@@ stic .
so , my gentle@@ man , can you help me ? do i need help .
well i can help .
al@@ right .
a@@ wes@@ ome .
we need to think about what br@@ ands are .
there is .
when you look at the people who you have to deal with ...
there are a few places that we can rel@@ ate to .
so , imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; meaning that we wanted to do a back@@ ession .
and it turned out that it really meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your movie . &quot;
and just so , all these companies disappe@@ ared , one after the other .
didn &apos;t want to have something to do with the movie .
well , i was ama@@ zed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i &apos;ve been conf@@ used , because i thought the whole concept of adverti@@ sing is to present the product as many people as possible , as many people as possible , as you can see .
in particular , in the world , in this inter@@ section of new and old media and the frag@@ mented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being able to be in this new exciting frame tool that makes the mas@@ ses that make this message .
no , that &apos;s what i was thinking .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a f@@ at@@ al mistake , and that &apos;s what it was like .
actually , no , that was not the mistake at all .
that would not have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but that &apos;s a problem , which is a problem .
you see , when you put transpar@@ ency on google search is this -- this is one of the first images that comes out .
i really like your kind , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now .
that was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free of de@@ ception and tra@@ cks , just dete@@ cting and looking at information , especially in terms of cap@@ ability and access to information , especially what business comm@@ ates on -- the last line is , sur@@ ely , what business argu@@ ments are .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transpar@@ ency right now .
our politicians say , our president says it &apos;s , even our ce@@ o will say it .
but then , when it comes to the fact that it &apos;s supposed to be imple@@ mented , something changes .
but why ? well , transpar@@ ency is sc@@ ary -- like this strange bear , that &apos;s still cr@@ as@@ hing .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this strange land@@ way road .
and it &apos;s very ris@@ ky , too .
what else is even ris@@ ky ?
a whole sh@@ y cool pair of cool stuff .
it &apos;s extremely ris@@ ky .
so when i began to talk to the companies and to tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to talk about a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me at the lie -- and he &apos;s sitting there looking at me and looking at this sight -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three ver@@ sions of each story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version of it . &quot;
so , you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there was only one company , an agen@@ cy ready to help us -- and only because i had to do john bon@@ d and richard k@@ sh@@ en@@ mass for years -- i realized i needed to do it alone , and i had to go right with my team to companies .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , if you start talking about these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is a ful@@ l-@@ per@@ forming problem .
i &apos;ve got friends who make big , giant hollywood movies , and i &apos;ve got friends doing little architec@@ ce movies like i do .
and my friends , who are making big , giant hollywood movies , say that the reason their movies are so successful in the brand part@@ ners that they have .
and then my friends , who make little tele@@ case movies , &quot; well , how are we going to compe@@ te with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the meth@@ tic@@ ar sandwi@@ ch . &quot;
so , how exactly are we going to see the bus in the movie ?
every time i make my way , and whenever i open the medical p@@ lot , you will see a de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
and every time i intervie@@ wed someone , i can say , &quot; are you being we@@ ti@@ ful for this interview ?
are they near ? you look a little bit nervous .
so i want to help you cal@@ m up .
so maybe you should have a little bit of it in front of interview a little bit . &quot;
and then we &apos;ll offer one of these great gri@@ od@@ les .
either &quot; fl@@ ute fusion &quot; or a &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds &quot; -- they &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be com@@ modi@@ fied both for men and women -- soli@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the shor@@ t@@ up .
now , all of you can answer your questions and give you an out@@ come .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so as you &apos;ve spo@@ ken about the smaller movies , we are as a metaphor .
so we don &apos;t have one budget like other br@@ ands .
so these kinds of things -- you know , people are respon@@ ded to skelet@@ es -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
which words would you figure out to be driving ?
finally , there &apos;s a d@@ k .
that &apos;s a great question .
all sorts of technologies .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the br@@ ess .
we &apos;re talking about b@@ old , fresh .
and i think , &quot; fres@@ h@@ ist &quot; is a great word that this categ@@ ory is actually a positive power , unlike &quot; fight smell and mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure . &quot;
it &apos;s fresh for you .
how can we keep them fresh longer -- better fresh , more fres@@ h , three times fres@@ h .
these things have a positive effect of those things .
and this is a milli@@ on-@@ si@@ z@@ is@@ hi@@ ck .
what about me ? what about the prin@@ ting profi@@ le ?
i &apos;ve got to talk to the guy in the street , who are like me , ot@@ to consu@@ l@@ tan@@ ts .
you &apos;re supposed to tell me something about my brand .
so how would you describe your brand ?
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
well i don &apos;t know .
i really like nice clo@@ th@@ es .
ei@@ ght@@ ine : 8@@ 00 re@@ vi@@ val comes out on sk@@ at@@ er@@ et@@ k , except the ben@@ ch day .
all right , what &apos;s the mar@@ ch of ger@@ ry ?
uni@@ br@@ ell@@ ous .
now , i think the gene , the style i &apos;ve got is probably &quot; astro@@ glamour . &quot;
i like lots of bad colors , lots of gra@@ cks and things like that .
but mostly i &apos;ve got an ac@@ id geni@@ us , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and anything like that .
if dan would be a brand , it would probably be a classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ des trip .
man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say , spon@@ ute fly .
woman # 2 : divi@@ l hi@@ pp@@ ie , divi@@ de yo@@ g@@ i , divi@@ de in broo@@ kl@@ y@@ n-@@ n-@@ girls -- i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m the husband . i &apos;m the guy .
i sell breast bil@@ ls across the country , worldwide .
so , i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my small , di@@ stor@@ ted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x , because i was an ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ator .
man five : mar@@ ro@@ wed al@@ co@@ hol addi@@ ct app@@ ber@@ gs .
can you do that ?
an@@ yer : i &apos;m a law@@ yer stam@@ p .
i &apos;m a master .
now , we can &apos;t all be the tom@@ -@@ brand , but i &apos;m often seeing myself in the inter@@ section of radio glamour and lo@@ vely fly .
and what &apos;s noticed is that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could be in my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call &quot; brand@@ ed person@@ ality . &quot;
and so , i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ ani@@ man in pit@@ ts@@ burgh .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ st@@ ling , fe@@ at , w@@ am , to discover this brand person@@ ality .
if they were able to do it for those , they could also help me .
they brought out their images , yes ?
this is what i did . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just talk to me a little bit about how it rel@@ ates to your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people who form my world@@ view .
talk to me from this world .
m@@ d : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live , the friends , the family , the family , the family , the way you live your life , your work and so on .
these things come and start from a place , and for me and i start , they start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about .
the next . this was the ni@@ st-@@ ni@@ gh@@ test day of my life .
in what context does it mean to the thought and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s as though i &apos;d like to be .
i do like things that are different .
i like things that are od@@ d . i like kind of od@@ d things .
talk to me about the &quot; why &quot; stage -- what does it get us ?
what &apos;s the ma@@ inten@@ ene ? what &apos;s pu@@ p@@ pe@@ al ?
why is it important to start inno@@ v@@ ating ? what does the red represents ?
talk to me a little bit about that one .
a little bit more about you , that &apos;s not you .
which one of these me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ ms have you run through ?
... that &apos;s not going to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . what kind of roll@@ er@@ ware do you have ?
ee@@ ee@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you very much .
thank you very much for your pati@@ ence .
yeah . okay . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to get out of this .
there &apos;s a lot of ko@@ o@@ dy things going on there .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their brand person@@ nel had two separ@@ ated , but moving pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ nu@@ lo@@ ck orche@@ bles is an ei@@ ght-@@ fashi@@ oned brand of brand .
they &apos;re extremely en@@ sur@@ ding very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost one con@@ tradi@@ ction about it .
and i think some companies will only focus on a streng@@ st@@ ly , rather than on both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to be afraid , these elements , and they actually turn these wel@@ come into something positive , and that &apos;s a story of ch@@ ari@@ ck@@ ment .
what other br@@ ands are doing ?
the first one is a classi@@ c , apple .
and you can see it here , this is a photo , wi@@ i , min@@ i of min@@ i co@@ op@@ ers and je@@ t@@ blue .
well , there are br@@ ands and eight br@@ ands , these things that come and go , but one shot , an ei@@ gh@@ th brand is a pretty strong thing .
an eight , sc@@ ra@@ ke brand . how &apos;s your brand ?
if people would ask you to describe their brand identity , their brand@@ ed person@@ ality , what would it be like ?
you have a up@@ -@@ at@@ ta@@ on ? are you something that comes blood in the wo@@ und@@ ings ?
or are they more likely a down@@ -@@ down at@@ tri@@ c ?
are you something that is a little fre@@ ak , a little more quie@@ t , more conser@@ va@@ tive ?
up@@ -@@ at@@ t@@ ler are things that are contra@@ cted , fresh like the web prin@@ ce , ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous , wo@@ un@@ dly , ma@@ x@@ im@@ ous , ma@@ gi@@ cally , ma@@ gical , ma@@ gical , ma@@ gical , ma@@ gical , my@@ sti@@ cal like pen@@ al@@ am .
or are they more like a down@@ -@@ up at@@ be ?
are you sing@@ ing and mon@@ e@@ ve like 1@@ 7 ?
are they establi@@ shed , tradition@@ ally , nur@@ sing , com@@ pos@@ ing , com@@ passionate , like op@@ ra@@ h ?
are they reli@@ able , stable , par@@ ent@@ a@@ tic , safe , birth , sac@@ red , he@@ ar@@ ty and fashion like the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
in the course of the film we had more than 500 companies , the up and down companies , and the &quot; no &quot; they said &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this movie because they didn &apos;t have any control , they don &apos;t have any control over the finished product .
but it turns out that 17 mar@@ ken@@ ers were ready to del@@ ist on that control that was doing so brilli@@ ant and contra@@ ct like me , and that eventually en@@ ab@@ led us to tell stories that we didn &apos;t have to tell -- stories that would normally never be suppor@@ ted for a plasti@@ c@@ ist .
they en@@ able us to tell the story of the neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you now use mr@@ i to pu@@ p the pleasure centers of the brain , both to make adverti@@ sing and also the movies .
we dro@@ ve to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where there was pro@@ hi@@ b@@ ited pro@@ fan@@ ity .
now in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no room af@@ yl@@ um , no po@@ cket , no fl@@ yer , nothing .
and we dro@@ ve in school distri@@ cts , where businesses are going to train their way in de@@ br@@ is schools , all across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most feedback , or where i had the biggest success , are the ones where i inter@@ ac@@ ted with things directly .
and this is what these br@@ ands have done .
because they surro@@ w the middle man , and they went around the agen@@ cies , and they said that the agen@@ cies might not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate with the perfor@@ mer directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people will think of as challen@@ ging our world &apos;s ima@@ ging .
and how was that for you ? what succe@@ e@@ ds succe@@ e@@ ded like
now , given the film at s@@ und@@ ance film festi@@ val , we can look at this .
even as bur@@ r@@ eller was the pre@@ mi@@ ere in janu@@ ary , and since that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million calls from this film .
it &apos;s actually only one time of two one-@@ two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been issu@@ ed yet .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not a con@@ ception .
it hasn &apos;t come out of other countries yet .
now , the film , the film , is a very big one .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project , where almost any adverti@@ sing agen@@ cy that we talked about , has re@@ com@@ men@@ ded their custom@@ ers to let the fing@@ ers pass .
one thing that i think i believe about is that when you get your chance , you make risks that you are in these risks .
and i think , when you keep people from that , then you get them closer to failure .
i think that when you train your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;ve prepared the whole company to come up with an profit .
and i feel that we need to encoura@@ ge people to go to risks .
we need to encoura@@ ge people to have no fear of possibilities that they might be produ@@ c@@ table .
finally , in foc@@ using forward , we should be wel@@ come to fear .
we should put the bear inside the c@@ age .
feel wel@@ come to fear . wel@@ come your risk of the risk
there &apos;s a big ri@@ ff@@ el full of a ri@@ ff@@ el so we can wel@@ come the risk .
and finally , we ought to be wel@@ come to transpar@@ ency .
now , more than ever before , a little bit of a hon@@ est@@ y will get us a little bit .
and that was , using hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my whole talk , &quot; is to wel@@ come you to wel@@ come transpar@@ ency from my good friends of em@@ cs who paid $ 7@@ 100 for the name of e@@ bay for e@@ bay .
big data will be trans@@ formed for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
em@@ c pres@@ ents , &quot; would you wel@@ come transpar@@ ency . &quot;
thank you very much .
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency , is this : what &apos;s the equivalent of the $ 7@@ 100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check check a check on the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ ing foundation -- a check at $ 7@@ 100 -- a check at $ 7@@ 100 to fund my ted arri@@ val in the next year .
so my name is am@@ it .
so 18 months ago , i was doing something else about google , and i re@@ ac@@ ted to do something with muse@@ ums and art , and my che@@ f@@ in , which is now , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months to do .
a lot of fun negoti@@ ations and stories , and i can tell you that with 17 very interesting muse@@ ums of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
and i think my personal perspective is very easy to play with this slide and your contribu@@ tion to your contribu@@ tion
i was growing up in india .
i became a great education program -- i didn &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in me -- but i had no way to have a lot of muse@@ ums and all that art@@ work .
and when i was travel@@ ing , and i went to visit these muse@@ ums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to make these as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions -- art acc@@ essi@@ ble -- to bring technology together to bring together .
we then came up with a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i think i &apos;m going to start with the demon@@ stration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the laun@@ ch .
so you just go to google proje@@ c@@ tat@@ .com .
you can see it around all these muse@@ ums in all of these muse@@ ums .
there &apos;s the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , mom@@ a , who &apos;s her@@ mit@@ age , the ri@@ j@@ ks , van go@@ gh .
in fact , i come to the one of my favor@@ ites , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
so , security , and w@@ her@@ m , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re walking around and you &apos;re mi@@ mi@@ cking .
you want to ori@@ ent yourself in the museum ?
open up the map , and jum@@ ping it with a click of it .
they are they , they want to be ti@@ ll they &apos;re at the end of the book .
except . a lot of fun .
h@@ arb@@ or them .
thank you , but the best one is there .
so i &apos;m now in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , ch@@ ie@@ f wor@@ ker of a dou@@ ble@@ -@@ board .
i see this pl@@ us@@ na@@ ce .
if the museum gives us the image , cli@@ ck on it .
so , this is one of the images .
so here &apos;s all the meta@@ data .
those of you who are really interested in art can cli@@ ff@@ ate here -- but i click this way now .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve been de@@ tain@@ ed with with what we call gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
so this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think , points .
and a lot of people are asking me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
and here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can just zo@@ om in and swim out .
you see a little bit of fun here .
i love that guy ; it &apos;s un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able that expression is un@@
but then they really want to go deep into it .
and so , i began to play around , and i realized that something was going on there .
and then i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
and i went close , and i slowly noticed that these kids were actually getting a little bit .
i was resear@@ ching a little bit earlier with a gentle@@ cy of met , and actually found out that it was about a game called zo@@ a@@ il , where a jo@@ int was be@@ aten at the da@@ in@@ tu@@ an court with a stick .
it seems that it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did , but i learned a little bit about it .
to make really close , you can go down to the char@@ ni@@ ge .
just to give you a view , i zo@@ om out so you can see what you &apos;re getting .
and here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one is still coming -- in a second .
so let &apos;s quickly jump to mom@@ a , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star@@ t-@@ night .
the previous example of it was to find some detail .
but what if you want to see the br@@ ush stri@@ kes ?
and what if you want to see like van go@@ gh created this ma@@ ster@@ piece for creating the ma@@
you zo@@ om@@ ed in . you can actually go in the middle .
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om in to one of my favorite illu@@ ch@@ ars , until i &apos;m really in the ris@@ ts .
this is star@@ t-@@ night , probably seen this way before .
now , i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot of them , but i don &apos;t have time .
and that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ ctions .
any of you , everybody -- stone , or poor , if you &apos;ve got a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
they can go in and create their own museum online -- from all these pictures , they can put themselves in their own colle@@ ction .
just simple , you go in -- and i created this , called the power of zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om in .
this is the educ@@ ated , and it &apos;s in the national sci@@ ences .
you can see all of the comm@@ ands , send your friends , and you start having a conversation about what you feel when you look at these ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
and i think , finally , to me , the main thing is that all the amazing things here don &apos;t come from google .
it &apos;s not even out of the muse@@ ums , i think , from the muse@@ ums .
i may not be able to say that .
they come from the arti@@ ties .
and that was a kind of a hum@@ bling experience for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be concerned with this digital medium of art and represent them in general online .
and the main question i &apos;ve been asked recently is , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum of museum ? &quot;
and the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s meant to en@@ h@@ ance the experience .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re about about . thank you .
why thank you .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . your brain can be sub@@ divi@@ ded in two hal@@ ves .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the lo@@ gic side , and then the right half that &apos;s the intui@@ tive side .
if we were to have a scale to measure the ap@@ ti@@ teri@@ al every he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , we could be able to represent their brain .
for instance , this is somebody who is completely logi@@ cal .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intui@@ tive .
now , where would you position your brain on that scale ?
some of us may have sel@@ ec@@ ted for one of those extreme , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ den@@ le that &apos;s at the same time in two he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es .
it &apos;s not as though they &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ sive or so .
and they can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
and so , as one of the people , i reg@@ ard myself , with most of the experiment@@ al qu@@ um physi@@ ci@@ sts , who need a good compon@@ ent lo@@ gic to bring together the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good part of intuition to actually ex@@ ec@@ ute the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play it with things .
so we go out and we go out and look at it and see how it &apos;s respon@@ ding , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intui@@ tions that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing at the same time can only be in place at the same time .
i mean , it may be strange to think that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they didn &apos;t have to be born with this idea , they developed it .
so , i remember watching a child sitting on top of a sea spi@@ ke .
he was still a small child , and he didn &apos;t get very good at it , and he sta@@ ys all the way down .
but i &apos;ll bet it &apos;s a very valuable lesson to play with the water door of water , which is , you know , the big things that don &apos;t just let you pass , and that you stay at a location .
and this is a great concep@@ tual model on the planet , so long they don &apos;t have any partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
it would be a terrible model for a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist , because they don &apos;t play with the soil of the soil , but with these little od@@ d particles .
and when they play with their particles , they give all kinds of weird things -- how they fly directly through walls , or at the same time , they can be two different places .
and so they wrote all of these obser@@ va@@ tions , and they called the quant@@ um theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed to describe quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but they didn &apos;t always have to describe them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
this hasn &apos;t taken my intuition , and it &apos;s just because i don &apos;t have to play with particles so often .
well , i &apos;m going to play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen it before .
i mean , no one has ever seen a partic@@ le .
but my logi@@ cal side wasn &apos;t really like that either .
because when all the things are made of particles and all these particles of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , shouldn &apos;t it just mean everything the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics mean ?
i don &apos;t see a reason why that &apos;s not supposed to be that way
so i &apos;m going to feel more clo@@ sely with all this thing , if we somehow show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so , a few years ago , i set out to do that just a few years ago .
so i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a little bit of computer chip .
and you can see that green do@@ t there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m going to put it a little bit . we &apos;re looking at it right here .
and here &apos;s a really large clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , it &apos;s like a jum@@ p@@ board sha@@ ped , and it stands across the edge .
so i did this thing in a similar way , in a similar way to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new si@@ li@@ lic sli@@ ces , and i re@@ fin@@ ed for 100 hours on all the big devices .
so for the last last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this as a swi@@ mming pool of the assem@@ ble pool and to get this thing .
now , this thing has the capacity to be in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
so look , let me give you an analog@@ y .
you know , how un@@ conven@@ i@@ ent it is to be in a strong el@@ ev@@ ator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m on the el@@ ev@@ ator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i &apos;m going to go up to other people , and i &apos;m listening to all these things because i don &apos;t want to leave you with it , or , frank@@ ly , you &apos;re missing .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that un@@ emotional objects feel as much as they can .
the pe@@ ers of un@@ mov@@ able objects are not just people , but also the light that seems to be on them and the wind that is han@@ ging upon them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that when we wanted to see that this piece of metal is quant@@ um mechan@@ ically , we had to get rid of all of our jour@@ ne@@ ys out .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
we swi@@ t@@ ched the light off , put it into a vac@@ u@@ um and su@@ cked up all the air and re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ated it until almost to now , turning down to all the way in the loo@@ p , to be@@ have with behavior like it wanted to be .
and so we measu@@ red his movement .
and we found that it was really strange to move .
rather than that , it &apos;s just standing there , vi@@ br@@ ated it , the way it was vi@@ br@@ ating was kind of like this -- like an exp@@ and@@ ing and collap@@ sing of cy@@ ll@@ ass .
in which we gave him a small sho@@ wer , we could then cause it to vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time , and not too vi@@ br@@ ating -- something that allowed us to just be in quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so , what i &apos;m just going to tell you about is what &apos;s going to be fantastic .
what does it mean to vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time , and not too vi@@ bri@@ ous ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the tri@@ ps of atoms from which the piece of metal is sil@@ ent , and at the same time , they &apos;re moving up and down at the same time , and they &apos;re moving up and down .
it &apos;s just at pre@@ cise points of time , it &apos;s over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming
the rest of the time , they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ ated .
that means that each at@@ om is at the same time in two different places , which is what it means in the same time that the whole piece of metal is two different lo@@ cations .
and i think that &apos;s really cool .
it &apos;s true .
that was worth th@@ ating all this year in the clean space , because , you check that , the scale of scale between a single at@@ om and this piece of metal is just about the difference between metal metal and you .
so if a single at@@ om can be at two different places at the same time , can be this piece of metal in two different places , why isn &apos;t they ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logi@@ cal side says .
so , do you think you &apos;re in a couple of places at the same time , how would that feel ?
how would your mind rel@@ ate to that your body is del@@ oc@@ ated in the room ?
there &apos;s one other aspe@@ ct of the story .
when we war@@ med the lights , we looked at the lights and we looked inside the box , we saw that the piece of metal was there in a piece of time .
and so , i had to develop this new intuition that it looks as though all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are actually just ran@@ t@@ led objects that are put together in a small space .
you hear a lot of talk about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics say that everything is connected to everything .
now , that &apos;s not exactly right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s much lower than that .
it turns out that these connections , their links with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and the aw@@ k@@ ward of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
thank you very much .
in 2007 , i decided that we should re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that , when families think about where they live and work , they &apos;ve given them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities , all of which are in competition to be new resi@@ dents .
at the moment , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t even have a single city available for them to wel@@ come .
but the amazing thing about the city is that they are so much more wor@@ thy than building it .
so we could do the world very easy with sho@@ at , possibly even hundreds of new to@@ w@@ ns .
now this may sound ab@@ sur@@ d for you unless you &apos;ve never been thinking about new cities .
let &apos;s just swa@@ p in to the emergen@@ ce of homes against cities .
imagine trying to live half of the people working in hous@@ ing , doing this , but not yet the other half of them yet .
you could try to bro@@ aden the capacity that exi@@ sted for exi@@ sting a@@ partment .
but you know what they &apos;re going to do in these a@@ part@@ ments and their surro@@ und@@ ings of their surro@@ und@@ ings to avoid the laws of de@@ dic@@ ating and de@@ dic@@ ated from ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ on .
so , it turns out it &apos;s extremely hard to get out of all these di@@ visi@@ ons .
but you could go to a completely new place , create a whole new a@@ partment block , com@@ mis@@ sive the laws there would be suppor@@ ting you and not de@@ dic@@ ated to it .
so i &apos;ve pro@@ posed that governments create new sur@@ faces that give enough place to a city , and they give them a name : char@@ ter game .
i later discovered that , for example , around the same time , ja@@ 4 and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o had been thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans left their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people stay in their own place , and they can do exactly the same thing in hon@@ dur@@ as .
and at this point , ja@@ 4 was saying to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o , &quot; what happens when we get to an im@@ migr@@ ant area of our country -- a part of the can@@ adi@@ an rules , part of the can@@ adi@@ an rule -- and if people would go and work on the top of the can@@ adi@@ an rules , you can work there , and can be able to do everything that normally they should go to canada or american ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suff@@ ered under a pro@@ per com@@ po@@ und crisis .
in the next plan@@ ch elec@@ tions , pe@@ ise lo@@ bo , in a hu@@ b@@ to@@ zing , whose program would promis@@ ed both new sc@@ or@@ es , and also .
he dem@@ and@@ ed oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his festi@@ ch@@ et@@ f .
in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing for a talk to ted@@ global .
tried by impro@@ vement , reading and investi@@ g@@ ating consum@@ ers , i tried to re@@ cover this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the key elements .
the first point , the importance of laws , the laws that deter@@ mine you can &apos;t dist@@ ur@@ b your hab@@ it hab@@ its .
we give new technologies to great attention , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually for the laws that go back to us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the ted@@ talk .
this one , again , showed him ja@@ 4 .
these were the refer@@ ch@@ es that i call .
and he said , &quot; let &apos;s tell this to the rest of our country ! &quot;
so we met in dec@@ ember in a hotel house in dec@@ ember of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
i &apos;ve tried to make a sense of how valuable cities are , how much more valuable you are than what you &apos;re going to do .
and i &apos;ve been using this graph to illu@@ strate how value and ro@@ tat@@ ing is in a place like new york . consider that a surface of a square is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a fairly abstra@@ ct event , at a place when there was a gift , oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the ted@@ talk . &quot;
so the ted@@ talk put in very simple form that a char@@ ter city is a place where un@@ adul@@ ter@@ ated land is a place that determin@@ es the laws that gover@@ ns there and the opportunity to decide , either to live under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as who said we &apos;ve got to resol@@ ve this project , that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way our country is going to get forward .
i was asked to get to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ cr@@ pa and to give a talk to the fourth and fif@@ th janu@@ ary .
so i &apos;ve given one of the facts that i &apos;ve had , which has a graphi@@ cs like this , to try to illu@@ strate that , if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it &apos;s got to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city of den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch represents the new air@@ port that was built in den@@ ver .
even this air@@ port , there &apos;s a hundred square kilometers of the air@@ port .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince hon@@ is@@ ans if you want to build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with at least 1,000 miles of a mile .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand &#91; &#93; &#93; &#93;
poli@@ dly all has sig@@ ned .
the audi@@ ties of the audience were very serious and care@@ ful .
the head of con@@ gress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much for your lec@@ ture , but maybe we could look at ted@@ talk .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop here . &quot;
so , i set down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
and i &apos;ve come to the point that a new city off@@ ers new opportunities to people .
there would be the possibility of living in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city inclu@@ des new ways for leaders to be leaders .
the government leaders in hon@@ dur@@ as would be given to the help of shared countries , they could benefit from their men@@ ters that they would be able to trust the law for this char@@ ter , and to support that everybody could actually trust that char@@ ta is actually missing .
and the insi@@ ght of president lo@@ bo was that the understanding of which i was thinking of as a way to get the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to be able to get the foreign inv@@ e@@ stors in hon@@ dur@@ as that has been suffering for many years in hon@@ dur@@ as that has been suffering for many years .
we took up to a do@@ main .
this picture is taken from this place .
it invol@@ ves 100 and a half thousand miles .
and shor@@ tly after@@ wards , on janu@@ ary 19@@ th , they have vot@@ ed with con@@ gress to change the const@@ it@@ u@@ tional level that &apos;s reli@@ able for speci@@ al destruction that &apos;s reli@@ able for speci@@ al growth areas .
in a country that has just cros@@ sed a bro@@ ad crisis , in the con@@ gress , in the con@@ gress , for this const@@ it@@ u@@ tional change , it was ele@@ cted with a voice .
all par@@ ties , all the den@@ tions of the society , suppor@@ ted this .
but to become part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it has to be appro@@ ved twice by con@@ gress .
on febru@@ ary the 17@@ th of febru@@ ary , it was appro@@ ved for the second time at 1@@ 14 .
immedi@@ ate , after this ele@@ ction , between the 21@@ th and the 24@@ th of febru@@ ary , a d@@ ele@@ gation from about 30 ce@@ ani@@ ans to the two places around the world , most of which were interested in the store of the city .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large new urban urban rus@@ h , which built big in south korea -- big than the urban rus@@ h of ice .
everything that you can see in this picture has been built within four years after four years old took per@@ mis@@ sions to get .
the other place that was very interested in the heart of the city is sing@@ apo@@ re .
there &apos;s been two cities built in china already , and the third one is in prepar@@ ation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about this , it &apos;s the where we are today .
they already have a building compon@@ ent , and they &apos;re already looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a law that &apos;s going to be allowed to participa@@ te in part , and it &apos;s going to be working on an ex@@ ternal legal system .
a country already has off@@ ered off@@ ers to provide his su@@ pre@@ me court , as court for the const@@ it@@ u@@ tional appe@@ al of the de@@ dic@@ ated pa@@ tho@@ s@@ able system .
there &apos;s also a lot of interest and a city designer of the city .
and then they actually bring fund@@ ing with it .
one thing you already know , as you already know , there &apos;s a lot of r@@ ar@@ ers .
there are many businesses that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people who as@@ sign that they want to live perman@@ ently in another place .
a million people went every year every year and migr@@ ant la@@ tin america to the united states .
many of them are fa@@ thers who are forced to let their families go back , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to ear@@ n enough money to make their food and clo@@ thing .
sa@@ dly , sometimes , there are children who are trying to find their parents back that they , in some cases , have no longer seen before for a decade .
so what is it about an idea to think about building a whole new city in hon@@ ela as a whole new city ?
or even the du@@ z@@ zens of these cities , or spread hundreds of all around the world ?
so what &apos;s the idea of being able to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition to be new resi@@ dents ?
so this is an idea worth spre@@ ading to you .
now , my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as have asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions you make at a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you &apos;re going to meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a survey with over 2,000 american people recently , and the average number of decisions that makes a typical american in a single day is 70 .
also , recently , a study with ce@@ os , which she was watching for a week to see the ce@@ o .
and these scientists simply docum@@ ented the different top@@ ics that these ce@@ o occu@@ r , and how much time they spent making decisions that rel@@ ate to the top@@ ics .
and what they found is that an average ce@@ o is working on 13@@ 9 tas@@ ks in the week .
each of these top@@ ics , of course , were from lots and lots of smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were hit in between nine minutes or less .
it &apos;s only for about 12 percent of your decisions that you would need an hour or more of your time .
so think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes of categ@@ ori@@ ties across the one in the middle of the hour ?
how good do you think , are you putting the decisions out of it ?
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest decisi@@ on-@@ making problems in our modern time , the decisi@@ on-@@ making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you a few questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , please , because i &apos;m blind , just your hand will burn if you want to burn some cal@@ ories .
on the other hand , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so , are you willing to hear anything about the decision of over@@ la@@ sting problem ?
thank you very much .
when i gradu@@ ated from stanford university , i went to this very , very ex@@ clu@@ sive res@@ on@@ ant , at least in the back , he was really ex@@ clu@@ sive .
it was a store that was called dra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure frame of pleasure .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and v@@ unt and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ it and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually dro@@ pped high water water .
i loved to go to that business , but at the time , i was wondering , well , how come you never buy anything ?
this is the o@@ live oil .
they had over 75 different types of o@@ live o@@ live oil , including those who came in bo@@ xes , who came from 3,000 years old o@@ vi@@ al trees .
so one day , i decided to go to the crimin@@ al hall one day , and i asked the head , &quot; is this model that you really offer people all this possibilities ? &quot;
and he poin@@ ted to the proje@@ ctions of tou@@ ri@@ sts , who came every day , and they normally had their c@@ ameras in it .
so we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ mel@@ ade for our experiment .
here &apos;s their mar@@ ching ch@@ art .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of new mar@@ mel@@ ade .
we &apos;ve put a little in@@ co@@ as@@ i@@ ence on the ent@@ r@@ ance of the store .
we &apos;ve put six different ta@@ stes out there or 24 different ta@@ stes of mar@@ mel@@ ade , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would i have more people to stand for and try mar@@ ning mar@@ gu@@ i ?
it &apos;s more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent , as if it were six , about 40 percent .
and after@@ wards , we looked at what language was more likely to buy a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now we looked at the rever@@ se effect .
and the people who fall in love when they were 24 , only three percent of them buy a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
of the people who fall in love when they were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mar@@ mel@@ ade .
now , if they calcul@@ ated , people would buy six times more likely to buy a glass mar@@ mel@@ ade , where they had six choices as if they had 24 to date .
now , to decide no glass mar@@ mel@@ ade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our ta@@ st@@ ens -- but it turns out that the decisi@@ on-@@ source problem is also affec@@ ting us in very con@@ sequence decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide even when it comes to our own best interests .
so for the day , financial saving is saving .
so now i &apos;m going to describe you a study that i was going to do with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , in re@@ ference cam@@ en@@ ic@@ a , we@@ i ju@@ ang , where we were trying to make decisions for almost a million americans from about 6@@ 50 genom@@ es in the entire united states , at least in the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of f@@ on@@ ces that were able to have a reti@@ re@@ ment service plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , the prob@@ ability of the prob@@ ability of being saved for tomorrow more tomorrow .
and what we found is that , in fact , there was a context .
so in these series , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 com@@ pounds that people have had anything between two to 5@@ 9 different kinds of man@@ zations .
and what we found was that the more f@@ on@@ ds were off@@ ered that , indeed , the participa@@ tion rate was lower .
now , if you look at the extre@@ mes , the plans that sig@@ ns two f@@ on@@ ds have had a spli@@ t as@@ sign@@ ment in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want to .
in these places , there are nearly 60 fund repor@@ ts , ad@@ ver@@ te@@ ence of about the six@@ th percent .
now it turns out that even when you close close to each other , when there are more op@@ tions to choice , then there &apos;s negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participa@@ te , rather to the fact that the more possibilities they were giving on , the more that they would choose to choose them and to choose them .
the more possibilities they were available to them , the more they put their whole money into p@@ ure market con@@ tex@@ ts .
none of these extreme decisions will be part of the decisions that people would com@@ pla@@ in about when their future financial well-@@ being is important .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three fundamental negative consequences that will provide the supply of more and more choices .
they push up the decision -- push them down , even if it comes to their own pre@@ perfe@@ tion .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial and more bad medical decisions .
they choose more like things that make them less satis@@ fied , even if they make obje@@ ctive better things .
and the main reason about this is that we might enjoy ourselves to look at these huge shel@@ ves full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mu@@ star@@ d , sel@@ ase and mar@@ g , but we can &apos;t be able to move those patterns and exten@@ sions , and then you can actually choose something out of the fantastic offer .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve done in a variety of different research places -- that they can just apply to their business .
first , lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ al .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that it &apos;s less .
people are always wor@@ rying when i say , &quot; de@@ ar . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they lose out of res@@ cu@@ e .
but the truth is , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to bor@@ row , and get rid of the un@@ important creative possibilities , well , there will be the cost of sal@@ es , it &apos;s going to be the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an impro@@ vement of decisi@@ on-@@ making perception .
as pro@@ s@@ thetic and gam@@ able , the various heads and gam@@ ing of chemicals re@@ turned to 15 to 15 , they experienced a sp@@ ine in cars by a 10 percent sp@@ an .
when the golden c@@ at produ@@ c@@ tion@@ ist was going to be able to sell her 10 at the worst test of c@@ at , they experienced that they went to 8@@ 7 percent -- a result of both , the rise of sal@@ es and the redu@@ ction of the cost of the cost
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ cr@@ on today , you know , will give you 4@@ 5,000 products .
this is a typical wal@@ m@@ art today that gives you 100,000 products today .
but the fourth largest super@@ market , which is no@@ where today &apos;s largest super@@ market in the world , and they &apos;re just giving them 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in do@@ sen .
now in the world of sav@@ ings , i think one of the best examples that came to the market was about how best the choice of choice was , something that david la@@ chol@@ son has made was very strong , it &apos;s a program that is being off@@ ered at harvard .
so every single harvard associated now takes auto@@ matically to a lifetime of life .
and those who really want to make choice are off@@ ered 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more f@@ on@@ ds .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to get rid of it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employe@@ e question is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t with@@ stand them , their cli@@ ents can &apos;t interact with it either . &quot;
now , before we started this day after@@ noon , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
and g@@ ary said that he would be ready to see all the people in this audience an all@@ -@@ time ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence to offer the most beautiful way of the world .
here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
and i would like to read to you these guys .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read and ask for you , if you &apos;re ready to cla@@ p for you if you &apos;re ready to be called g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
okay . everyone who &apos;s willing to adop@@ t g@@ ary &apos;s offer .
so is that all ?
all right , so let me show you a little bit more about that .
you knew , it was a trick on it , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for that trip .
i think maybe i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that they looked at obje@@ ctive when they first had more information than the second time , but i would make it a lot of time to make it real for the second time that they re@@ com@@ men@@ d it
because the pain@@ t@@ ings can feel it for their reali@@ ties .
which brings me to second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of decisi@@ on-@@ making over@@ all , it &apos;s the con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between opportunities to understand what the consequences are associated with with the individual possibilities and the consequences that have to be used to be vi@@ vid and con@@ cre@@ te
why do people give about 15 to 30 percent more than they use a map card or a credit card than they use in bar@@ ro@@ ots ?
because it &apos;s not really successful to make it real .
and it turns out , when you make it con@@ cre@@ te , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you can get people to save more .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i &apos;ve done with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o &apos;s art@@ ter@@ o , we &apos;ve done a study with people at mit -- and these people were all in a gather@@ ing in which they sig@@ ned their participa@@ tion for their reti@@ re@@ ment gui@@ dance .
and in the course of this gather@@ ing , we &apos;ve just had these conver@@ sa@@ tions as b@@ ad@@ ly as it used to be , we &apos;ve ad@@ ded a little bit of a small amount of
but the small thing that we &apos;ve ad@@ ded is that we &apos;ve asked people to simply think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they &apos;re going to save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a sp@@ an of participa@@ tion by 20 percent , and there was an increase in the number of people who were willing to save or grow at four percent of the time that they were willing to pay for the sav@@ ings accoun@@ ts .
third , the third issues : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
we can deal with more categ@@ ories than we do more choice than with more choice .
so for instance , here &apos;s a study we &apos;ve done in a magazine shop .
it turns out it &apos;s in the thro@@ wing of super@@ markets up and down in the nor@@ the@@ ast of super@@ markets , the number between 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of maga@@ maga@@ zin@@ es to the top 6@@ 6@@ 4 maga@@ zin@@ es .
well , you know what ?
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and put them in 10 categ@@ ories , or i &apos;ll give you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es , you think that i &apos;ve given you more choice and better choice than i would have given you the 400 to what if i &apos;ve given you the 400 .
because the categ@@ ories tell me how to rel@@ ate to them .
here are two different j@@ lu@@ g@@ ri@@ tic dri@@ vers .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz , &quot; and the other one is called s@@ wing .
if you think that the left announ@@ ke is s@@ wing , and the ad on the right is ja@@ zz , cla@@ pping her in your hands .
okay , so there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the one on the left is ja@@ zz and the one on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side of the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side , please cla@@ p .
okay , take a few more .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz , and the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
this is a extra@@ ordin@@ arily un@@ gra@@ den@@ er categ@@ ori@@ zation of training .
those categ@@ ories have to say something to the people who are provi@@ ding their choices .
and this problem often sees you when you look at the long qu@@ eu@@ es of all these fun@@ ci@@ ds .
who do you actually want to in@@ form with it ?
my fourth technology : pro@@ gr@@ ess@@ ing for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think , we just have to simpli@@ fy them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
so let me show you an example of what i mean .
so let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the pur@@ ch@@ asing of a car .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man automo@@ bile maker that allows you to con@@ vey your car to con@@ tex@@ t her own self
you &apos;ve got to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to make your car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a decision .
automo@@ bil@@ es , outside of the automo@@ bile , i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
mot@@ ors , ge@@ ars -- four choices .
what i &apos;m doing now is changing the order in which the decisions look .
half of the custom@@ ers are going to be from many possibilities , 5@@ 6 car colors on these small possibilities , four ge@@ ases .
the other half of the custom@@ ers goes from smaller possibilities , four ge@@ ars , to the 5@@ 6 car color , a lot of possibilities .
what do i look at at that ?
how do you care about ?
if they constantly use the standard choice in choice , it means that they &apos;re over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , the he@@ ating , i lose them .
what it &apos;s finding is that the people who go from many to the low sel@@ ec@@ ties are going to go over and over and over again for the standard choice .
we are losing them .
go from having a little choice to the many , and then stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing that i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information will be .
so when i start with the easy process , i study how i choose .
even though the ves@@ sel@@ s choose , i don &apos;t mean anything about my favor@@ lo@@ ws in the inter@@ ior of inter@@ rela@@ tions , it &apos;s still going to get me to choose for me .
it also puts me forward in exc@@ it@@ ement about the great product that i &apos;m putting together , and so i &apos;m ready to be able to get involved with it .
so let me wra@@ p up .
now , i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that are over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with the issue of decisi@@ on-@@ making mil@@ ls -- con@@ cre@@ te -- do it real ; do it real ; we can do it real ; we can deal with more categ@@ ories , we can deal with more than we do on complexity .
so each of these techniques that i &apos;m telling you today is to help them make the opportunities -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for the people who make them .
because i believe that the key to the best choice is that you choose to sele@@ ct .
and the more we sel@@ ec@@ tive for sel@@ ec@@ ting , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in 16@@ c@@ ca , be@@ ating mana@@ gers in youtube . i &apos;m watching youtube comm@@ i video .
it &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how video become vi@@ ral , and then finally , that &apos;s important to us .
we all want stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , that seemed to be infin@@ itely difficult .
but web videos have allowed us to all or all our creative activi@@ ties can become in@@ trin@@ ted in a part of the culture of our world .
any of you could be famous about the internet to next se@@ vent@@ h of you .
but in youtube , over 4@@ 8 hours of video , there are more than 4@@ 8 hours of video .
it &apos;s a tiny percentage of percentage ever again , and it &apos;s going to be vie@@ wed thousands of times and so much of the cultural moment .
so , how does it work ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ maker , dist@@ ant me@@ ma@@ tions , and the un@@ expected one .
well , then let &apos;s do this .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god !
who@@ a !
aw@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ w@@ w !
last year , radio vas@@ que@@ z sent this video that he shot before he was in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te in the national park .
in 2010 , it &apos;s been vie@@ wed 23 million times .
this ch@@ art shows what it looked like when the video was popular last summer , the video was popular
in fact , art@@ ma didn &apos;t want a vi@@ ral video to do .
all he wanted was to just share one rain@@ bo@@ w .
because this is what you &apos;re doing when you &apos;re called yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te head@@ ar@@ ar@@ ts .
he had pus@@ hed all of the natural videos .
and this video was actually sent out in janu@@ ary , actually .
so , what has happened here ?
there was j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ hn@@ a .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ hn@@ a sent the t@@ we@@ et who ended up so popular the video at the end of the day .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ mel makes us look at new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s fri@@ day , fri@@ day . go@@ day . go@@ ke , fri@@ day . ge@@ t@@ tin &apos; &apos; hour . they didn &apos;t think we &apos;d go through this conversation without talking about this video , i hope that we would go through this video , i hope .
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ ks : fri@@ day , &quot; one of the most popular video of the year .
it was looked at close to 200 million vie@@ ws this year .
and this is what the graphi@@ cs looked like .
just like it said , it seems like &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , &quot; it seems like she didn &apos;t seem to be
what has happened that day ?
well , it was fri@@ day , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , those other ti@@ ps are also fre@@ e-@@ days .
but what about that day , this particular fri@@ day ?
now , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 put it up , lots of blogs started writing about it .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son of the myster@@ y of science theater was a first one to make a jo@@ ke about this at twitter .
what &apos;s important is that a single person or a group of ta@@ sted as@@ sig@@ ns a point of view , shared with a big audience , and acceler@@ ated the process .
and then this community formed from people who were doing this big insi@@ ght , and they started talking about it and playing it around and playing it around .
now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ di@@ ans of &quot; fri@@ day &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single day of a week .
unlike the 20th century involved in the 20th century , the inter@@ mission of the community is to be part of this phenomenon -- either by using it or make something new out of it .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; is anima@@ tion and music in end@@ -@@ time loo@@ p .
it &apos;s very , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times this year .
and if you do that for nu@@ ts , you must know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version of that , which has been vie@@ wed four million times .
and even cat@@ s look at this video .
cat@@ s are looking at cat@@ s looking at this video .
the importance of creativity , though , is in the internet culture of the tech@@ com@@ y and ge@@ e@@ ks .
there were re@@ mix@@ ers .
somebody was making an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned version of it .
and then , it became international .
a total re@@ mi@@ mic community sho@@ ots out of the ground that made it something that we can all participa@@ te in .
today , we don &apos;t just find a chance of doing something that we &apos;re doing .
who would have been looking at all this ?
who would have predi@@ cted &quot; frequ@@ ent rain@@ bo@@ w &quot; or &quot; n@@ bec@@ an c@@ at &quot; or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at ? &quot;
what kind of to@@ w@@ ns would you like to write to write in which one would be there ?
in a world where every minute of every minute of two 2 days of video can be u@@ plo@@ aded , only truly unique and un@@ expected fig@@ ures like the video mentioned .
i &apos;ll ad@@ mit , i wasn &apos;t really interested in the fact that a friend said to me , i &apos;m not really interested in this amazing video , about a guy standing in new york with the bi@@ kes that prote@@ sted in new york .
i got a ti@@ cket , because i &apos;m not accep@@ ted to go on a bi@@ ke , but there are no dis@@ ability that can &apos;t make you go on the bi@@ ke .
now , since this was totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey hy@@ ange@@ s was a funny idea , and his job five million times .
so this approach is true of everything new we do crea@@ tively .
and all of this leads us to one big question .
so what does that mean ?
aw@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
so what does that mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ maker , creative partici@@ pants , our communities , are completely un@@ expected , are the fe@@ atures of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has to access in the audience , ulti@@ ar@@ ity .
now , as i said , one of the biggest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- did it in youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas to the green light .
and today , we &apos;re all comfortable with our pop culture &apos;s ow@@ ner .
and these are not the fe@@ atures of the old media , and they &apos;re har@@ dly reach@@ ing the media of today , but they &apos;re going to deter@@ mine the conversation of the future .
thank you very much .
how can i talk about the inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness between women over three generations , and how the amazing strength of this inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness was mani@@ fest@@ ed in a small boat in the chinese ocean , and never disappe@@ ared in a small boat with her baby and her grandmother for five days , and never disappe@@ ared -- this little girl , who now lives in san francisco , who now lives in san francisco and talks about them today
there isn &apos;t time to be a story yet
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that &apos;s still being put together .
so i want to tell you some of the puzz@@ les here .
think of the first bit : a guy who is burning in his life &apos;s life .
he &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a man whose entire life of the simple hope of on@@ eness and the freedom of his home was set together .
think of it as being the leader of the commun@@ ist in sa@@ ig@@ on in front of him as he had to face his life that his life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , were sle@@ am@@ ed of his own .
he was getting back to sil@@ ence .
he died , broke through the story .
and he &apos;s my grand@@ father .
i never even met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
my grandmother never let me let his life let me .
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t otherwise for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to dis@@ ru@@ pt us , but we passed it .
the next puzz@@ le piece shows what a boat in the early morning horse is fall@@ ing down at sea .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- in a ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , there was two little girls in it .
for her , his life had given her a job : the flight of her family and a new life in australia .
it was totally ex@@ clu@@ ded that it could fail .
after a four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds and film dro@@ op , sa@@ ga b@@ elt , a boat fell to the sea , as a fis@@ her@@ ship .
all adults have been aware of the risks .
it was the biggest fear they had of pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
i mean , like most adults on the boat , my mom wor@@ e a little tox@@ ic fla@@ p .
in a pris@@ on@@ er , i first had my sister and myself , and then they &apos;d drink her@@ self and my grandmother .
my first memor@@ ies are from this boat -- the u@@ tili@@ ty tu@@ ck@@ ers of the engine , the cla@@ pping of one wave on the bo@@ g , the l@@ ens and empty hori@@ zon .
i don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates that came many times , but re@@ moved from the death of men on our bo@@ w , or the dec@@ line of the engine that didn &apos;t want to go for six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil species before the mal@@ ay@@ ic coast , and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apple that was in the platform to give me one of the men in the
no apple would ever ste@@ ck back like that .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we ended up in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece is about four women in three generations , and they &apos;re evol@@ ving a new life together .
we &apos;d let ourselves in foot@@ sc@@ ash far@@ es , one of the work@@ ing-@@ class distri@@ ct reser@@ ve , which is the population of im@@ migr@@ ant expec@@ ges .
unlike the traditional members of the midd@@ le-@@ class state of class , their existence completely un@@ known to me , there was no sophisti@@ cated thinking in tur@@ sc@@ ray .
the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding from the tru@@ cks came from the rest of the world .
and the f@@ at@@ ous english of english were tra@@ pped between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mom worked on far@@ ms , then on a flying line in a car factory , six days , double la@@ yers of la@@ yers .
it kind of managed to figure out the time that english and it@@ em@@ s were able to adop@@ t themselves .
we &apos;ve been poor .
every dollar was announ@@ ced and has been done in any education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to deal with , and so far , the new things came out of a second hand .
two pair of str@@ um@@ ps for school , each to den@@ y the holes in the other .
you know , a school public form up to the butt@@ on , because she had to get six years .
and there was the rare but pain@@ ful ch@@ ie@@ f of &quot; easy eye &quot; and here , &quot; asi@@ an , &quot; goes home . &quot;
where do you go home ?
something ble@@ w inside of me .
there was a meeting to re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation , and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mom , and my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
my mom was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we told each other from our day and listen@@ ed to the mov@@ ements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suff@@ ered from leg@@ e@@ ils from the boat .
and it was my job to stay up every night until her ni@@ ght@@ b@@ els came to stay , so i could catch her up .
she opened up a computer business , then she created a co@@ s@@ me@@ tic training and opened up a store .
and the women showed up with their stories about men who were not attra@@ cted to the change , an@@ gry and in@@ flexi@@ ble , and crow@@ ded children , tra@@ pped , tra@@ pped between two worl@@ ds .
lo@@ ans and spon@@ sor@@ s were se@@ arch@@ ing for .
centers have been built .
i sta@@ yed in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
in one of me , i was the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , the in@@ for@@ gi@@ ble dem@@ ands of itself .
in the other hand , i was involved in un@@ certain lives , with the tra@@ gic sc@@ inter@@ s of violence , the drug ab@@ use and the insu@@ lation .
but that &apos;s so many people got help over the years .
and because of that aid , i was awar@@ ded to graduate school in my last year as a young austr@@ alist of the year .
and i was the next cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted to the ne@@ ar@@ est cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ t , and i couldn &apos;t get the ch@@ ie@@ f whi@@ st@@ les together .
t@@ .@@ g , anony@@ mous be@@ ach@@ er of foot@@ sc@@ ray , was now tan , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist that had been invited to lec@@ tures that they had never heard of , and in their homes , their existence could never be imag@@ ined .
i didn &apos;t feel familiar with the lab@@ el .
i didn &apos;t know how to fix the bri@@ be .
i didn &apos;t know what to talk about about wine .
i didn &apos;t know about anything to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the r@@ out@@ ine and the conven@@ i@@ ence of the lives of an un@@ known reser@@ ve -- a grandmother , a mom and two dau@@ gh@@ ters who had been doing their days as 20 years &apos; time , by telling each other to each other and thre@@ w out , three of us still in the same bed .
and i said to my mom , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she remin@@ ded me that i was as old as it was when we clim@@ bed the boat .
no one &apos;s never been an option .
&quot; no it simply simple , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about ju@@ gen@@ i@@ ties and education , and the ne@@ g@@ le@@ ct of marine ne@@ gi@@ an@@ ces and an@@ x@@ im@@ ari@@ zed .
and the more open i was talking about , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all the li@@ ve@@ li@@ ods , so many of them did what they loved , they lived in the limit@@ s of what they loved .
and even though i gradu@@ ated with my degree , i realized i could not return to a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
there had to be another piece of glass there .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a out@@ si@@ der , a new@@ lin@@ ing , new picture -- not just okay , but something that you must be gr@@ ate@@ ful , perhaps a gift of the boat .
because in addition to being able to do that , to the collapse of the hori@@ zon , it can mean so easy that you accept the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment .
now , i &apos;ve gone out of my comfort area to know that , yes , the world brea@@ ks out , but not the way you feel it .
possibilities that were not allowed to be ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly encoura@@ ged .
there was a energy , an in@@ expensive optimis@@ m , a strange bl@@ ast of the hu@@ mili@@ ty and the wa@@ g@@ on .
so i started to follow my gut feeling .
and i colle@@ cted a little team of people around me , for whom the sho@@ ot@@ ing &quot; couldn &apos;t make &quot; an in@@ dul@@ gen@@ ce of challen@@ ging . &quot;
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a doctor .
at the end of every day , i co@@ ok a huge po@@ f sou@@ p that we were partici@@ pos@@ ed to .
we swi@@ t@@ ched late to night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a little bit of brilliant stuff , and we created the break@@ through .
i met the decision to pull united states to the u.@@ s .
there &apos;s just a trip there .
it &apos;s my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure went on .
before i leave the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ in of the most important person .
the life had not changed for cent@@ u@@ ries for cent@@ u@@ ries .
her father died shor@@ tly after her birth .
her mother was on her own .
she was the second wife of a mand@@ ar@@ in , whose mom she beat her .
with no man &apos;s support , she ser@@ ved them for a show by taking him to court and was as@@ s@@ ess@@ ly in her own case , and yet she won an even bigger return when she won .
&quot; does not mean &quot; it turns out to be un@@ true .
and i was just du@@ mp@@ ed in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney , when she died . 800 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and i looked through the sh@@ ell and i saw them standing on the other side .
i knew she &apos;d come to say to him .
my mom called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a budd@@ h@@ ist tem@@ le in foot@@ sc@@ ra@@ p and sat around her co@@ g .
we told her stories , and we pre@@ sure that we were still with it .
and she came down to mid@@ night at mid@@ night , and he said he had to close the sar@@ g .
my mom asked us to look at their hand .
and she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she said , &quot; well , because she said , &quot; he said .
they said , &quot; they don &apos;t let them . &quot;
if there is a band in our family , it &apos;s going to run through the women .
when you see who we were , and how the life of us sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men that might have come in our lives will come to the wat@@ ch@@ man .
the im@@ stance would have been too simple .
and now i would like my own children , and i think of the boat .
who &apos;s ever going to wish ?
now , i &apos;m afraid of privi@@ le@@ ging , pre@@ vent@@ ative , co@@ inci@@ dence .
can i give you a boo@@ ker in your life that b@@ is@@ s every wave , un@@ le@@ as@@ hing , y@@ i@@ el@@ ds the mot@@ ors , the exten@@ sion of the engine , who guar@@ an@@ tee you nothing ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that to you and make it sec@@ ure , i would do it .
in addition , t@@ an &apos;s mother is here in the fourth , or fif@@ th row .
so , i &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y with you .
is it all photograph@@ y at all ?
because this , of course , is a picture you can &apos;t pick up with his camera .
yet , my interest in photograph@@ y began when i received my first digital camera at the age of 15 years old .
i combin@@ ed it with my former pre@@ ference for drawing , but it was a little different , because when the camera was using this camera , it was a lot more in planning .
and when you take an image with a camera , the process you &apos;re going to end down on the issue .
so to me , the photograph@@ y seemed to go rather about going to be at the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could do it .
so , i wanted to create something different , something that the process begins when the tri@@ g@@ ger is being written .
so , photos like this : a construction place along the way along a much remote road .
but it &apos;s got an un@@ expected turn .
and yet , it does a reali@@ stic level .
or pictures like this -- dark and color@@ ful at the same time , but anyone with the common dest@@ ination to keep a reali@@ stic level .
when i say reality , i &apos;ll say ton@@ o reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i want to look at it as if you could have done that , in a photograph .
it &apos;s photographs that you have to think of a brief moment to try to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s kind of like cat@@ ching an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it reali@@ stic ?
is it all about the details or the colors ?
so is it about the light ?
what &apos;s constru@@ cted in the illusion ?
and sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but it &apos;s really about how we interpre@@ t the world , and how they can be made in a two-@@ dimensional space tan@@ gi@@ ble environment .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s reali@@ stic , but what we think is reali@@ stic .
so , i think the essen@@ ti@@ als are very simple .
and i see you as a myster@@ y of reality where you can take multiple pieces and assem@@ ble it to create an alternative reality .
and so let me show you a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three very imag@@ in@@ able physical objects here that we can all identify in a three-@@ dimensional world .
but in a certain way , combin@@ ed together , you can create something that &apos;s still three-@@ dimensional as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ rate our brains , because our brains just don &apos;t think it makes sense to happen .
and i see the same process in com@@ bine of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combin@@ ing different kinds of reali@@ ties .
so the things that make a reali@@ stic sense , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things that we don &apos;t think about in our life .
but if we com@@ bine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise they &apos;re kind of looking wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to hi@@ de in order to achieve a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
so , as you can see , these are not three kinds of images .
so you can com@@ bine something special about this , but you can do something special as this .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ed ima@@ ging should have the same perspective .
second of all , combin@@ ated photographs of the same ligh@@ ting form .
and these two pain@@ t@@ ings ac@@ compli@@ shed these two dem@@ ands -- sho@@ ot from the same al@@ titude and the same ligh@@ ting way .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to make a difference where the individual images begin and end by conne@@ cting them se@@ am@@ less@@ ly .
does it impossible to tell you what the picture was actually put together .
so by tac@@ kl@@ ing color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ cks at the ed@@ ges of the ed@@ ges , the birds inclu@@ de the boundar@@ y , de@@ pri@@ ved of colors and dis@@ orders , we &apos;re cros@@ sing the bor@@ ders between the different images , even though a picture can actually con@@ tain hundreds of rain .
now , here &apos;s another example .
you might think it &apos;s just a landscape of a landscape , and the bottom one has been put in it .
but this picture is actually completely assem@@ bled from photographs of different lo@@ cations .
and i personally fin@@ er it that it &apos;s easier to create a place than a place , because you don &apos;t have to com@@ promise any tra@@ des@@ off@@ s with the ideas in his head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and when i got this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to try to design them to find different places for the prin@@ ts of the puzz@@ le .
for example , the fish had been taken on an in@@ fl@@ am@@ er@@ er@@ al flight .
the wat@@ ers is from another place .
the under@@ water part was made of a quar@@ ry .
and yeah , i actually spra@@ yed the house on the top of the island to make it look like swe@@ dis@@ h .
in order to get a reali@@ stic result , it turns out , from me , it turns out to be planning .
so , i always start with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
and then it &apos;s all about the combin@@ ation of different images .
and here &apos;s every piece of very well plan@@ ned .
and then when you make a good time , it can be pretty beautiful , and fairly reali@@ stic is also fairly reali@@ stic .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that &apos;s going to be limited to us is our imagination .
thank you very much .
so i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects failed .
and i think the most important point here is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced at the whe@@ b@@ ou@@ d university was to put a great listen@@ er .
it &apos;s not really what science is about -- it &apos;s a c@@ up of coffee or te@@ a and respon@@ ds to the patients , families , rela@@ tives , &quot; how about that ?
how are we going to help you ? &quot;
and we think we &apos;d like to think that this is one of the main issues why everyone -- perhaps most of the electr@@ onic health projects failed : because we stopped listening .
this is my w@@ lan@@ -@@ scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing to do .
she &apos;s got a butt@@ on , and she &apos;s out of john .
and every morning , i &apos;m going to jump on that .
and yeah , i &apos;ve got a job , as you may recognize .
now , i put my job at 9@@ king .
it &apos;s a simple thing to do : every time i go on the same time , you send my data to google health .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re going to tell you about my general community so that it can dete@@ ct me where i am a car@@ di@@ ology problem , not just the time in which i need car@@ di@@ ology support or anything , but also with a gli@@ mp@@ se of the past .
but there &apos;s one other thing .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with that , i &apos;ve got over 4@@ ,000 scho@@ ol@@ s who are on twitter .
so every morning , i &apos;m going to go to my w@@ lan@@ t age , and people talk to me before i sit in a car , &quot; to lunch , just a little sal@@ ek today , lu@@ ci@@ as . &quot;
but this is the dig@@ ni@@ est thing that can happen , because this is a group of pe@@ al to help patients , because that could be used against o@@ bes@@ ity , or it could be used for o@@ bes@@ ity to get the smo@@ ke away .
but it may also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs and get them to make some kind of game game in order to control their health better .
next week , that &apos;s going to happen to the market .
it &apos;s going to give you this little blood prin@@ ting re@@ plac@@ ement that you inclu@@ de to an iphone or something like that .
and it &apos;s going to en@@ able people to measure their blood pressure from home , to send it to their physi@@ cian and share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
so at this point , the patients come in play . they can &apos;t just be able to take control of their own ship , but to help us with health care , but to help us with the challenge of the challenge that &apos;s behind us , and the cost of public health , dou@@ bling demand , and so on .
make some ways that are easy to use and begin to hu@@ g patients in the team .
and that &apos;s what you can do with these sorts of ways , but also by crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you through a very short video .
so we &apos;ve got all the navi@@ g@@ ating systems in our cars .
in fact , in our cell phones , maybe in our
we know pre@@ cis@@ ely where all the at@@ ta@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ at@@ ms are around ma@@ a@@ stri@@ h .
we know one other place where all the gas is .
and sure enough , we can find fast food cha@@ ins .
but where would be the next a@@ ed to help this patient ?
we asked around , and no one knew about it .
nobody knew where to find the next life &apos;s life@@ -@@ saving a@@ ed at that moment .
so what did we do ? we did crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
we &apos;ve built a website and asked a crowd of people , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please share us where he is when he &apos;s closed , of course , he &apos;s closed , of course , during the business of business , of course .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds , they sig@@ ned up in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
and the next step was to find the app@@ s for this .
and we &apos;ve created an i@@ pa@@ d ap@@ p .
we &apos;ve developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht , and someone brea@@ ks together , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , your micro@@ -@@ software cell phone will be able to save the next a@@ ed that can save lives .
and today , we don &apos;t want to use this as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , which is called the product , but we also want to introdu@@ ce as an a@@ per@@ 4@@ us .
and we want to get this down to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us think about how no@@ che &apos;s spo@@ ts to be@@ have around the world , to crow@@ d@@ source these a@@ e@@ ds around the world .
and when you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and someone collap@@ ses , it may be your own relationships or somebody else , you can find an a@@ ed like that .
the other thing that we want to ask about is that companies around the world are helping us with con@@ fir@@ ma@@ tion of this a@@ e@@ ds .
these could be hy@@ ri@@ er@@ -@@ service , or techni@@ cians , for example , just to make sure that the profi@@ zed a@@ ed is still on the place in his place .
please help us , and try to take health , not just better , to take it in your hand .
thank you very much .
today , i &apos;m going to report from un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
i &apos;m working in the solar technolog@@ ary industry .
and my little star@@ tu@@ p would want us to force ourselves to conser@@ ve by ...
there &apos;s a lot of crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing en@@ vel@@ op@@ es .
here &apos;s just a quick video of what we &apos;re doing .
oh , wait a minute .
it may take it until it &apos;s la@@ pped .
now -- we can just jump this -- i &apos;m just going to jump through the video , please .
no , no .
it &apos;s not ...
al@@ right .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time has been over here ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take off a year and work in a neighborhood that is pretty much anything that they actually hate , we &apos;ve been able to work with them in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace sc@@ or@@ es of ge@@ e@@ ks .
we pick some fel@@ lo@@ ws every year , and we leave them with city admini@@ stration .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them in ra@@ th@@ ts@@ ops .
and they came up with great app@@ s , worked with urban workers .
but what you really do is show what you can do with technology today .
so they &apos;re going to meet al .
and al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city .
it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is someone who is spon@@ sor@@ ing him when he &apos;s restri@@ cted , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at brand@@ ing when he &apos;s standing off by a foot of a s@@ mile .
how did he get to look at this particular way of looking for aid this particular way ?
last year we had a team of le@@ lo@@ ws in boston , the &quot; code for america &quot; programs .
and they were there in febru@@ ary , and it was a lot of s@@ ni@@ p@@ time last febru@@ ary .
and they realize that the city never puts these hy@@ dr@@ ars as well .
but a particular san@@ t , a man named er@@ ik kit@@ el@@ ous &apos;s sur@@ fer , noticed something else , and that was that the resi@@ dents were free to the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these divi@@ des .
so , he did what everybody good develop@@ ers would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p , where you can adop@@ t a hy@@ dr@@ ant .
you &apos;re free to s@@ nat@@ ch him when it &apos;s s@@ ni@@ p@@ shed .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , then you can take it away .
so , there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a mo@@ ol@@ ful little ap@@ p .
it &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s , which the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
but she does something that no other govern@@ ment technology does .
it &apos;s exp@@ and@@ ing rapi@@ dly .
there &apos;s this guy in i@@ .@@ t@@ . di@@ vision of the city hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who saw that he could use this ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but for the citizens in the tsun@@ of tsun@@ mi@@ cs .
it &apos;s a very important thing that these libr@@ aries are working , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies .
this is how he got the citizens to test them .
and then se@@ attle decided to use the ap@@ p , to get the citizens to clean the pl@@ ug@@ ged part of the pen@@ l@@ books .
and chicago she just introduced the bu@@ er@@ di@@ an hei@@ ghts when it s@@ ni@@ p@@ pl@@ ed .
now we &apos;re now familiar with nine cities that are planning to use this ap@@ p .
and she has gradu@@ ally addi@@ cted , organic , of course .
if you know about the government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
the com@@ po@@ sting of software takes a couple of years to make it happen .
we had a team that worked last year on a project last year , which three people needed about two and a half months .
it was about a way of being able to find out what the right public schools are for their children .
we were told later that if it was going to go over the normal chan@@ n@@ els , it would have taken over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not something that &apos;s yet .
there &apos;s currently a project in the california law , which tax@@ pa@@ yers have now cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of the government .
so an ap@@ p that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread by sel@@ ens , it &apos;s a kind of sh@@ ell in front of the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no longer like private companies , as many people think it should be .
and not even like a techni@@ cian company , it &apos;s rather like the internet itself .
and that means that attra@@ ction , which means open and produ@@ c@@ tively .
and this is very important .
but more importantly , this ap@@ p is that she represents a new generation that puts the problem of government -- not as the problem of a com@@ pres@@ sed institution , but as a problem of collective trade .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at inter@@ acting with digital technology .
now there are a large community of people who make the tools that we need to effectively pac@@ k things in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; r@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people around the country who are getting up and they write government app@@ s everyday every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give the government up .
you &apos;re terri@@ fied fru@@ strated with her , but you don &apos;t com@@ pla@@ in about it , you re@@ pair them .
and these guys know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all feel your feelings about politics and the sna@@ ke of work and all the other things that we really get forward about , is government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ ri@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do together , which we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given the government to run .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you think about it , because things are changing .
politics does not change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally makes their power out of us -- re@@ mind you , &quot; we have the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and like many people , i thought the government was mostly about choo@@ sing people into a sto@@ ve .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ sion that it &apos;s particularly in commun@@ al commun@@ es to do th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ers .
this is the call center for manufac@@ ture and information .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re normally caught when you jum@@ ped 3@@ 11 in your city .
if you &apos;ve ever had an opportunity to work in your urban call center , like our style scot@@ t sil@@ ver@@ man as part of the program -- you &apos;ll all do that -- you &apos;re going to see that the people in the government revol@@ ts for many different problems , including that there &apos;s a predat@@ or in your house .
so scot@@ t get this fru@@ me .
he said , &quot; th@@ ush , &quot; in the offi@@ cial dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and he &apos;s really not really an idea . he starts with the veter@@ in@@ ary .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the do@@ ors in your house and play very l@@ oud music and see if the li@@ ve@@ stock &apos;s going to roll off ? &quot;
and this worked . s@@ lam@@ t for scot@@ t .
but that was not the end of the mar@@ g@@ in@@ a@@ sts .
in boston , it didn &apos;t just have a call center .
it &apos;s got an ap@@ p , a web , and a cell robot , called &quot; skep@@ tic . &quot;
we did not write this ap@@ p .
this is the work of a very smart people in the office of new urban group in boston .
one day -- that &apos;s a real report -- came up with this : &quot; i guess in my g@@ arb@@ age foot . can &apos;t tell you whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; mem@@ inter@@ s &quot; is different .
scot@@ t was involved in man to man .
but on &quot; kni@@ me@@ tic &quot; everything is open , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it looked like a neighb@@ or .
and the next one that we got was , &quot; i went over there , and the g@@ arb@@ age tree was behind the house . &quot;
mark@@ kee@@ pers ? yes . life ? y@@ ap .
it turned the g@@ arb@@ age on the page . it went home .
good night , swe@@ et mar@@ g@@ in . &quot;
pretty stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital thing that &apos;s going to be physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is putting into crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
but also , it &apos;s a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t really mean here in a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m really talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
it was a citi@@ zen to create a different citi@@ zen , but the government played in here a central role .
and she connected these two people .
and you could have aff@@ or@@ ded it with government , if these were needed , but a neighb@@ or is a much better and che@@ aper alternative to the public services .
if one neighb@@ or helps the other devices , we streng@@ di@@ fy our communities .
so let &apos;s call the animal cre@@ ature , it &apos;s going to cost a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think about the government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe this is one of the other &apos;s values .
that our contribu@@ tion to the system is the vote .
how often have we vot@@ ed a political campaign -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;ll re@@ connect , and we expect the government to be refle@@ cted , and then our needs are ful@@ l-@@ time , and then hasn &apos;t changed much ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a higher ocean , and politics are the top 15 centi@@ meters .
and what &apos;s below is what we call the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
and we use that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
but it &apos;s this con@@ temp@@ t that we own and we pay for something that is working against us , working against us , something else , and then we extra@@ cted ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sex@@ y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy sex@@ y .
because this is where the current government has been happening .
we need to put ourselves on the machin@@ ery of government .
so , the pris@@ py@@ thes@@ i@@ le movement has done it .
have you ever seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of wor@@ thy citizens who wrote a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report , which is an answer to the cell@@ -@@ zo@@ o about the leg@@ is@@ lation of the financial re@@ form .
this is not poli@@ tically active , this is bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic .
now , for those of us who &apos;ve given the government , it &apos;s time that we &apos;re thinking about the world we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to imagine the enormous challenges you &apos;re going to have to ask .
do we really believe that we reach what we need to get without to improve the institution that &apos;s going to benefit from all of us ?
a government is absolutely essential , but it has to become efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to embra@@ ce the function of government in a way that can actually make a difference by en@@ han@@ cing society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things in common , you just have to build these things proper@@ ly .
now , the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with this to see their voice for gran@@ ted .
they &apos;re not fighting this battle that we all fight about who can talk to who they are all to speak .
you can make your opini@@ on , every chan@@ nel in every chan@@ nel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
and they use their hands .
they use their hands to write and write appli@@ cations that improve the government &apos;s work .
and these app@@ s will let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be rele@@ ased by a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant , cr@@ as@@ hing the we@@ d@@ ding , turning a tr@@ un@@ k with a th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ist .
and sur@@ ely , we &apos;d have these fire hy@@ dr@@ ants all the time , and a lot of people do this .
but these app@@ s are like little digital memor@@ ies that we are not just consum@@ ers , and we are not just consum@@ ers that are cap@@ turing and not just consum@@ ers &apos; support .
we are more than we are . we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve government .
so the question that i &apos;ve all got for all of you here : if it comes to the big , important things we need to do together , all together , are we only going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
why thank you .
it &apos;s usually my role in expla@@ ining people how wonder@@ fully the new technologies that are on the rise are going to be , and i thought , since i &apos;m here , i would also try to look back and understand what &apos;s really going on with these incredible jum@@ ps , which is so ra@@ king that we can har@@ dly be able to be able to sa@@ ke up .
so i &apos;m going to start by showing you a little , kind of , thinking of a slide .
... if you could just show the slide for a second .
this is a slide i &apos;ve cho@@ sen out of my fol@@ der .
i &apos;m not here to talk about the details of the slide , but rather to me about the general form .
this slide shows data to an analysis of the performance of ris@@ c process@@ ors in compar@@ ison with the performance of an aging level of networks .
now , what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like so many , which we often arri@@ ve in our field , is a kind of se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve .
in other words , each step here appe@@ ars to be a poten@@ cy in the performance .
and this is a no@@ vel@@ ty that we need to use this guy on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves at the area of technology .
something very strange happens over here .
so this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could do the light again , you could do the light again .
another little bit of star@@ cher , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here .
now why are we drawing gra@@ pher@@ s in technology using se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves ?
and the reason is , if i would draw it in a normal cur@@ ve , where , say , this is the years , the ti@@ mel@@ ine of a kind , and this is sort of a piece of view of the technology that i want to run with a gra@@ ce , then the graph will be al@@ ver@@ i@@ zed .
they &apos;re looking like this .
and that doesn &apos;t really tell us a lot .
now , if i want to open up another technology , let &apos;s say a transpor@@ tation technology , that would come aw@@ dly un@@ sensi@@ ble in the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ se exchange , in form of a flat line .
but when something like this happens here , this changes the qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative environment .
so if the transpor@@ tation technology pro@@ gr@@ esses as fast as the micro@@ process@@ or technology , we could get in a tax@@ i morning , and we would be in a to@@ k@@ yo in 30 seconds .
but that &apos;s not going to be so fast .
this has never happened before in the history of technology , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth , which is exponenti@@ ally increasing in terms of scale for each few years .
so the question that i &apos;d like to ask you now is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you see , they don &apos;t go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going on forever and after all , as fast as now .
there are two ways of this .
either it &apos;s going to be a classi@@ c cur@@ ve like this , until something completely new comes , or it &apos;s going to be happening here .
that &apos;s kind of about it .
now , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think this will happen in the way that i &apos;m going to happen .
it &apos;s like , we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right here right now .
we are on this line here , in a transition from the world &apos;s advanced world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and also often , is how this new world is going to be true , right ?
what &apos;s this new condition that the world &apos;s getting on slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very conf@@ using when you &apos;re in the middle of your life .
when i was a child , the future was somewhere in 2000 , and people were often talking about what was going to happen in 2000 .
now we &apos;ve got a conference here where people are talking about the future , and what you find is that the future is still in 2000 .
but we &apos;re not going to go further than that
so in other words , the future is re@@ stor@@ ed by a year since i &apos;m in the world since i &apos;m in the world .
i think the reason for that is that we realize that something is going on there .
it &apos;s going to be happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that right now there &apos;s just no meaning to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is going to be so different that there &apos;s a simple amount of gener@@ ation from what we now don &apos;t make any sense .
now , i want to talk about what that might be like , that transition that we face right now .
to make this happen first , i &apos;m going to talk about a couple of the other things that really don &apos;t have anything to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to take a step back and look at it at a longer time scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the time scale of earth &apos;s life .
and i think the big picture makes sense when you divi@@ de it into a few billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.@@ 5 billion years , and the earth was a big , ster@@ -@@ ster@@ er l@@ um@@ p with lots of chemicals flo@@ ating on this flo@@ ating chemicals
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then this gives us a pretty good picture of how they thought it would happen .
and i think there are theor@@ ies that are beginning to understand how all of the things started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simpli@@ fied narra@@ tive about what is that , at that time , little squ@@ ir@@ es that inclu@@ ded different kinds of reci@@ pes for chemicals .
some of these squ@@ ir@@ es contain@@ ed a special combin@@ ation of chemicals that allowed them to integra@@ te and grow other chemicals from out@@ put and to grow .
all those were , they started to divi@@ de .
these little oil dro@@ ps were in the sense of the most primi@@ tive cell form .
however , these oil dro@@ cks are not about living in today &apos;s importance , because each one of them was just a small , random repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tional of chemicals .
and every time it divi@@ ded , the chemicals that exi@@ sted in exi@@ sting chemicals with dis@@ par@@ ate amo@@ unts .
so each dro@@ p@@ let was slightly different dro@@ pping .
in fact , the dro@@ p@@ ball@@ s grew up , which was an opti@@ tin@@ ous com@@ position faster than others and increas@@ ed more and more and more chemicals from out@@ put and divi@@ ded up faster .
so those ten@@ ds to survive longer , and they tend to multi@@ p@@ ly themselves in much larger propor@@ tion .
so this is just a simple chemical form of life , but more interest@@ ingly , if these dro@@ p@@ pl@@ ates have learned a trick about abstra@@ ction , it turns out .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , these dro@@ p@@ ball@@ s have learned the ability to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the reci@@ pe of the cell as the information in a certain chemical shape , which we call dna .
in other words , they had found a way in this sort of intellectual , evolutionary way that allowed them to ad@@ v@@ ance what they were capable of , so that this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ i@@ ed .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information to store over the time of 2.@@ 5 billion years ago , where it &apos;s formed , immediately .
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us is for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code , and the same ty@@ p@@ ard .
and each of the creatures uses exactly the same characters and the same code .
we are so far that we can only write ourselves in this code , in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of a white pul@@ se here , which i try to keep up in air@@ por@@ ts from security ch@@ ari@@ ties .
so there &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is made up of normal letters that we &apos;re using -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants to map a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i &apos;ve got enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a e@@ go , i would have written them to a virus and rele@@ ase them in the room .
so , what &apos;s the next step ?
the ru@@ cking of the dna was an interesting step .
and this gave cells -- it made them happy for another billion years to do .
but then another , very interesting step happened , where things were completely different , and so these cells started to communicate and interact with information so that communities were created by cells .
and i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve knew this , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
and that &apos;s why , for instance , the consi@@ sten@@ cy to antibio@@ tics is gro@@ unded .
some bacteria have figured out how can they stay from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and they &apos;ve been writing this information with other bacteria in the dna , and now we &apos;ve got lots of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because the bacteria are communic@@ ating with each other .
so , this communication allowed the reason of communities , which , in a certain sense , were in the same boat ; they were sy@@ ner@@ d@@ ish .
so they either survi@@ ved together , or they went down , and that meant that if a community succe@@ e@@ ded , all individuals of the community were repe@@ ated and pre@@ fer@@ red from evolution .
the over@@ head is now where these communities re@@ turned as close to the fact that they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the whole community into a lab@@ el on the dna .
and so the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities from many different cell systems , which are self-@@ active together as individual organis@@ m .
in fact , we are also a multi-@@ poly@@ g@@ ous community .
we &apos;ve got a lot of cells , which are no longer put on their own .
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells , and so on .
so these communities began to evol@@ ve , so that the level that evolution was happening was no longer the single cell , but the entire cell community , which we call organis@@ m .
so the next step has happened in these communities now .
the cell communities started to abstra@@ ct information again .
and they developed special structures that did nothing other than process@@ ing information within the organis@@ m .
and these are like the neu@@ ral structure .
so the ner@@ ve cells are the information ta@@ il@@ age of information that has built these cell cells .
and they started educ@@ ating speci@@ alists within the community , specific structures , which were responsible for learning , understand , and building information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
so this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that time , an individual -- learning now happened within time &apos;s li@@ fes@@ pan of a single organis@@ m , rather than above that evolutionary period .
so an organis@@ m could not learn to eat a specific amount of fru@@ ni@@ ty because they kept bad and made it sick , the last time he had e@@ aten it .
this could now be within a single organis@@ m of a single organis@@ m , where hundreds of thousands of years before , because this information had to be learned by the individuals that died because of these fru@@ its , because these information process@@ ing structure had not been present yet .
so , the nervous system really has the evolutionary process with this particular information structure , because evolution has now been able to live inside of a field .
it could work in a ti@@ mel@@ ine , a time of learning .
what was happening then is that the individual organisms had to figure out a way to communicate with each other .
so , as an example , the nar@@ ff@@ yp@@ tes told us about this communication of communication is human language .
it &apos;s kind of a amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated and un@@ er@@ r@@ a@@ tic idea here in my head .
and i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically pus@@ hing some exc@@ it@@ ement sounds of myself hop@@ ing to create a similar kind of an in@@ spir@@ ed idea in your mind that has a certain sense of simil@@ ari@@ ties with my original idea .
so we take a little bit tri@@ cky , we conver@@ t it to sounds , a sequence of sound , and then you make something very complicated in the heads of others .
so , this allows us to be able to do as uni@@ fied organis@@ m .
and what we actually did is , we , humanity , is , we started abstra@@ cting .
we actually go through the same st@@ ages that have been through multi-@@ cell organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds , present data , present the data .
so , the invention of language , for example , was a little step in that direction .
tele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , video edi@@ tors , c@@ d-@@ ro@@ ms , and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we built in our communities to share this information .
and it conne@@ cts us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger and can continue to evol@@ ve faster than we &apos;ve been there .
so no@@ wa@@ days evolution can be done in the time of micro@@ seconds .
you also saw t@@ .@@ ken &apos;s little evolutionary example of where he showed a little bit of evolution in the con@@ vol@@ tu program , right in front of your eyes .
so we &apos;re s@@ hr@@ in@@ king the fast sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding .
the first steps in history , which i told you about , took a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , had a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language , and so on , didn &apos;t stop less than a million years .
and then these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to take very few decades .
the process will be used by itself , and it turns out , i think auto@@ -@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for -- if something incre@@ ases its changes speed .
so the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explo@@ ri@@ cal cur@@ ve .
we &apos;re seeing the process that feed itself from themselves .
i &apos;m living profession@@ ally from building computers , and i know that i can use the mechan@@ ism that i use to build computers , can &apos;t use , without the recent advan@@ ces in compu@@ tation .
my current work is to design objects with such a very high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in traditional meaning .
i don &apos;t know what each individual transi@@ st@@ or is doing in the com@@ bine machine .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
what i &apos;m going to do , and what the designers are doing of thinking of thinking , is that we think at a certain abstra@@ ct level , trans@@ fer@@ ring to this machine , and the machine is making something that over@@ comes our cap@@ abilities much better , better and faster than we can ever do it .
and it makes it par@@ tly different with metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t even understand until that .
one of the ways that is particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using for a long time , is evolution itself .
so we imple@@ late an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the mi@@ th@@ th@@ ital area .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that has been evol@@ ving out of the in@@ struc@@ tions .
we say , &quot; computers , generally , put together a hundred million feedback from in@@ struc@@ tions .
now , please run all of these random in@@ struc@@ tions , lead all programs , and don@@ ally follow the ones that my pres@@ ent@@ ations are the clo@@ s@@ est . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want to do .
let &apos;s say i want to make numbers on this , and this is a simple example that i &apos;ve used for that already .
so that &apos;s where programs can hand@@ le the very od@@ d@@ ful numbers .
of course , the chance for random in@@ struc@@ tions is very small , that it &apos;s very small , that it &apos;s actually not going to take numbers apart , so they probably don &apos;t get the in@@ struc@@ tions to actually do this .
but one of them li@@ kes to be with a little bit of happiness two numbers in the right order .
now , i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which i &apos;ve come across the clo@@ s@@ est side of the sequences .
keep that off , fix the rest .
now , the rest of the resi@@ dents that have been doing best is the best that has hand@@ ed the numbers .
it &apos;s associated with a method of re@@ combin@@ ing , anal@@ o@@ g to re@@ produce . &quot;
take two programs , and they make kids through exchange exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the children are in@@ her@@ ited the fe@@ atures of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es from the two programs .
so i &apos;ve now got a new generation of programs that emer@@ ged through combin@@ ations of programs that have come up a little bit closer to these advan@@ ces than others .
you say , &quot; please re@@ build this process . &quot;
spread it back .
take some mu@@ tations for maybe a few mu@@ tations .
and try and try to do it again with another generation .
all of these generations are requi@@ red only a few milli@@ seconds .
and so i can spend evolution over millions of years of evolution through a few minutes , or in more complex cases , a couple of hours .
eventually , i &apos;m making maps that can wei@@ gh numbers in the same way .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i can ever have dre@@ am@@ ed of .
so when i look at this program , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
it &apos;s in@@ wor@@ or@@ ed and od@@ d-@@ ful programs .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
and i know , and i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing the job because they come from a series of hundreds of progra@@ cations of programs that made the job .
because their life depen@@ ded on whether she was doing the job proper@@ ly .
now , i sat together in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 sum@@ together with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , and he turns out a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s , &quot; this airplane consi@@ sts of hundreds of thousands of small parts that work together to make their air@@ lines more sec@@ ure . &quot; don &apos;t you care about that ? &quot;
we know that a transition process is not opti@@ mal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process that is wid@@ ely different from classi@@ cal engineering .
he allows us to do things with much higher complexity than we would allow the normal metho@@ ds to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of that yet .
so , somehow the technology over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ling us .
so we use these programs to make the computers much faster , so that we can be able to do these processes as much faster .
so it spa@@ w@@ ns a feed@@ lo@@ cker .
it &apos;s getting faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so puzz@@ ling .
because all of these new technologies of today are fe@@ eding themselves from themselves .
we are going up .
we &apos;ve arrived at one point , the anal@@ o@@ g is at the time , as a cell cell organisms , a cell cell organisms .
so we &apos;re the amin@@ u@@ gs , and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell we &apos;re doing is actually to create .
we &apos;re right in the middle of this line .
but i really think that after us is going to get there .
i find it very high from us to say that we are the end@@ -@@ product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of whatever i think comes next .
now , lunch is dying before , and i think i &apos;m listening to you here before i &apos;m going to get out .
so my story starts right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , about two years ago .
i was together under the star@@ stri@@ an sk@@ or@@ ed in desert with su@@ ta@@ i sing@@ ers mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
we talked about it , nothing changed since the ancient indian system of ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a .
and if we wanted to travel india at the time , we jum@@ ped into a car and s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed across the sky .
now we &apos;re going to do it with air@@ planes .
back then , when the great indian press prin@@ ce ar@@ ra had bought , he took a ven@@ l , sho@@ cked in the floor and water .
so now we &apos;re going to do it with dri@@ ll dri@@ ll and machines .
and we came up with this conclu@@ sion that magic and magic were re@@ placed with machines .
and that made me really sad .
i got a little bit of fear of technology .
it sc@@ ared me that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun@@ stri@@ t without the camera and without a t@@ we@@ et to my friends .
i thought technology should be able to make magic and don &apos;t kill .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ ck@@ a@@ o .
this piece of 5@@ 0-@@ year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing for me .
it became a gol@@ t access to a world full of ri@@ des and trou@@ bli@@ ous ships and images in my imagination .
what stru@@ ck me was as if our volunte@@ ers were holding us and dre@@ aming of dre@@ aming from them .
they kept us to be inspired by it .
and so i set myself into the world of technology to see how i could use it , rather than killing magic instead of killing magic .
when i was 16 , i started illu@@ stration to illu@@ strate books .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a tool for story@@ telling to connect the re@@ a@@ ders around the world .
it can know how we think it would be .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking pictures and tex@@ ts together , and anima@@ tion , sound and touch .
story@@ telling needed to be a story@@ telling .
but what are we doing with that ?
now , i &apos;m going to go to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
it &apos;s like , &quot; share your fing@@ ers on any light . &quot;
and so , it says , &quot; this box is heard ! &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to figure out a character in the book .
again , a letter falls for me -- and the i@@ pad knows through gps where i live -- which is right to me -- that &apos;s right to me
now , the kid in me is really excited about these possibilities .
now , i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean ma@@ gi@@ cians and dra@@ g@@ ons , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
fire@@ flies in a glass found me very exciting , and i would find it quite exciting .
here &apos;s how you &apos;ve got to b@@ low up the i@@ pad here and make the fire@@ flies out .
and the ligh@@ ting rou@@ tes through the rest of the book .
another idea that &apos;s fascinating to me as a child is to be able to put a whole grain in a single mar@@ g .
and so , every book here , and every book , and every world , i &apos;m going to take a little les@@ k here to the ma@@ gical device in the machine .
and this op@@ ens up a map .
you know , fan@@ tas@@ i@@ fs always had maps , but these maps were sta@@ tic .
and this map exp@@ ands and ill@@ umin@@ ates and ser@@ ves to ori@@ ent@@ ation in the rest of the book .
it turns out there &apos;s other parts of the book as well .
i &apos;m here in the middle .
and also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that is indian , but it &apos;s also very seas@@ on@@ ally ti@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed
so these are the ap@@ col@@ as .
we &apos;ve heard of f@@ ari@@ es and n@@ y@@ mp@@ s , but how many people in india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ col@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were caught in in@@ dr@@ as for thousands of years in an old mu@@ ff@@ s-@@ book .
and we bring it back , in a con@@ temporary story for children .
it &apos;s a story that has dis@@ crimin@@ ate with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
the theme of environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , they &apos;re going to go out of their computers without out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children to connect to the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re going to send out a search . you &apos;ve got to go out and collect with the camera of the i@@ pa@@ ds of natural objects .
as a child , i had colle@@ ctions of wor@@ kers , pa@@ st@@ ures , sh@@ am@@ es and mu@@ ff@@ ling .
and somehow that &apos;s not what children do .
this is a childhood ritual coming back . you have to go out and tag a picture of a flo@@ wer from a chap@@ ter .
in another chap@@ ter , you &apos;ve got to be photograph@@ e-@@ scan@@ ning and tag@@ ging a piece of tree island .
so that &apos;s actually how you create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs you can then ask online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a fu@@ ch@@ or , and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fo@@ ol today . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; today , i &apos;ve seen a hero . &quot;
and this creates a kind of social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photographs you actually recor@@ ded .
there are a variety of ways of magic to connect the world and the technology with one another .
so , in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where you use the video of the i@@ pa@@ ds , and you see an aug@@ mental reality anima@@ tion that appe@@ ars to a plant in front of the house .
at one point , the screen is fil@@ ter@@ ed with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the win@@ ds , you &apos;re going to b@@ low it away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural nature of technology can come close and can be in the magic and technology itself .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world and to the magic and fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you very much .
this is really an extra@@ ordin@@ arily obs@@ essi@@ ve to me
i spend most of my time talking to people in a lec@@ ture , pris@@ on@@ ers or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the soci@@ al we@@ ak@@ est in the social sett@@ le@@ ments and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hop@@ eless .
here at ted to see and hear how stimul@@ ated this is , it gave me a lot of power to make it a lot
in the short time here , i &apos;ve been here , one of the principles , of ted has an identity .
what you can say here is things that have influence in the world .
and sometimes , when something about ted comes , there will be a meaning and strength that hasn &apos;t happened otherwise .
i say that because i believe that identity is a very important thing .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing pres@@ ent@@ ations .
i think that we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher &apos;s signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce , but that &apos;s particularly relevant the words of a dic@@ ent teacher .
you know , as a doctor , you can do good things , but you can still do something about it .
and so that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t study this in my work as a law@@ yer , by the way .
i &apos;ve learned this from my grandmother .
i became large in a family , an traditional afri@@ can@@ -@@ american hou@@ se@@ hold , who was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ ar@@ di@@ an , and that matri@@ ar@@ in was my grandmother .
she was a pi@@ pe , a strong woman , she had influence .
she had the last word in every family fight .
it was also the orig@@ in of many argu@@ ments in our family .
she was the daughter of a sla@@ ve family .
their parents have been born in virg@@ ini@@ a in 18@@ 4@@ 0s as a sla@@ ve .
it was born around 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very sha@@ ped a lot of the world &apos;s image .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also lo@@ ving .
if i met her as a young boy , she came up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
she made me realize so hard i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the , and then she left me .
and one or two hours later , when i approach@@ ed her , she came up to me and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , you feel my hu@@ g ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she re@@ gre@@ ts me again , and when i said , &quot; yes , she left me alone .
she was something that you were always going to want to be in her way .
the only problem with that was that they had 10 children .
my mom was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her last 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention to it .
my cou@@ s@@ ins passed around all over the place .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine that i wo@@ ke up in a morning and went into living room . all my cou@@ s@@ ins roll@@ ed around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room , and i star@@ ed .
at first , i thought this was a game .
and i looked at her and s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very seriously .
this went on for about 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up , and she came over to me . she took me to hand and said , &quot; come , br@@ y@@ an . you and me , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember if it was yesterday , i think it was like yesterday
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
and she took me outside , and she said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t say it . &quot;
i said , &quot; i promis@@ ed , om@@ a . &quot;
she said , &quot; hon@@ en@@ u ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and she sat down at me and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i saw you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
and she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you don &apos;t have to give me three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , ma , man . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m told that you will love your mom forever . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom &apos;s my baby , and you have to promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of them . &quot;
and i ad@@ ore my mom , so i said , &quot; yeah , ma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next , i &apos;m suggest@@ ing that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; too , if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; yeah , om@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to address me is &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , om@@ a . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother that &apos;s older , and one year yo@@ unger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this new seat of pain@@ t@@ ings with me , and my sister and went to the wo@@ ods .
we only al@@ il@@ ed around it as well as anybody else .
and then he took a poin@@ k be@@ er and off@@ ering my sister , and she as@@ sum@@ ed , and then they sig@@ ned me up , and then they give me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . just get it . i don &apos;t want be@@ er . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well let &apos;s do this . now we do everything , you do everything we do .
i had something , your sister had something . go , drin@@ ks a be@@ er .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it . just do it . just take it . &quot;
and my brother started coming at me .
he said , &quot; well , what about you ? now , what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t worry about nu@@ ts too much , because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; om@@ a told all of them that they are very special . &quot;
and then i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
i &apos;m going to stand with you some thing .
i probably don &apos;t want to do that .
this is probably being broad@@ cu@@ ted publi@@ c@@ ly .
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i conf@@ and@@ ed that i &apos;ve never dr@@ ated one drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s vi@@ thetic , and i say this because identity is power .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t believe first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t do .
of course , my grandmother would say to all their grand@@ children , they &apos;re special .
my grand@@ father was in the prison with pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion in prison .
so my un@@ cle died of al@@ co@@ hol &apos;s disease .
and she believed that these were the issues that we needed to care about .
i &apos;ve been trying to tell a little bit about our own justice system .
this country is a different way than 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people were in prison and ja@@ il in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
and the united states today has the highest in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rate in the world .
seven million people are ex@@ clu@@ ding to cur@@ ren@@ cy or condi@@ tional pun@@ ch@@ hi@@ des .
in my opini@@ on , mass dis@@ abilities have changed fundament@@ ally .
in so@@ cially we@@ ak and black parts of the population , des@@ pair and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of these changes .
one out of three of these male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , ex@@ posed to jud@@ gment , or condi@@ tional pun@@ sions .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles on phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men are either either in prison , or in prison , or with condi@@ tional pun@@ sion of the case .
so , our system is not only formed by questions that are de@@ dic@@ ated to de@@ ad@@ li@@ ence , it &apos;s going to be de@@ dic@@ ated by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that makes them much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and gu@@ il@@ ty than poor and
em@@ ph@@ as@@ is , not de@@ bt , affect the result .
and ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , we seem to be satis@@ fied with it .
a politics of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems don &apos;t exist our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
and i think that &apos;s interesting .
and i think there &apos;s a couple of interesting develop@@ ments .
my home state al@@ ab@@ ama redu@@ ces you perman@@ ently the cor@@ ri@@ gation of vot@@ ing when they &apos;re dest@@ in@@ ally con@@ vi@@ cted .
here , in al@@ ab@@ ama today , 3@@ 4 percent of the male black population re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ed their vot@@ ing right .
and we predi@@ cted that in 10 years , the price of repres@@ entation of the ci@@ vi@@ c mind is going to be as t@@ all as the commit@@ ment of vot@@ ing rights .
the sil@@ ence is in@@ fl@@ a@@ tive .
i de@@ dic@@ ated kids .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the 3@@ 0-@@ year-old children con@@ vi@@ cted of the death in prison .
in this country , for children &apos;s li@@ fel@@ ings , it comes from li@@ fel@@ ong re@@ fin@@ ers with no stable pun@@ ish@@ ment .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of proce@@ d@@ ure .
world is the only country in the world .
i de@@ dic@@ ated people in death cells .
now , the question of death pen@@ al@@ ty is an interesting question .
we think that because we &apos;ve taught it so that the true question is : has a human deser@@ ved to die for one of him &apos;s forces ?
it &apos;s a very elegan@@ ome question .
but you can think of it differently depen@@ ding on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : somebody deser@@ ved a crime for a crime , but did we ear@@ n it to kill ?
and i think that &apos;s fascinating .
death pen@@ al@@ ty in america defin@@ es itself with er@@ ror .
on nine people that we &apos;ve ex@@ posed to , we have one that we &apos;ve re@@ tar@@ ded for inno@@ cent , which is de@@ dic@@ ated to the death side of the death .
an amazing er@@ ror , one of the nine inno@@ cent .
and i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we &apos;d never let somebody fly with an airplane , if for nine planes to pick off , off , one down .
but somehow , we can get rid of ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our conc@@ ern .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
it &apos;s not our fight .
so i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question is , do we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m contribu@@ ting to my students &apos; afri@@ can@@ american story . i &apos;m talking about sla@@ very .
i talk about terror@@ ism , the time towards the end of re@@ construction , to the third of world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know very much about that .
but for afri@@ can@@ -@@ american in this country , it was a time of ter@@ ror .
in many places , people have had to be afraid of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs .
or before it were bom@@ bing .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror that shapes her life .
so these older people are coming up to me and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking , for the first time in our nation &apos;s history with terror@@ ism , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terror@@ ism , of course , the ra@@ pping re@@ view and decades of the ra@@ ke@@ ful motiv@@ ated and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d had increas@@ ed and a@@
and yet , in our own country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ces our actions have in histor@@ ical context .
we &apos;re always coming up to each other .
we &apos;re getting new ten@@ sions and conflict and conflict .
and it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think it &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in south africa , people have understood that the ra@@ yers of ra@@ ke doesn &apos;t over@@ come without the will@@ ing@@ ness to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
even after the geno@@ cide in r@@ wand@@ a , there was this offer , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given a couple of talks in germany about death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists , after my talk , came up and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly dist@@ ur@@ bing to hear them like that . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there are no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and of course , in germany , it can never give you more . &quot;
it &apos;s been sil@@ ent . and then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we will ever be talking for the syste@@ matic people to speak of people .
it would be responsible by us , consci@@ ously and tar@@ ge@@ ted people . &quot;
and i thought about it .
what it would feel like , to live in a world where the ger@@ man state was going to place people , especially when there was un@@ propor@@ tion to a lot of je@@ ws .
it would be in@@ suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ently .
it would be in@@ conc@@ ei@@ ved .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states of the ancient south , we &apos;re going to go to people -- here &apos;s the risk of death , 11 times higher , when the vic@@ tim knows , when it &apos;s black , and the vic@@ tim knows -- in the same states where the bodies are vis@@ iting the bodies of people &apos;s lives in the world .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental de@@ for@@ de@@ zation .
now , i think our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
if we don &apos;t touch with it , with these difficult top@@ ics , the posi@@ tives and wonderful things are also affected .
we do love innovation .
we love technology and creativity to work .
and we love entertain@@ ment .
but ultimately , these reali@@ ties are over@@ lin@@ ed by fear , ab@@ use , re@@ medi@@ ation , ex@@ tern@@ ation .
it seems to me that it &apos;s important to uni@@ te both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , commit@@ ment , to be able to be able to get in a complex world .
for me , they &apos;re going to get time to think and talk about those poor people who are imag@@ ined that will never be at ted .
but think , in a way , it &apos;s aug@@ mented in our own lives .
we all need to believe the things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re very rational esti@@ mate , we esti@@ mate it .
innovation , creativity , and development , is not just out of our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by what they believe in our he@@ arts .
it &apos;s this wire of wire that i believe dri@@ ves us , not just being open for all the bright and terri@@ fic things , but also for the dark and proble@@ matic things .
vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ ire , the big ze@@ ze@@ ian politi@@ cian once said .
&quot; when we were fighting in eastern europe for the op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted everything to do , but what we needed most was hope , a mental gui@@ dance that was will@@ ing@@ ful , sometimes to be in hop@@ eless places and wit@@ ness . &quot;
this mental gui@@ sion is the core of what i think the ted communities are strug@@ gling to do for this .
there is no exten@@ sion about technology and design that allows us to be human , unless we have eyes and e@@ ars for poverty , exten@@ sion and in@@ justice and in@@ justice .
i want to war@@ n you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
when i was a young law@@ yer , i was going to meet the great privi@@ lege of meeting ro@@ ink par@@ ks
the wife of par@@ ks kept back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ y , where she &apos;d been carrying two of her ol@@ dest friends , who had organi@@ zed the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ y bus bo@@ y@@ k@@ ot@@ t -- and virg@@ ini@@ a dur@@ r , a white girl , cli@@ ff@@ ord dur@@ r , dr. king for@@ at .
so these women were just gather@@ ing , and they were just under@@ going .
so occasi@@ on@@ ally , grand@@ car@@ r called me up and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , wife &apos;s par@@ ks comes to the city . we want to talk .
would you like to come to it and hear ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , so much . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and listen@@ ed to just coming .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so was so in@@ spir@@ ing .
and i was sitting there one day and i was listening to this women , and after a few hours , wife had turned to me and said , &quot; now br@@ y@@ an , tell me what that was rather , to me , which is the same initiative for the same thing
what &apos;s going to try to get you ? &quot;
i began to talk to my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against in@@ justice . &quot;
now , w@@ r wants to help people who have been inno@@ ci@@ stable .
we want to fight bi@@ ased numbers and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al justice system .
we want li@@ fel@@ ly dea@@ f sent@@ ences without re@@ duc@@ ing a const@@ ant pun@@ ch@@ line for children .
we want something against the death pen@@ al@@ ty company .
we want to lower the number of pris@@ on@@ ers &apos; number .
we want to break up mass appli@@ cations . &quot;
and i was looking at my usual talk , and after@@ ward she looked at me and said , &quot; m@@ um . ho@@ um . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make it very , really ti@@ red . &quot;
then , white car@@ r re@@ turned to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very ta@@ ck@@ er . &quot;
and so that &apos;s why i think the ted community is going to be pit@@ le .
we need to find ways to give us these challenges : this problem , that ti@@ p@@ iness .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds on all of our humanity .
in my work , i learned a very simple things .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
when you lie , it &apos;s not just a li@@ ar .
when people take something that doesn &apos;t just hear it , it &apos;s not just a hin@@ t .
even who kill@@ s somebody who &apos;s dying , it &apos;s not just a kil@@ ler .
and because that &apos;s so , there &apos;s a basic human dig@@ ni@@ ty that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
i think , in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that although it &apos;s so dra@@ matic , so beautiful and in@@ spir@@ ing , we don &apos;t really end up being measu@@ red with our technology , not the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intelle@@ ct and minds .
eventually , a society is not measu@@ red by how they treat their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but as they deal with the poor , the re@@ com@@ men@@ ded , the enti@@ tor@@ ing ones .
because in this context , we &apos;re starting to gras@@ p the truly amazing things that make us out .
sometimes i get that balance . it &apos;s a story to end .
sometimes i &apos;m pus@@ hing too much .
i &apos;m going to be ti@@ red of the way we all do .
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our belie@@ fs , in a very important way .
i &apos;ve been de@@ dic@@ ated to these kids who have been con@@ vi@@ cted to very hard sent@@ ences .
i go to the front prison and vis@@ iting a cli@@ ent who may be 13 or 14 years old , and who should be an adult from the cour@@ ts .
then i ask myself : how could this happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn someone into something that it isn &apos;t ?
jud@@ ges seems to look at him as a adults , but i see a child .
and one night , i sta@@ yed up for too long and i thought , well , my god , if you can turn a ju@@ dge into something else , then there must be magic forces .
right , br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has magic power@@ s .
you don &apos;t want to ask you what .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think , i began to work on a fight .
i had a 14 year-old , poor black boy volunte@@ er than i was under@@ active .
and i started with this interview , and the sum@@ mit said , &quot; t@@ ack to my poor , 14 year-old great mand@@ ants like a privi@@ le@@ ged , white , 7@@ 5@@ -@@ year-old top mana@@ gers . &quot;
in my interview interview , i expla@@ ined that fail@@ ures of the state transp@@ l@@ ant and police were as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of con@@ tradi@@ cting failure .
there was a crazy line about that that in this country , nothing more relevant in this country is that there &apos;s no mis@@ ability .
the next morning , i wo@@ ke up , and no longer knew if i had just dre@@ am@@ t this crazy at@@ t@@ ler or actually written it .
and for me , i didn &apos;t just write him , but i sent him to the court .
a few months ago , and i had just for@@ gotten about it .
and finally , i decided , well , my god , i &apos;m going to do it in the cour@@ ts and this crazy case .
i ste@@ pped into the car , and i was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with a little bit .
so i dro@@ ve to the court .
and i thought it &apos;s so hard , it &apos;s so pain@@ ful .
finally , i went out of my car and went up the sta@@ irs for a court .
when i got the sta@@ ir@@ case to the cour@@ k , there was an el@@ der@@ ly , black man , the home of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds .
and then when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
then he was wh@@ is@@ sing me at the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was strength for me .
it tou@@ ched something deeply deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribu@@ te every single thing to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i enter@@ ed the cour@@ thou@@ se .
as soon as the ju@@ dge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you meet this crazy ad@@ ju@@ st@@ ment ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started to argue .
and more and more people would come in , simply because they were an@@ gry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and off@@ ic@@ ered citi@@ yers and off@@ ic@@ ers &apos; staf@@ f .
fli@@ pping in the body was full of people who were an@@ gry , that we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality .
from my sight , i looked up and down the house of the house .
he kept looking through the window and was able to hear all the to@@ hu@@ w@@ las@@ h@@ u again .
and he went up and down .
finally , this older black man came to a very smart face in the court room and just put right in front of me , almost on the defen@@ se bank .
10 minutes later , the ju@@ dge was listening to a pause .
during the break , a police off@@ ic@@ er came in and made it so that the home of the school was in the cour@@ thou@@ se .
this de@@ pu@@ ty was running over to the older layer .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what do you do in the cour@@ thou@@ se ? &quot;
and the older black man stood up , and he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say to this young man , don &apos;t leave it from my eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
so , i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pen@@ ality of the universe is going to ex@@ ca@@ v@@ ate much , but that it &apos;s dec@@ lin@@ ing the justice .
that we are not completely evol@@ ved as humans unless we care about human rights and jud@@ g@@ ments .
that our entire survival is lin@@ ked to every single person &apos;s survival .
that we have to connect our visi@@ ons of technology and design , from entertain@@ ment and creativity with humanity , p@@ ity and justice .
and most of all , i &apos;d like to see those of you who are simil@@ arly , just saying : don &apos;t lose this goal . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen this audience , this community , a very obvious wish , and it &apos;s listening to help you and do something .
so what else can we do ?
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are ways all around the world .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a secon@@ d-@@ guess of people in this spring , where it &apos;s really about trying to imple@@ ment something from that money that &apos;s going to flow otherwise into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
here , for example , in california , for example , in the next five years , you &apos;re getting a billion dollars for the death pen@@ al@@ ty . a billion dollars .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all car@@ di@@ a@@ c re@@ ven@@ u@@ es end up not with a re@@ co@@ very .
5@@ 6 percent of all ra@@ tions of ra@@ pe de@@ pri@@ vation doesn &apos;t come in .
there &apos;s a chance to do something here .
and so this will pro@@ pose to be able to invest the money in more sec@@ es@@ hi@@ des and security .
well , i think there are possibilities everywhere .
during the past three decades , the crime of crime has dec@@ lin@@ ed enor@@ m@@ ously .
and this is a matter of fact that &apos;s going to be put in a context with increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation numbers .
what would you say to someone who belie@@ ves this ?
now , in fact , the number of non@@ violent cri@@ mes has not been very changed .
most of the mass dis@@ char@@ ts in this country didn &apos;t really find in the classroom of violent crime .
it was the mis@@ gui@@ ded c@@ and@@ er against drugs .
and so these are the dra@@ matic numbers of the pris@@ on@@ ers coming in .
we te@@ am@@ ed away from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
now , we &apos;ve got three degrees of names , and people can get people behind them forever , for a bi@@ ke lar@@ ft , for the the@@ ft of good stuff , rather than that you force them to give back to the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce
i think we need to do more to help people , who have become the sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce of a mis@@ er@@ able , not less .
and i think our science as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment is not helping anybody to do it .
i think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to change .
now , br@@ y@@ an , they actually brought up a string here .
they are an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
thank you for coming to ted . thank you very much .

crisis . death . disaster .
oh , my god .
so this is just a few of the cli@@ ps that i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , but it may have been the last six years .
the fact is that the media pre@@ fer to show us negative issues because our minds are just paying attention to this top@@ ic .
and there &apos;s also a really good reason for this .
every second every day , our senses will actually start to process much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important to us than our survival , the first place for all the information for all that information is to be part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be , the am@@ y@@
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning system , our des@@ per@@ ing dete@@ ctor .
it took the entire information to look through , looking for any idea of dan@@ ger in our environment .
so if we look at the news , we pre@@ fer to look for a long-term no@@ d@@ der .
and the old saying , &quot; if it &apos;s b@@ loo@@ d@@ ling , &quot; is very true . &quot;
now , with all of our digital devices that we have seven days a week , 24 hours a day doing all these negative news , it &apos;s no mira@@ cle that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
no wonder that everybody thinks the world is always worse than that .
but possibly , that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century through a series of forces that we &apos;ve made in the past century , that it will be possible for us to create a world of sur@@ v@@ ei@@ pt in the next three decades .
now , i &apos;m not suggest@@ ing that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , poverty , water -- and we &apos;ve got energy and energy -- we &apos;ve already got it .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but eventually they end up over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
so , let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved in the last century , so that we can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the development .
over the past hundred years , average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has more than dou@@ bled , which has tri@@ pl@@ ed against the average income of the world &apos;s population has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
we have child mortality a tent@@ h of child mortality .
and what comes out is that the diet , electricity , transpor@@ tation costs , has been re@@ duced by multi@@ tude and communication costs .
and steve pin@@ ker showed us that we are now living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history .
and according to charles ken@@ ny , the liter@@ acy rate has gone from 25 percent to 80 percent in the past 1@@ 30 years .
we &apos;re living in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget this .
and we increase our expec@@ tations continue to continue constantly .
in fact , we have re@@ defined poverty .
consider that a great propor@@ tion of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ations , television phones , climate change and cars .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists of the last century , the im@@ per@@ ators of the earth , could never have been able to dream such lux@@ ury goods .
the basis of a lot of this is using technologies , and these are increasing ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly .
well , my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown us that any tool that will become information technology , on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law jum@@ ps , and the price performance stor@@ m is dou@@ bling every 12 to 24 months .
that costs cell phone in your po@@ cket about a million times less , and it &apos;s thousands of times faster than a super@@ computer from the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
now , take a look at this cur@@ ve .
this is mil@@ ore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
and notice two things about this cur@@ ve .
first , how ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely it -- in good ways , war or peace , rec@@ ession , depression , rec@@ ession , depression and mas@@ ses of inter@@ jun@@ ts .
and this is the result of faster computers building the faster computers .
it slo@@ ws down for nei@@ ther of our big problems .
and also , despite their log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic force on the left side , it &apos;s up@@ ward .
so the rate of growth is spee@@ ding up .
and on this cur@@ ve , on the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a range of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of us
&quot; cloud design , &quot; something that my friends in auto@@ des@@ k call , &quot; the sensor@@ s and networks , &quot; robots , 3d prin@@ ter that can allow the personal production to democra@@ ti@@ ze personal production on our planet , syn@@ thetic biology , nan@@ o-@@ materials and artificial intelligence , nan@@ o-@@ materials and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the vic@@ tory of ib@@ m super@@ computer wat@@ son in &quot; risk ? &quot;
it was ab@@ und@@ ant .
i used to sho@@ ot the new@@ spa@@ pers and looked for the best head@@ lines i could find .
i love this one : &quot; wat@@ son de@@ fe@@ at human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s all about understanding the nu@@ an@@ ces of language .
i want you to imagine that this artificial intelligence of any cell phone is available to each of the mobile phones .
four years ago , ray kurz@@ weil happened , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university called sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
we bring these students all together , with particular focus on how they can be used to solve the big challenges facing humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create the tools , to create products , products and services , within a decade , the life of the mil@@ tens of people affected together .
think about the fact that a group of students can influence the lives of billions of people today .
thir@@ ty years ago , this was ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
today we can con@@ form to do@@ zens of companies that have done that .
if i think about creating sur@@ plus , i don &apos;t mean a life full of lux@@ ury on everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about making good flow from some meas@@ ures .
sc@@ ar@@ city is actually const@@ it@@ u@@ tional , and technology is a liber@@ al force .
now , here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ i@@ i@@ c , in the middle of the 18@@ th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he &apos;s invited the king of si@@ am to dinner .
na@@ po@@ le@@ ons soldiers got sil@@ ver be@@ ste@@ ck , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself got gold pun@@ ch@@ h@@ giving .
the king of si@@ am , however , became al@@ umin@@ um bri@@ ste@@ ck .
al@@ umin@@ um has been the most valuable metal on the planet at that time , more valuable than gold and plat@@ in@@ al .
so this is why the dom@@ e of the bear mon@@ um@@ ent has been made out of al@@ umin@@ um .
and although al@@ umin@@ um takes 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the mass of soil , it turns out that it &apos;s not as p@@ ure .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and si@@ sting .
but then became the technology of electro@@ ly@@ sis and made al@@ umin@@ um forma@@ tion so cheap that we use it to connect with our dis@@ pos@@ able mental agen@@ cy .
and then , let &apos;s put this analog@@ y into the future .
we &apos;re thinking about energy sc@@ ar@@ city today .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet where we use 5@@ 0,000 times more energy than we use every year .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of energy cr@@ as@@ hed every 8@@ 8 minutes to the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about sc@@ ar@@ city , it &apos;s the problem that is acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and good news is good news .
in this year , it was the first time to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the same same electricity -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
the cost of solar energy , last year , took about 50 percent .
so last month , this came up with a study that shows that , up to the end of this decade , in the sun of solar power , six cents per k@@ w@@ h , compared to 15 cents in the national average , compared to 15 cents in the
and if we have an energy over@@ la@@ p , we also will have water in the ab@@ und@@ ance .
now let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember car@@ l sa@@ gan &apos;s vo@@ y@@ a@@ tis production vehicle in 199@@ 0 , when he moved on saturn , went back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . what was it supposed to be ?
&quot; a p@@ ale blue do@@ t . &quot;
it &apos;s because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent sal@@ a@@ water , two percent are e@@ aten , and we &apos;re fighting 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope as well .
and there &apos;s new technology , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ologi@@ es on the way , nan@@ o-@@ materials .
and from talking to this morning , with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the inno@@ v@@ ators of the do it , i want to share with you a little bit -- he gave me the per@@ mission -- his technology , which means &quot; sl@@ ing@@ ling , &quot; and many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation in the winter camp .
it can create a thousand li@@ ters of safe drin@@ king water a day from different sources -- whether sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , lat@@ r@@ ine -- and all that for less than two cents per li@@ ter .
the head of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just agre@@ ed to laun@@ ch a very large test project with a hundred un@@ its in the developing world .
and if everything is going well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a is going to apply this technology glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries on the whole planet .
this is a technology suppor@@ ted innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
oh my goo@@ dness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent redu@@ ction rate of mobile phones in developing countries up to the end of 20@@ 13 .
just think that a ma@@ sa@@ i@@ c war@@ ri@@ al with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president re@@ ag@@ an was 25 years ago .
and if you search with your smar@@ t@@ phone on google , you &apos;ve got more access to knowledge and information as president clin@@ ton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communic@@ ations in the world , which no one could ever have predi@@ cted .
and it gets better , the things that you and i spend spend tens of thousands of dollars -- gps , h@@ d video and photographs , libr@@ aries full of books and music , technology , medical diagno@@ stics -- now are literally de@@ materi@@ ali@@ zing and che@@ aper in your cell phone .
and best of all , it may be what &apos;s expected for us in health .
i had a pleasure last month with the source of qu@@ al@@ i foundation to announ@@ ce the so-@@ called &quot; the $ 10 million qu@@ al@@ com@@ m tri@@ cor@@ der &quot; tri@@ cor@@ der prize . &quot;
we challenge teams around the world to connect to all these technologies in a mobile phone like this , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equi@@ pped with crow@@ ds , you can test flu@@ cab@@ es or your blood values .
and to win , the device has to diagno@@ se a better diagno@@ sis than a team of highly sk@@ ill@@ ed physi@@ cians .
imagine this device , in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease of disease , and 1.@@ 3 percent of the staf@@ f of public health .
when this device is sequen@@ ced an r@@ na@@ o or a dna virus , which is not known , it turns out to be a pan@@ de@@ mic and pre@@ v@@ ents a pan@@ de@@ mic out of the out@@ break .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to take us into a world of sur@@ plus .
and i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines represent the population .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed 7@@ -@@ billion bil@@ ls .
and only by the way , the greatest in@@ sur@@ ance against population is a better education and nutri@@ tion in the world .
by 2010 , we &apos;ve just connected one another under two billion people online .
by 20@@ 20 , we &apos;re going to move forward from two billion internet users .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard of before are going to inclu@@ de the global communic@@ ations .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to pra@@ y ?
and instead of industrial gri@@ di@@ lock , i see one of the biggest economic sp@@ her@@ es of the story .
and these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become heal@@ thi@@ er by using the tri@@ co@@ der &apos;s heal@@ thi@@ er , and they &apos;re getting better through the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by using the possibility of using 3d pr@@ inter@@ s , and so much more productive , and than at any point it &apos;s going to be so much more productive than
so what can three billion growing , healthy , collective members of the human community ?
how about a phr@@ ase new never ever agre@@ ed before .
how about the op@@ pres@@ sion of whatever you are to be a voice to make care of you and make change , for the first time , for the first time
what are these three billion people going to bring us together ?
so , how about inter@@ plac@@ ers that we don &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i &apos;ve learned through x in x is that small teams that are motiv@@ ated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that can only be able to create big corpo@@ ra@@ tions and governments in the past .
so , i want to close with a story that really exc@@ ites me .
there &apos;s a program that may be familiar with a couple of you .
it &apos;s a game called fol@@ dit .
it was developed at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to study how the protein is going to be growing .
so , depen@@ ding on his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in public science .
so far , this was a problem for super@@ computers .
and this is a game that was played by university profess@@ ors and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the play online hundreds of thousands .
and it showed that today the human pattern recogni@@ tion is more likely to fold the proteins together than the best super@@ computers .
and when these people came and saw who was the best growth fol@@ der in the world , it was a mit professor , it was somebody from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who worked for days as the ce@@ tain in a re@@ ar clin@@ ic , and at night the best protein or@@ ma@@ zer was in the world .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what interests me enormous trust in our future is the fact that today we have more power today to ask us the big challenges of our planet .
we &apos;re sensitive to an exponenti@@ al technology with exponenti@@ al technology .
we have a passion of a di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
we &apos;ve got the capital of tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
and we &apos;ve got three billion new minds that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
and we &apos;ll expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you very much .
and i think we need to fir@@ m something against a transforma@@ tive piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s starting to become a medical therapy , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m in my business for a long time than i can allow myself to give up a piece of my own fal@@ o pre@@ test to do this .
but before i get my talk to the subject of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball
hey , why don &apos;t you ?
we are near the seas@@ on and we &apos;re head@@ ing up to the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
we all love baseball , isn &apos;t we ?
and baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; seems soon and is about statistics , and to use them , to use a great poster team .
i &apos;m going to be obs@@ essed with a stati@@ stic that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the average achie@@ vement of the bat .
we talk about a 300 when a be@@ ard is killed 300 .
that means that the player is sa@@ f@@ ely pit@@ ched three out of 10 stro@@ kes .
this is what the ball says , the ball , he gets on , he won &apos;t catch , and who tried to throw the ball to the first place , didn &apos;t do it in time , and the run@@ ner was in security .
three out of the 10 .
do you know how to call a 3@@ ,@@ 00@@ ter in general lea@@ gue baseball ?
all right , really , really good , maybe a single star .
do you know how to call a 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ ter ?
that &apos;s somebody at the edge , probably a four thousand hits .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y -- as ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ ak@@ r -- the last style lea@@ gue baseball player who ran over 400 times in the sky .
so let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable , or maybe a little less , i think i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
suppose you &apos;ve got a blind co@@ verage , and you &apos;re going to survive to a oper@@ at@@ eu@@ r , whose average state of growth is in terms of blin@@ dness .
it doesn &apos;t , in some way , work , right ?
suppose you &apos;re going to live in a certain remote area , and you have a loved people with re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ating heart disease and your home de@@ pos@@ its to a car@@ di@@ ologist whose average performance is at 200 is 200 .
but , you know , guess what ?
she &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on top of the ris@@ ing measure .
and it s@@ lam@@ es for a 25@@ 7 .
in some way , it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think about the average creation of a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , who should be a res@@ cu@@ e , a res@@ cu@@ e assi@@ stant ?
thousand , a very good way .
the truth is that nobody in the entire medicine knows what a good surge@@ on or a doctor or a res@@ cu@@ e will be .
what we &apos;re doing though is that we inclu@@ de each of them , including , to be able to get out into the world with the pro@@ cla@@ sti@@ on .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s worried about the details of how this is supposed to be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
i was an obs@@ essi@@ ve obs@@ essi@@ ve student .
in high school , a fellow student once said that brian gold@@ mann would learn for a blood test .
and it certainly was .
and i learned in my little little home class in the nur@@ ses at the tor@@ am general hospital , not far from here .
i learned everything that was memor@@ i@@ zed
in my an@@ atom@@ ic lec@@ ture , i learned the orig@@ ins and stre@@ t@@ ched every muscle every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery that lead away from the a@@ or@@ ta , liber@@ al and ordinary differ@@ enti@@ al practic@@ es .
they even knew all the differences diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy ren@@ ale tu@@ bu@@ tra@@ re a@@ ten@@ do@@ sis .
and i colle@@ cted the whole time more and more knowledge .
and i was good , and i was han@@ ging out by c@@ um &apos;s lou@@ der@@ y .
and i left the medical school with the impres@@ sion that i knew , if i knew everything , or anything as much as possible , as close as possible , that i could be imm@@ une to what was wrong to do .
and it worked for a while until i met a woman &apos;s prin@@ ter .
i was em@@ bed@@ ded here by a harvard hospital here in tor@@ onto here in tor@@ onto to me to the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital .
at this time , i was sig@@ ning the car@@ di@@ ology layer in the car@@ di@@ ology service .
and it was my as@@ sign@@ ment when the emergen@@ cy of reading car@@ di@@ ology transp@@ l@@ ant investi@@ g@@ ated the emergen@@ cy patient patient .
and i &apos;ll give feedback to my top doctor .
i studied a woman prin@@ ter , and she was in brea@@ th@@ -@@ specific ways .
and when i listen@@ ed to her , she made some cl@@ inging sound .
and when i was on the ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i was able to hear a cra@@ w@@ ling sound on both sides , which told me that they suff@@ ered from con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on heart failure .
this is a condition where the heart is dec@@ lin@@ ing , instead of pump@@ ing all of the blood , putting some por@@ tion of the flo@@ wer in the lung , and then you get it gradu@@ ally , and that &apos;s where the shor@@ ta@@ ti@@ ge came .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagno@@ sis to any ex@@ ception .
i put it and made me care of the treatment .
i put their as@@ pi@@ re in . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave them their medicine that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ es , water tab@@ lets , so that they boun@@ ce the flu@@ id .
and over a year and a half , they began to feel better and a half .
i felt really good about it .
and i made my first mistake , and i sent it home .
actually , i made two er@@ r@@ ors .
i would send her home without talking to my mor@@ t@@ le@@ ent@@ ry .
i didn &apos;t take up the pa@@ pers and did what i had to call , which had been a call in my head , so that he had an opportunity to have a own image .
and he knew that he would be able to contribu@@ te addi@@ tional information to her .
maybe i did it with a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a volunte@@ er doctor .
maybe i wanted to take so successful and so able to take their responsibility that i was like that , and so i would be able to ask for my patients without having to contact him .
my second mistake was a bad mistake .
which means that i sent her home , i mis@@ sed a quie@@ t voice in me trying to say to me , &quot; gold man , no good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , it was so much un@@ fortun@@ ate to me that i asked the nur@@ se who was thinking about m@@ .@@ t@@ . anima@@ tes , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when she &apos;s going home ? &quot;
and the nur@@ se was thinking about it and said in a counter@@ -@@ time way , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember as if it was yesterday .
so i sig@@ ned the des@@ ser@@ ge and a tre@@ at@@ shop and a res@@ cu@@ e and a res@@ cu@@ e , and they dro@@ pped them home .
and i decided to go back to work .
the rest of the day , the night , i had this na@@ sty feeling in my sto@@ mach .
but i kept working on it .
and at the end of the day , i grab@@ bed my things , d@@ ressed the hospital and went to the park , to go home with the car , when i was doing something that i didn &apos;t make .
i went home in the emergen@@ cy department of the emergen@@ cy department .
and there &apos;s another nur@@ se there , not the sister that looked for a woman &apos;s prin@@ ter , but another three words to me , and those three words are most afraid of the most emergen@@ cy rule i know .
other designers are afraid of these , but the emergen@@ cy environment is particularly , because we only see the patient so fle@@ di@@ ge@@ di@@ zed .
the three words are : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient that you sen@@ ded home ? &quot;
asked the nur@@ se ev@@ al@@ u@@ ative .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular c@@ art .
so , she was ki@@ cking away .
she &apos;d be back and die .
about an hour after she got at home after i &apos;d been sending her home , she collap@@ sed her and the family called 9@@ 11 . the res@@ cu@@ e of the eye , they brought back to the emergen@@ cy station with a blood level of 50 , which is a dangerous sho@@ ck .
she was bar@@ ely brea@@ thing , and there was going to be the lights .
emergen@@ cy clas@@ ses used to slow all the str@@ ands .
they gave up their blood pressure el@@ ev@@ ated .
they stit@@ ched her up to the front machine .
i &apos;ve been sho@@ cked , and i &apos;ve been cr@@ us@@ hed .
and i survi@@ ved this song , because after the stabili@@ le , she came through the inten@@ sive care center , and i hop@@ ed that they were going to re@@ cover .
and after two , three days , they realized that she never was going to wa@@ w@@ ant .
she had not suff@@ ered an tre@@ at@@ able brain .
her family had gather@@ ed .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they launched the inci@@ dent .
on day the day , they li@@ ok -- m@@ s. prin@@ ter , a woman , a mom and an grandmother .
they say that you never forget the names that the dea@@ ths never forget .
and that was the first time that i discovered this myself .
so the next couple of weeks , i made myself sugge@@ sti@@ on , and i first found myself the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isol@@ ated , not the kind of healthy sh@@ ame you felt because you couldn &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy sh@@ ame when you give the secret of the best friend , even though that one on the end , when you end up with bad science , and you swe@@ ar the best friend you can never make a bad sense of mistake , and you b@@ low out that you &apos;re never going to make a mistake like that .
you know , when you get to temp@@ t and never do the mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of text@@ ri@@ gi@@ ous sh@@ ame .
the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you fir@@ m in the middle of the world .
it &apos;s the one who is telling you not what it &apos;s doing is bad , but that &apos;s not what you made yourself .
and that &apos;s what seemed to me .
and it wasn &apos;t based on my high school level . it was very gent@@ le .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was mess@@ ing down and sur@@ ely meant that i wasn &apos;t going to be su@@ t@@ led .
but i kept on thinking about these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the head of the head ? why did i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , i think , how could i make a du@@ m@@ b mistake ?
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly , it certainly made it sec@@ ure .
and i started feeling better .
and then on a ni@@ w@@ ber@@ ed day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds and the sun broke down , and i said maybe i could feel better again .
and i was talking to myself that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ ction and never again commit@@ ted a mistake that the voice could smell .
and she did it .
and i kept working on it .
and then , it happened again .
two years later , i had diabetes at the emergen@@ cy hospital in a commun@@ al hospital of tor@@ onto , and i ended up with a 25@@ -year-old man with ble@@ ating sc@@ ra@@ p .
it was a lot going on and i was in a hur@@ ry .
he &apos;d always seen it here .
i looked in the wheel@@ s , and it was a little little bit of p@@ ink .
and i gave him a scre@@ am for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin and sent him to stop .
and even when he walked out of the door , he poin@@ ted up on his ra@@ ke .
two days later , i came to my second in@@ ju@@ ries race , and my che@@ pp@@ er had told me a conversation in her office .
and she said three words : remember , do you remember ?
&quot; do you mind the patient with the ban@@ king jo@@ int ? &quot;
it turns out that it &apos;s a stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ mic infe@@ ction .
he had a poten@@ tially living disease known known for epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
they can google , but it &apos;s not an infe@@ ction of the ra@@ il , but the upp@@ er way of eng@@ aging and causes the breath of brea@@ thing .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got in@@ tra@@ c@@ tors anti@@ bo@@ tic@@ a and re@@ her@@ ited a few days later .
and i went back through the same tor@@ ture of sh@@ ame and self-@@ dou@@ b@@ ts , and i felt bu@@ ried and dro@@ pped and dro@@ pped to the work until again and over and over and over again .
in a stop@@ th of emergen@@ cy , i &apos;ve over@@ seen two times a blind co@@ ordin@@ ation .
there &apos;s some kind of thing that , especially when you think about it , you &apos;re working in a hospital that only had 14 patients a night at that time .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and they also didn &apos;t have any gu@@ is@@ es in their treatment .
i thought that he would have kid@@ ney ro@@ cks .
i condu@@ cted the no@@ ray of the kid@@ ney , and when i was in trouble , my collea@@ gue introduced the re@@ ception of the patient to rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence the patient in the lower ri@@ ght-@@ hand sector and called the oper@@ ators .
the other one had a strong di@@ arr@@ he@@ um .
i condu@@ cted flu@@ i@@ id to re@@ hy@@ che@@ ze him and asked my colleagues as well to gu@@ ard him .
and this is what he did , and when he reach@@ ed a re@@ lie@@ vation at the bottom of the bottom , he called the oper@@ ator .
in both cases surgery , oper@@ ated , and they were fine .
both of the scri@@ p@@ ts of mine were po@@ gling me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake were only happening in the first five years , which a lot of my colleagues say , but it &apos;s a total co@@ bu@@ dation .
some of my blocks happened in the last five years .
it &apos;s alone , prote@@ cted and encoura@@ ging without aid
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can &apos;t actually find the sil@@ ent voice that &apos;s going to happen to me , how can i actually share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t com@@ mit the same ?
if i &apos;m in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when was the last time you heard about somebody who had mis@@ er@@ ments about er@@ ror about mis@@ er@@ ence ?
oh yes , you go to a cock@@ tail party , and you like you like any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i took a room full of colleagues with friends and to tell them what i was telling you , i would not really get the end of the second story before someone really we@@ ars to catch a jo@@ ke , someone would change a jo@@ ke , they would pass the rest and for@@ gotten the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that an or@@ th@@ op@@ ologist in my hospital would have taken out the wrong leg , trust me , i would have trouble to look at it in my eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally den@@ ial of er@@ ror .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic posi@@ tions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who are con@@ stra@@ ined , those who are con@@ stra@@ ined , those who con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts sleep sc@@ or@@ es and under@@ stands with good results that are good results .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological response as an anti@@ bodies that attack a human being .
and there is the idea that if we can make people who are er@@ r@@ ors from medi@@ an@@ e@@ ous , that a safe system rema@@ ins .
but there are two problems with this .
in my 20@@ s for about 20 years of medical science and journ@@ alism , i created a personal medical study on medical er@@ ror and fal@@ se treat@@ ments to do so possible for one of my first article that i &apos;m going to do for the tor@@ onto star at my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black type . &quot;
and what i learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent .
we &apos;re working in a system where we &apos;re going to make mistakes every single day where a decade is either a fal@@ se or fal@@ se do@@ p , where hospitals are either getting more and more expensive , in which hospitals are going to get and de@@ va@@ station and de@@ va@@ station and cause dead .
there are about 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans in this state dying in const@@ it@@ ution er@@ r@@ ors .
in the united states institute , the institute of medicine is the number of medicine in 100,000 .
both of them are hea@@ v@@ ens , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as pre@@ cis@@ ely as we should .
and the cru@@ x is the cru@@ x .
in a hospital system that medicine is dou@@ bling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up with each other .
sleep de@@ pri@@ vation is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have an cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect disease for a patient with a ch@@ est pain .
and then i take the same patient with breast he@@ arts , making it swe@@ pt and gra@@ de and give it a slightly al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic breath , and all of a sudden , the story is comp@@ en@@ sing with com@@ mu@@ tion .
i don &apos;t take the same com@@ pla@@ int .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things in the same way .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptom@@ s in the same way .
all of these cor@@ respon@@ ds to in@@ sur@@ ance is inevi@@ table .
so , if you take the system in the way that i teach it , and all of the un@@ fortun@@ ate health experiences , there &apos;s no one left at the end , there &apos;s no one left .
and you know the conduc@@ tor about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show &quot; white co@@ at , black sk@@ . . &quot; i would say to anyone from the res@@ cu@@ e of the car@@ di@@ ologist , saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; what about her ? &quot; and then i show him the micro@@ phone .
and then their pu@@ p@@ ils exp@@ ands , they &apos;ve turned in front of their head , and then look hard and they can start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want their stories to share them .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistakes that i &apos;m sta@@ ying . &quot;
what you need is a environment which you put in the situation that you &apos;re capable of
what it &apos;s needed is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physi@@ cian .
the re@@ defined wisdom is a human being , knows about his humanity , accep@@ ted it isn &apos;t proud to make mistakes , but everything from it is learning about you , so that it can be passed on .
and they share their experiences with others .
it suppor@@ ts when others are talking about their mistakes .
and they dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate other of their mistakes , not to ex@@ clu@@ de , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way that all of them benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recogni@@ zes people fill the system with life , and when it &apos;s so , people also make mistakes at the time .
so , the system develop@@ ers to make po@@ pp@@ y , which makes it easier to make mistakes inevi@@ table , to actually create things that require the potential that possibly make people inevi@@ table and even get re@@ war@@ ded , and that &apos;s available for people like me , who are going to make the mistakes and make it for the gra@@ des of this reward .
my name is brian gold@@ man .
i am the new defin@@ ed physi@@ cian .
i am a human . i make mistakes .
i re@@ gre@@ t , but i &apos;m trying to learn the hard thing to do in order to pass it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember , i remember .
so , i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s all about transforma@@ tive posi@@ tives .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories before to use the time .
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
you know , he was there in 18@@ 35 .
you might think that he &apos;s a fin@@ ing , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he gather@@ ed fish .
he described one of them as a very common thing .
it was a pu@@ de dis@@ pu@@ te .
up until the &apos; 8@@ 0s , he was fis@@ hed in a very big style .
and now he &apos;s en@@ danger@@ ed species in the ri@@ ght-@@ hand list .
now we &apos;ve heard this story many times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands , or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
still , we &apos;re still going to get to the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands .
we still think that it &apos;s origin@@ ally .
they &apos;re still described as un@@ tou@@ ched as im@@ tou@@ si@@ bles .
so , what has happened here ?
the second story is that it &apos;s a different concept , the transforma@@ tional fe@@ atures of it .
because i experienced a la@@ d@@ der in west africa when i studied a la@@ g@@ ger in west africa .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could make myself integr@@ ated .
and i got a terrible sun@@ fire , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t going to go from there .
it was my first sun@@ bur@@ den .
notice , as you can see , the sli@@ ck of pal@@ ms and a few man@@ gro@@ ves was hal@@ f@@ way around .
there were sp@@ inn@@ ts of about 20 in@@ ches , the ball@@ k@@ ist , the ball@@ l@@ ars , one sub@@ way of the bom@@ p@@ pet .
the fis@@ hes of these bun@@ z@@ age were very activ@@ ated , and the fis@@ her@@ men were getting well well and made a very average job in ghana .
and when i came back to that 27 years later , the fish had s@@ hr@@ un@@ k half of its size .
they grow up five in@@ ches .
and they had been gene@@ tically placed .
it &apos;s still been fish .
the people were still happy .
and the fish also got the fortun@@ e to be there .
so , it hasn &apos;t changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my partici@@ pants in the ab@@ us@@ l net fis@@ her@@ y in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- rather in the early &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe fund@@ ed a lot of the things that have been happening .
fishing pro@@ mot@@ ing countries that have already 100,000 fish of this sort of ug@@ ly ship called mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 is called mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
and i went to mit , and we made re@@ turns throughout the south south chinese ocean and in particular in the ja@@ vas@@ e@@ e .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we came up with .
i know now , it was the reason of the ocean .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of our fir@@ ces were spon@@ ges , and other animals are connected to the cause .
most of the fish , the small dots there , on the gri@@ ck@@ ers , they were coral re@@ ef@@ s fish .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came to de@@ ck , and then it was thro@@ wn back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is going very fast .
within a year , you &apos;re going to run an extra@@ ctive fishing and then start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is going to be changed . it &apos;s in this case -- a hard cause or white cor@@ s becomes na@@ sty ch@@ ist .
so this is a dead tor@@ tor@@ ate .
they weren &apos;t e@@ aten , they thre@@ w them away because they were dead .
once again , we started a vi@@ sti@@ zing .
it wasn &apos;t dro@@ w@@ ning yet .
and then they wanted to kill them , because they were able to eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of har@@ ssi@@ ers acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ated every single time of fis@@ her@@ s when they &apos;re in places where they &apos;ve never been stol@@ en before .
but it &apos;s not going to be docum@@ ented .
we are changing the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we ad@@ just our ou@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of the new level , and we don &apos;t respond to remin@@ der what was there .
you multi@@ pli@@ te it , this is what happens .
so on the y-@@ axis , there are some good things : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , green of their land , the water supply .
over time it &apos;s changing . it changes because , for people , their actions are , of course .
every generation is looking at the pictures that they take in the beginning of their conscious lives as standard , and will be der@@ i@@ ved everything from that .
the difference then is percei@@ ved to be a loss .
but you don &apos;t even take the previous los@@ ses to that .
it can be a sequence of changes .
and in the end , they just want to get the world &apos;s most aff@@ ord@@ able rema@@ ins .
and that &apos;s what our goal lar@@ ni@@ ci@@ vely is .
we want to preser@@ ve things that are disappe@@ ared or things that are not as far as they are .
now , you might think that the problem was people who certainly lived when they lived in predat@@ or societies , and animals killed , and they &apos;ve only been aware of a few generations that they had done .
because obviously an animal is going to r@@ ar@@ ely r@@ ar@@ ely in@@ tend before it dies .
so you don &apos;t lose a frequ@@ ent ear@@ ning animals .
you &apos;re always losing sc@@ ar@@ ce animals .
and therefore , it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
over time , we &apos;re foc@@ using on big animals and in the ocean , these big fish .
they become more rare because we start to catch them .
there are little fish left over time , and we think that &apos;s the standard value .
and the question is why people accept this .
well , because they didn &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , con@@ fir@@ m that it was really different .
and they will con@@ fir@@ m it , because the evidence of how they are in a former form are not the way they would like the evidence to be present .
there &apos;s , for example , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te that the report of a chap@@ thou@@ se will be obser@@ ved in this area , not being used , can &apos;t be used by fis@@ her@@ y scientists or fis@@ her@@ y scientists , because it &apos;s not the sci@@ ences of &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have a situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in traditional societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enor@@ m@@ ously large role that can play a marine prote@@ cted area .
because through the surface of the reser@@ ve , we &apos;re actually re@@ stor@@ ing the past .
we bring back the past that people can &apos;t understand , because the natural values are changing and are very low .
so the people who see a marine reser@@ ve can come and benefit from the insi@@ ght that allow it to be their common level of the prob@@ ability .
what about the people that this is not possible , because they don &apos;t have access to the people in the mi@@ d-@@ west , for example ?
and here , i think , the art and the film maybe fill the gap , and simu@@ lations .
this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
now , a long time ago , there was cat@@ ac@@ als out there -- 500 years ago .
and the color of paint and ti@@ p@@ pers may remember &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; may be on &quot; a@@
if you think of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar &quot; if you think about why people were so tou@@ ched from this -- bes@@ i@@ des the po@@ ca@@ hon@@ ic story , why were they so tou@@ ched from the ima@@ ved world ?
because it calls something that &apos;s lost , in a certain way .
so , my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation is , the only one i &apos;m going to give you is c@@ amer@@ on , so he &apos;s ro@@ tat@@ ing &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii &quot; under@@ water .
thank you very much .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in the eastern eastern germany , you had to , if you were typ@@ ing a ty@@ pe@@ writer , to regi@@ ster them with government .
they also had to regi@@ ster a she@@ et of music text out of this ty@@ pe@@ writer .
the reason for this : the government was able to go back where a text came from .
if you had an article with fol@@ ded thought , you could dete@@ ct the cre@@ ators of that thought .
and we in the west couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , and how much would anyone con@@ stra@@ in the freedom of speech .
in our own countries , we would never have to do that .
but in fact , if you &apos;ve got a new color las@@ er prin@@ ter , buying a page , and print a page , then this page has shown the light yellow blo@@ om on every page , in a pattern that clearly prin@@ ts the page to you and rec@@ la@@ im your prin@@ te .
this is happening to us today .
and no one seems to break up about it .
and this was an example of how our own governments are using the technology against us , the citizens , together .
and this is one of the three main sources of today &apos;s online issues today .
so , let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divi@@ de the attac@@ ks in categ@@ ories .
we &apos;ve got three main groups .
and there are online crimin@@ als .
for example , here &apos;s mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ w from k@@ ho@@ w in u@@ kra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ ti@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these guys deser@@ ve money .
they use online attac@@ ks to ear@@ n a high amount of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online milli@@ on@@ ol@@ es , multi-@@ milli@@ on@@ on@@ times , that their money suff@@ ered from attac@@ ks .
this is w@@ wa@@ di@@ mir sa@@ st@@ an@@ ts from tar@@ tu in est@@ eland .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
it &apos;s ste@@ phen watt .
b@@ j@@ ori@@ al s@@ und@@ in .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ thers , and so on and so forth .
these people have come to wealth online , but they &apos;re illegal by using tro@@ j@@ ans to scre@@ w money out of our bank accoun@@ ts , while we do our online ban@@ king , or wr@@ an@@ tis@@ ers , who colle@@ cted our credit card information on the key@@ board as we shop over an infe@@ cted computer online .
u.s. intelligence agen@@ cy fro@@ r ago two months ago of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and in this con@@ go , there was 14@@ .@@ 9 million dollars when it was fro@@ zen .
and mr. ja@@ in himself is at the open foot , the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy place is un@@ known .
and i would argue it &apos;s more likely to be more likely to become vic@@ tim of a online crime than an agre@@ ery in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that it &apos;s going to be even worse .
and in the future , most cri@@ mes are going to be ahead .
the second biggest ad@@ ver@@ te@@ zed group that we can see today isn &apos;t motiv@@ ated by money .
it &apos;s motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sty about it , an opini@@ on , or through your audience .
groups like anony@@ mous have gone up over the last 12 months , and have become one of the main players on the field of online attac@@ ks .
so these are the three major re@@ vie@@ ws : crimin@@ als who do it for money , ha@@ ck@@ iness like anony@@ mous , who afford resi@@ stance , but the last group are nations , governments who run attac@@ king .
there are acci@@ dents of the mer@@ in@@ ot@@ ar that we &apos;re in .
it &apos;s a tremendous illu@@ stration of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
and gi@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a pe@@ cu@@ pi@@ zed from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or -- or it was .
last fall , it had to sign in@@ so@@ ven@@ an@@ ce , because there was a ha@@ cked in the last fall
somebody had broken and had the system ha@@ cked up th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
and last week , in a meeting with du@@ tch government offi@@ cial , i asked one of the sen@@ ior people to be asked , &quot; could he have died that because of the eastern bear of the gene .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying of a ha@@ ck like that ?
and gi@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fication .
they &apos;re selling cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
so what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
well , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate needs , if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with ss@@ t lo@@ cr@@ al services , for example .
now we all use , or a lot of us , g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are particularly distribu@@ ted to tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states such as the iran , where they know that the local government can be en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states , so that local government can &apos;t s@@ ni@@ ff around in their talks .
can you stick if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign foreign situation you can .
cer@@ ti@@ fication of ha@@ cks and fa@@ ke cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates make place .
and that &apos;s actually what &apos;s happened in the case of the logi@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
how does it compare to the arab spring and the things that , for example , in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
now , in eg@@ y@@ pt , the in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cy in apri@@ l , of course , put the head@@ quar@@ ters of the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an secre@@ ter , and they found a lot of recor@@ ds .
in these acts , a fol@@ der was called &quot; fin@@ fis@@ her@@ s . &quot;
and in that grid , however , there was notes in germany in germany that had sold a few programs to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government that they had -- in a very big scale -- any communic@@ ations of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens could under@@ mine .
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
the head@@ head@@ quar@@ ter is right here .
so western governments provide tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments to be able to do their own citizens against their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the so-@@ called state j@@ j@@ ors found , which was a tro@@ j@@ er who was used by ger@@ man government campaig@@ ners to rec@@ la@@ im their own citizens .
if you &apos;re wired in a crimin@@ al case , your phone will pretty much ta@@ p your phone .
but today , we &apos;re far beyond that .
they &apos;re ta@@ pping their internet connection .
they use the state of state like the national stream of a tro@@ j@@ er who allows them to monit@@ or their entire communic@@ ations , to stop their online discus@@ sions , to ga@@ ther their pas@@ s@@ words .
so if we continue to think about things like this , then the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not me because i &apos;m a lo@@ ver citi@@ zen .
don &apos;t have to worry about me !
i don &apos;t have anything to hi@@ de . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
priv@@ acy needs to be given .
priv@@ acy isn &apos;t going to debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between priv@@ acy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between liber@@ ty and in control .
and as we , in 2011 today , in the year 2011 , we like our governments to trust , is every place we give off forever .
and trust , we &apos;re blind to one of the future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
and these are the questions that we need to spend for the next 50 years .
it may seem od@@ d to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ ce blo@@ st@@ fish .
the first con@@ cre@@ te bri@@ cks were made 18@@ 6@@ 8 and created a simple idea : mo@@ du@@ le made of ic@@ ination with soli@@ d measu@@ re@@ ments that fit together .
con@@ cre@@ te blocks became very , very quickly , the most ma@@ ster@@ y-@@ prote@@ cted construction unit in the world .
they assem@@ bled us in ways to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one stone after another .
so essentially , the con@@ cre@@ te block of the em@@ ph@@ as@@ is had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , back in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came along with this .
it was called &quot; auto@@ matically commit@@ ment stone . &quot;
and within a few years , le@@ go moved into every hou@@ se@@ hold .
it &apos;s been esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion st@@ ones have been produced -- or 75 ro@@ cks for every person on the planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful buildings .
le@@ gos made it possible for everybody to do .
le@@ go essentially set up the con@@ cre@@ te block of the world , taken out the building block of the world and made a building block for our imagination .
in the mean@@ time , in the same year , in the bell lab@@ s , the next revolution announ@@ ced the next public block .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a little plastic unit that would bring us from a world of sta@@ tic , suc@@ c@@ essi@@ ged com@@ pounds into a world where everything would be inter@@ active .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows us to build much larger , more complex cir@@ ler , a bri@@ ff at a time .
but there &apos;s a real difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
personally , i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to investi@@ gate this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i began to develop li@@ tt@@ li@@ d@@ ans .
so let me show you how they work .
li@@ tt@@ li@@ its are electr@@ onic mo@@ du@@ le that has a specific function of function .
they &apos;re essential to being able to be light , sound , mot@@ or and sen@@ sor .
and the best part is they connect to magne@@ ts together .
so , you can &apos;t put it together in this way .
the st@@ ones are f@@ am@@ co@@ des .
green is out@@ le@@ ep , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is input , and orange is c@@ able .
so all you &apos;ve got to do is connect a blue and a green green , and you can build bigger cycle very quickly .
you put a blue to a green green , and you can make light .
and you can put a switch in between , and so you create a little pe@@ cker .
take the switch around a pul@@ se of a pul@@ se , which is here , and you &apos;ve made a little laun@@ ch of a little blind .
and put this bu@@ zz@@ er for an addi@@ tional effect , and you &apos;ve made a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
so , playing with the easy game is li@@ tt@@ li@@ per actually is quite powerful .
instead of going to code , you have to code or be@@ am , to allow li@@ tt@@ li@@ tes with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures , with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so in order to speed up , or slo@@ wing up the blin@@ ses , you just turn on that butt@@ on , and it makes the whe@@ el faster or slo@@ wer .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ li@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
so we want to put every single interaction on this world into a gener@@ ative sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding .
lights , c@@ ash , solar elements , eng@@ ines -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve de@@ dic@@ ated li@@ tt@@ li@@ ans to children and we can see them playing with it .
and it was an un@@ belie@@ vable experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics that you &apos;re doing in the everyday , and they don &apos;t learn at school .
like for example , it works a hal@@ f-@@ light , or why the do@@ ors of the el@@ ev@@ ator re@@ act , or how a ipo@@ d respon@@ ds to touch .
we &apos;ve also brought li@@ tt@@ lon@@ its to design schools .
for instance , we had designers with no experience in electr@@ onic things that began to play with li@@ tt@@ li@@ ans as the material .
and here we see , with fil@@ tz , paper and water bot@@ tles , like geor@@ es ...
a couple of weeks ago we brought out li@@ tt@@ li@@ per and we gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have any technologi@@ cal experience -- just car@@ ton and paper -- and they said , &quot; make a sense . &quot;
so here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a mov@@ ement@@ -@@ powered rec@@ ession of a project .
but hold on , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hum@@ mer from the black@@ ness , the fear of the dar@@ k@@ ness .
for this non-@@ engineers , li@@ tt@@ li@@ dies has another material , electr@@ on@@ ics just became one of these material .
and we want to make this material available for everybody to make available .
so li@@ tt@@ li@@ its open source is a source .
you can go to the website , down@@ load all the design direc@@ tions , and create them yourself .
we want to encoura@@ ge the world of the auth@@ ori@@ ties , the inv@@ ent@@ ors of com@@ passionate , because this world that we live in , that inter@@ active world bel@@ on@@ gs to us .
so , pull out and start to inv@@ ent them .
thank you very much .
