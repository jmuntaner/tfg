you know , one of the great guys of travel and one of the jo@@ ir@@ ings of eth@@ no@@ graph@@ ical research is to be living with people who can still remember the old days , who can still hold up to the old days , and who are still tou@@ ching them from the rain , taste them in the bit@@ ter leaves of the plant , and was@@ h them into the bit@@ ter leaves of the plant .
simply knowing that ja@@ go@@ -@@ sha@@ z@@ ans still travel beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the importance of my@@ ths of in@@ u@@ it , or the importance of my@@ ths of in@@ u@@ it , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the budd@@ h@@ ist still tra@@ ces the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma &apos;s breath , which is the idea that the world in which we live , not in absolute sense , is the idea that the world in which we live , not in absolute sense , but only as a model of reality as a con@@ sequence of a certain group of particular possibilities that our ancestors , the same successful , has sel@@ ec@@ ted the way we ancestors are .
and of course , we &apos;re all sharing the same adap@@ table ability .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we &apos;re running through initi@@ a@@ tional ritu@@ als .
we need to attra@@ ct ourselves with the emergen@@ ce separ@@ ation , and so we shouldn &apos;t be surprised that we all have to sing , dance and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhyth@@ m of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the pen@@ an in the fore@@ sts of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o acade@@ oly@@ th in haiti , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o acade@@ oly@@ th , or the war in the ca@@ is@@ i desert of northern kenya , or a car@@ a@@ van , in the middle of the sahar@@ a , which is a lot of the movies that i &apos;ve travel@@ ed with a desert month , or even a y@@ ak@@ i pad on the bottom of the q@@ om@@ ina ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ d@@ mother in the world .
and all of these people teach us that there are other kinds of reasons , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting on the earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , is that you can achieve just hope with hope .
together of the world &apos;s infin@@ ant cultures in the world , a network of spi@@ ritual and cultural life , which dra@@ ws the earth , and for the familiar of the earth as much as the biological life web that you know as bio@@ sphere , which is known as bio@@ sphere .
and you can imagine this cultural life network as a eth@@ no@@ sphere , eth@@ no@@ sphere can be as the total sum of all of the thoughts and dreams , my@@ th@@ est ideas , inspiration ra@@ tions and intui@@ tions that have been em@@ bed@@ ded by the beginning of consciousness since the beginning of consciousness has been defined .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is the great leg@@ acy of humanity &apos;s brilli@@ ance .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are capable of as won@@ dr@@ ous species of species .
and just as the bio@@ sphere was ri@@ pped up , this was what was happening with eth@@ no@@ sphere -- except even greater speed .
no biolog@@ ist would say , for example , to say that 50 percent or more , or more than the out@@ come , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this one -- the apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tical scen@@ ari@@ um in the area of biological diversity -- it &apos;s almost what &apos;s known to us as the most optimi@@ stic enti@@ tory in the area of the cultural diversity .
and the key indi@@ c@@ ator for that is the extin@@ ction of languages .
as each of you in this room were born , 6@@ ,000 languages were talking about the earth .
now , a language is not just the tot@@ ality of the vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ous , or a series of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ cky .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means to find the sou@@ l of a certain culture to find access to the physical world .
any language is like an ol@@ d-@@ reach@@ ing forest of the spirit , a turning point , an idea , an ecosystem , spi@@ ritual opportunity .
and from those 6@@ ,000 languages are going to be , as we &apos;re sitting here in mon@@ ter@@ ey , they &apos;re not going to s@@ hr@@ ink into the e@@ ars of children .
they &apos;re not going to teach c@@ ones , and that means , if there &apos;s nothing done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lon@@ ely , as the sil@@ ence of sil@@ ence , is one of the last one of your people who speak your language , no chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or expect children ?
and yet , this horri@@ ble fa@@ te actually consi@@ ds someone somewhere on earth , about two weeks , because of two weeks , an el@@ der@@ ly person is dying , and it takes the last sil@@ ent of a old language with the gra@@ ve .
and i know some of you say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better like that ? &quot; if the world isn &apos;t a better place if we all talk about one language ? &quot; and i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s be this language , yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s be kar@@ ton@@ es@@ ian . &quot;
let them be prototyp@@ i . &quot;
and then , suddenly , you &apos;d recognize what it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
and so today , i &apos;d like to take you on a trip with eth@@ no@@ sphere , a short journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to understand what &apos;s actually been lost .
now , there are some of us who , in a way , for@@ gotten that i say , when i say , &quot; different opportunities of one , &quot; really different ways of one of my things .
for example , take this child from bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west of the ama@@ zon , the people of an@@ a@@ kon@@ da , believe that they &apos;d come to my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally the mil@@ ky flow from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red s@@ ells .
this is a people that don &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish cogni@@ tively between the colors of blue and green , because the sky is sha@@ ped by the forest that people dep@@ end on .
they have a strange language , and there &apos;s a member of the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic ex@@ tr@@ am@@ ie : you have to mar@@ ry somebody who &apos;s talking about another language .
all of this is ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , and the lo@@ vely of these big houses , where the com@@ mis@@ sion@@ s are being talked about six or seven languages , is that you never hear anyone who lear@@ ns a language .
you just hear , and then start speaking .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i in the nor@@ the@@ ast of ecu@@ ad@@ or , an amazing people , which has been the first time in 195@@ 8 , has been lo@@ cked in the
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ary contact tried to record and make a serious er@@ ror .
they thre@@ w sh@@ in@@ y photos from the air , which we would find as a friend@@ ly gest@@ ure , and that &apos;s when they would have seen that these people from the rain@@ forest in their lives had never seen something two-@@ dimensional .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face or the figure , didn &apos;t find the figure , didn &apos;t recognize that this is business maps of de@@ vil , and they killed the five an@@ nu@@ aries with the spe@@ er .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t kill just the sig@@ ns with the spe@@ er .
they were re@@ fin@@ ed by each other .
5@@ 4 percent of the dea@@ ths were born by re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation .
we followed in the gene@@ a@@ ology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural body , and when we asked people a little bit about pres@@ sur@@ ation , they gave them that one of the people got so old that he had died the age of his al@@ pris@@ ers , and we &apos;d still kill him with the spe@@ er .
but at the same time , they had a clear sense of the wh@@ ale that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
their predat@@ ors were able to smell the ur@@ in of a animal from 40 steps and deter@@ mine what wild@@ species had heard of this .
in the early 198@@ 0s , i got a really ast@@ on@@ ishing task when my professor asked me if i was interested in college and to in@@ fil@@ tra@@ te the secret societies that was the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ ans and clay ma@@ cou@@ tes , and the tox@@ ation that was used to do to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es , make sure the tox@@ ation was used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
in order to give sense a sense , of course , i had to tell a little bit about this remarkable belief of the mer@@ ana knowledge and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a culture of black magic .
in the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex meta@@ physical world@@ view .
well , it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you , what would you do to count the great world sec@@ tors , what would you say ?
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , budd@@ h@@ ism , ju@@ da@@ ism , or whatever .
a continent continu@@ ed out , because the assu@@ mption was that in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , there was no religious faith , and of course there was a vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is just the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming of these very profound religious thoughts that emer@@ ged during the tra@@ gic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of sla@@ very during sla@@ very time .
but what vo@@ o@@ do@@ o does so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living ones are the spi@@ ri@@ ti@@ sts .
the spi@@ ri@@ ts can be sp@@ lin@@ ed under the big water , respon@@ ding to the rhyth@@ m of dance , answers to the rhyth@@ m of the living , so that the ei@@ l of the living is going to become a little cele@@ br@@ ate moment for a very short moment to the god .
now , the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like , &quot; your white goes to the church and talking about god .
we dance in the temp@@ le , and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obs@@ essed , you &apos;re going to take off of your spirit . how can you be har@@ m ?
if you look at these amazing demon@@ stra@@ tions : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ ths in a trans@@ ce@@ u@@ tical state , the glo@@ wing char@@ coal without dr@@ un@@ sis , an amazing illu@@ stration of the ability to influence the body &apos;s ability to make the body so that it causes it when it comes into a state of extreme ar@@ re@@ sion .
now , of all the people i met were the kog@@ i from si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de s@@ ant@@ a mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia , the most extraordinary one .
in the ancient ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ an civilization , which killed the car@@ ib@@ bi@@ an co@@ ast@@ al orche@@ str@@ a , and at the end of the cen@@ su@@ s , these people moved back into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ ve , ris@@ ing over the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ ir@@ a .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed continent , these people who had never been the only ones that had never been avo@@ i@@ ded by the sp@@ ani@@ ans .
up to today &apos;s day , they &apos;re gover@@ ned by a ritual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od , and it &apos;s very extraordinary to the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od education .
the young ac@@ oly@@ sters are separ@@ ated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a sha@@ k@@ sha@@ dy world of dar@@ k@@ ness , in stone hu@@ ds , the gl@@ aci@@ ers of the year of 18 years , ele@@ cted by the ma@@ ple@@ er for 18 years , ele@@ cted by the nine months of preg@@ nan@@ cy that they spend in the dinner of their quie@@ t mother , now they spend me@@ tam@@ or@@ ph@@ or@@ or@@ ically in the wake of the great mother .
and during that entire time , they will be cul@@ tur@@ ally adop@@ ted in the values of their society , values that encoura@@ ge the cla@@ im that their pra@@ yers and only their pra@@ yers , the co@@ s@@ mic -- or we could say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- equ@@ ally , we could say the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical -- equ@@ ili@@ bri@@
at the end of this magni@@ fi@@ cent initi@@ ation , one day , one day , one day , one day in your life , you &apos;re going to see a sun@@ rise . and in this cr@@ y@@ stal@@ ous moment of consciousness , you see a sun@@ rise . and in this cr@@ y@@ stal@@ ous moment of consciousness , when the sun begins to radiation the l@@ ength of the magni@@ fi@@ cent landscape , suddenly everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstra@@ ct , and the pri@@ est goes back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really , i &apos;ve told you ? it &apos;s really what i told you ?
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they &apos;re called the older brothers and saying that we are the yo@@ unger brothers are responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intui@@ tions is going to be very important .
so whenever we think about the in@@ na@@ te and landscape , we have either pr@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old embar@@ ras@@ sing wil@@ ds of no@@ ble wil@@ ds , which is a ra@@ ti@@ le idea , or the other one , th@@ ore@@ au and saying , these people are connected to nature than we do .
so , indi@@ ans aren &apos;t sen@@ ti@@ mental , they &apos;re still sho@@ ot@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
it doesn &apos;t matter a lot of space for as@@ m@@ at , or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , or the cold win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they &apos;re still sha@@ ped away by time and ritual a myster@@ i@@ ous ni@@ m@@ o of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of it , but in a far more sub@@ tle purpose , the idea that the earth can only exist , because it &apos;s brea@@ th@@ ed into the human consciousness .
so , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child who gro@@ ws in the belief that &apos;s growing up in faith that the mountain is an a@@ pu@@ -@@ mind , who deter@@ mine her fa@@ te , will be a different person going to become a different person , and another relationship with this resource or this place , as a small child from mon@@ tan@@ a , who is growing up in belief that a mountain is a bunch of stone that can be traff@@ i@@ cked .
whether it &apos;s a place of a spirit or a pi@@ le , it &apos;s ir@@ relevant .
the interesting thing is , the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the fore@@ sts of british col@@ om@@ bia , and i believed that these fore@@ sts are being cle@@ am@@ ed .
this led me to another person as my friends under the k@@ was@@ ki@@ dr@@ l , who believe that these fore@@ sts of the ar@@ tery place of hu@@ ku@@ k and the war@@ ni@@ bal@@ ic spirit and the can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ian spirit , who were operating at the northern world , the spi@@ ri@@ ts of the world , the spi@@ ri@@ ts that they would be enga@@ ged to their ha@@ mat@@ sa@@ -@@ initi@@ ation .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different reali@@ ties , you can understand some of your extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies , so that plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last apri@@ l in the northern west of the ama@@ zon of the ama@@ zon .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard , the most powerful psycho@@ active pre@@ ge@@ sti@@ on from the re@@ per@@ toi@@ re of the sha@@ hm@@ ana .
what ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca makes so fascinating is not just the pharma@@ ce@@ ological potential of this pre@@ mis@@ e , but the process@@ ing . it &apos;s really made out of two different sources . on the one hand , there are these woo@@ den li@@ ps , which is a series of wood li@@ es , har@@ m@@ in , har@@ mo@@ lin , ligh@@ ts . these clim@@ bers plant alone is a little bit like a blue tr@@ un@@ k of smo@@ ke on their consciousness , but it &apos;s being mix@@ ed with the leaves of a beach from the coffee plant , but it &apos;s being mix@@ ed with the leaves of a beach from the coffee product , but it &apos;s being mix@@ ed with the leaves of the coffee product with psych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
this plant con@@ tains some very strong tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins that are the ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ ium tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in 5 and metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ c@@ on y@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ in in very similar .
and if you saw the y@@ an@@ o@@ tz@@ i , how you sha@@ ke this stuff , this sub@@ stance that they &apos;re doing from different species also manu@@ tains path@@ y@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ c@@ in in size .
now , the po@@ w@@ der is sort of s@@ hr@@ in@@ king the way out of a pi@@ cket , spra@@ yed by b@@ aro@@ ks pain@@ t@@ ings and the land@@ ing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create the reality , but the resol@@ ution of reality is the resol@@ ution .
in fact , i was with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ ter , the man who had cap@@ tured the psy@@ che@@ deli@@ c oper@@ re@@ a with the discovery of the magic mush@@ rooms in mexico in the 3@@ 0@@ 0s , discus@@ sing it . i said you couldn &apos;t inclu@@ de those tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as a hallu@@ cin@@ o@@ gen , because at the moment you feel the effects you can &apos;t be there to experience a hallu@@ cin@@ ation .
but the thing about the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins is that they can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be the equivalent of the enzy@@ be in the world , of course , in the human gut , in which mon@@ o@@ am@@ in-@@ o@@ xi@@ d@@ ase , den@@
they can only be done with a couple of other chemicals that ma@@ w the ma@@ o forces .
now , the amazing thing is that the oper@@ ates that con@@ tain in the li@@ an@@ e are ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , ma@@ o-@@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of exactly the same kind of thing that is necessary to modi@@ fy the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ins , and ask yourself .
how can these people from a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence can &apos;t find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally related plants , which , if in this way combin@@ ed , create a kind of bio@@ chemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this magni@@ fi@@ cent eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , and try to try and er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate and er@@ ror what &apos;s going on as a real way .
but if you ask the indi@@ ans , they say , &quot; the plant spea@@ ks to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ ble , have 17 var@@ ie@@ ties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which you all recognize at a lot of distance in the forest , which appe@@ ars to be the same as a species .
and then you ask them how to do your tax@@ on@@ om@@ ie , and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;d understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything at all ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that every of the 17 vari@@ ants you take in the full moon and you &apos;re sing@@ ing in a different ton@@ o .
now , this brings you not a ph@@ .@@ d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than a sla@@ ina to count .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have sym@@ pathy for the hard circum@@ stances of the people , they as or@@ g@@ in@@ ell and color@@ ful , but it &apos;s sort of con@@ stra@@ ined to the past , as the real world , the world , is moving .
so , the fact is that in 300 years , in 300 years , in 300 years , not being remem@@ ber@@ ed for its wars or technical innova@@ tions , but rather than being an era where we &apos;ve been against , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on the earth are either active or passi@@ vely accep@@ ted , so the problem is not change .
and all cultures have been involved in the dance with new living activi@@ ties .
and the problem is not the technology itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans didn &apos;t stop less on si@@ ou@@ x , when they and ar@@ row tas@@ ks , as americans listen@@ ed to being americans , when they &apos;re doing horse and hor@@ ch@@ board .
not change and technology thre@@ ats the integri@@ ty of eth@@ no@@ sphere . it &apos;s power . it &apos;s the ug@@ ly face of the rule .
and wher@@ ever you &apos;re looking around in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures aren &apos;t re@@ duced to the out@@ come . these are dynamic living peop@@ les whose existence by percei@@ vable forces will be avo@@ i@@ ded by their capacity . whether it &apos;s the most extreme de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the home@@ land of pen@@ an , a no@@ ma@@ ti@@ ri@@ c people from sou@@ op@@ ast asia , from sar@@ a@@ wa@@ k , a people who lived in front of a generation , and are now being hu@@ mili@@ ated on the fl@@ au@@ f and pro@@ stit@@ ution on the river of the forest , and now they &apos;ve become hu@@ mili@@ ation and pro@@ stit@@ ution on the river of the ocean , which is willing to fill up their ships with ra@@ w trees that they &apos;ve de@@ alt to the forest , or like y@@ an@@ o@@ que@@ i , where they &apos;re non-@@ resi@@ stant during the gul@@ f of the gul@@ f , or as the case of y@@ an@@ o@@ que@@ i , where they &apos;re poli@@ cies that are consum@@ ed during the gul@@ f of the gul@@ f .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i recently do a lot of press , you &apos;ll see the ug@@ ly face of the political domin@@ ance .
you know , the geno@@ ci@@ d , the physi@@ ological extin@@ ction of people are consi@@ stent in general , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ d , the destruction of the lives of people , is not just con@@ vi@@ cted , but generally , and more sophisti@@ cated as a part of a develop@@ mental strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering ti@@ red if you don &apos;t experience it at the bottom of the sub@@ test .
i used to ride 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du from ch@@ eng@@ du in west china from sou@@ do@@ ast ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a , and only when i came to l@@ has@@ a , i saw the face behind the statistics of which you hear , and 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents that were trans@@ formed in fra@@ ckets and a@@ ils . 1.@@ 2 million people who were mur@@ dered during the city revolution by the ca@@ v@@ ans .
the father of this young man was identi@@ fied as being identi@@ fied by the pan@@ le lam@@ a .
that meant that he was being killed during the chinese invasi@@ on during the chinese invasi@@ on .
his un@@ cle fle@@ w with her hol@@ iness to the di@@ as@@ por@@ a , who brought people to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was caught , as pun@@ ish@@ ment for being -- to be weal@@ thy for cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ hood .
he was s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed in ja@@ il for two years to hi@@ de under her rock , because she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister who was doing this bra@@ ve act was brought into a education camp .
one day , they fle@@ w on a black@@ board ma@@ os , and they had to get them into a heavy work@@ way for seven years into a really heavy work camp .
the suffering of suffering can be unbe@@ at@@ able , but the im@@ per@@ ative spirit of people is a little bit un@@ for@@ ge@@ ten@@ able .
and at the end of the end , we &apos;re really in a ele@@ ction , are we going to live in a mon@@ o@@ chro@@ ma@@ tic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or in a poly@@ chro@@ ma@@ tic world of diversity
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist said before she died , that it was her greatest fear , that while we moved towards a soli@@ d , mis@@ er@@ able , gener@@ ic world@@ view , we would not only be re@@ duced to the entire range of human imagination in a significant way , but that we were going to wake up from a dream , and we for@@ got out of a dream and for@@ gotten that there was ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bled to think that our species may have exi@@ sted for about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 years .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ian revolution that brought us agriculture , and at this moment , the cul@@ t of the sa@@ at@@ kor@@ n , the poetry of the sha@@ ir through the pre@@ c@@ ir@@ hood of the pri@@ est of the pri@@ est and hier@@ arch@@ y created -- only 10,000 years ago , only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world , as we know it is har@@ dly 300 years old .
now , this ta@@ un@@ ting story is not telling me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the emerging mil@@ len@@ nia .
if we ask these el@@ ro@@ sting world cultures &apos; meaning , they &apos;re respon@@ ding with 10,000 different voices , they &apos;re respon@@ ding with 10,000
and in this song , we &apos;re going to re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : people with a lot of consciousness who &apos;s aware of the importance of importance that all humans and gar@@ dens need to be able to be able to be able to deliver a space . and there &apos;s great moments of optimis@@ m .
here &apos;s a photograph i recor@@ ded at the northern end of the ba@@ ff@@ in is@@ lands when i went to the nar@@ ran@@ an h@@ unt , and this guy , ol@@ a@@ ya , told me a wonderful story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been very good with the in@@ u@@ it , and during the 50@@ th years , in the end of our char@@ ity , they were forced to take care of sett@@ le@@ ments .
the grand@@ father &apos;s grand@@ father &apos;s grand@@ father disappe@@ ared .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the g@@ uns , and all the tools .
now , you have to know that the in@@ u@@ it doesn &apos;t have any fear of cold , they &apos;re using them to their advantage .
the clo@@ th@@ es of their sh@@ ots were origin@@ ally made of fish that was cap@@ tured in car@@ bu@@ a &apos;s skin .
the grand@@ father &apos;s grand@@ father didn &apos;t fear the arc@@ tic night or the was@@ hing stor@@ m .
he had s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed out , thre@@ w his pil@@ es out of the sea toi@@ let and de@@ fe@@ st@@ ated his hand , and as the dy@@ ces started free@@ zing , he sha@@ ped them into the shape of a kni@@ tri@@ fi@@ ce .
it was spra@@ ying stor@@ es on the sides of the fi@@ po@@ ali@@ an kni@@ fe , and when it was completely fro@@ zen , he &apos;s really ama@@ zed with it .
he built the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ing a failure , took the skelet@@ on of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ing a guy , and he was impro@@ vis@@ ing another dog , and i was de@@ vis@@ ing over the ice she@@ ets with the fi@@ po@@ ral kni@@ fe on the b@@ elt .
you can do something from nothing .
and this is a symbol in many ways an ic@@ ori@@ zed symbol of in@@ u@@ it and all of the people in the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government gave the in@@ u@@ it in apri@@ l in apri@@ l in 199@@ 9 in 199@@ 9 , which is bigger than california and texas combin@@ ed .
it &apos;s our new home@@ land , and it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ a@@ v@@ ols .
it &apos;s an independent area . you &apos;re all controll@@ ing the miner@@ al .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can be se@@ arch@@ ing and reach@@ es with its in@@ habit@@ ants .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are travel@@ ing to these dist@@ ant steps of the earth , reali@@ zing that they &apos;re not going to be away at all .
they &apos;re the countries of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination coming back in the past time , and for all of us , the dreams of these children will become the dreams of these children , the dreams of our own children of geogra@@ ph@@ y of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think that politicians will never achieve something .
we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs -- we believe that po@@ le@@ mi@@ cs is not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we believe that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for story@@ telling in the world . our website gets 35 million ap@@ ples per month .
15@@ 6 nations send us our television chan@@ nel .
our maga@@ zin@@ es are read by millions of years .
and we &apos;re enter@@ ing a series of travel to eth@@ no@@ sphere , where we &apos;re taking our audi@@ ences to places from such cultural ad@@ vis@@ ers , that they are provi@@ ded by the familiar ones , and hopefully you &apos;ll assu@@ me one after the other fron@@ tier of anthropo@@ log@@ y : that this world has ear@@ ned to exist in different ways that we can find a living opportunity in a truly mul@@ tic@@ able species , where the wisdom of all humans can contribu@@ te to our common well-@@ being .
thank you very much .
what i first want to do is show you as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that allows us to go out of microsoft as part of a year ago , and that &apos;s se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s a environment where you either can deal lo@@ cally or re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of visual data with enormous amo@@ unts of visual data .
we see a lot of , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photographs here that you can se@@ ttle and continue and continue and continue in the same way , just to re-@@ constru@@ ct it in some way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many of the information we &apos;re looking at how big these colle@@ ctions are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photograph@@ ing of a camera , but this is , for example , a scan from the library library , and it &apos;s in a section of 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ s .
it makes no difference , because the only thing that can be limited to the power of a system like this is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen in every moment , it has a very flexi@@ ble architecture of architecture . it &apos;s also a very flexi@@ ble
this is a whole book , an example of lack of lack of data .
this is b@@ le@@ k &apos;s house of di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about an image , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the tex@@ ts and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an email book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
this is a more reali@@ stic case . this is a copy of the guar@@ di@@ an .
every big picture is the beginning of a section of a section .
and that &apos;s really giving you the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real paper paper or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several orders of magni@@ tude .
we &apos;ve also done something about the corner of this particular copy of the guar@@ di@@ an &apos;s particular .
we designed a fal@@ se ad with very high resol@@ ution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we ad@@ ded addi@@ tional content .
if you want to look at the fun@@ ctions of this cars , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
and this is really what these ideas are doing to capture these limit@@ ations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that doesn &apos;t mean po@@ p-@@ u@@ ps and other things -- it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the ma@@ pping is one of the really obvious app@@ lic@@ ation for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re also contribu@@ ted to this area .
but these are all roads in the u.@@ s@@ .@@ a .
in the top of nasa , over the top of nasa &apos;s resol@@ ution .
so let &apos;s just get out of something else .
now , this is actually live on the internet . you can check it .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really conne@@ cts two different technologies together .
one is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is a very good research of no@@ ah sc@@ mor , a university university university university , under the u@@ v of steve hu@@ tz at u@@ w
and ri@@ ck s@@ c@@ li@@ sk@@ i was done by microsoft research . it &apos;s a very good collaboration .
so , this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
and you can see this , if we create this kind of vie@@ ws , where we can engage through images , and make this experience of a multi@@ pli@@ city of multi@@
but the spa@@ tial con@@ figu@@ ration of the pictures is actually relevant .
now , the computer visi@@ on algorith@@ ms made these pictures together so they had the real room that all of us are made near the cap@@ s@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ et@@ ies , consi@@ stent , and they &apos;re looking at elements of the very color@@ ful sli@@ des or pan@@ or@@ am@@ an ima@@ ging , and these things were all shif@@ ted to each other in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t really know if i &apos;ve got time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more al@@ ficial .
i &apos;d like to go straight to one of the original dat@@ ers of no@@ ah , and this is from a early prototyp@@ e of photo@@ syn@@ th that we &apos;ve been working on the first time in the early summer , to show you what i think is really the bang behind this technology , which is photo@@ syn@@ und@@ i@@ zed technology , and this is not necessarily as obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
and we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
this is a re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of the ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral ep@@ re d@@ ame , who was inspired by the course of fli@@ ck@@ r with pictures of fli@@ ck@@ r . give you an app@@ re d@@ ame in fli@@ ck@@ r , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-@@ shir@@ ts and at the university of university , and so on at the university of college , and each of these orange bu@@ les represents a picture that has been obser@@ ved to this model .
so these are all fli@@ ck@@ ling images , and they &apos;re all going to be in relation to each other in relation to each other
and we can navi@@ gate this very simple way of navi@@ gation .
you know , i never believed that i was going to work at the end of microsoft at all .
and i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful for the re@@ vel@@ ator here .
and i sus@@ pe@@ ct you can see that these are a lot of different kinds of c@@ ameras : everything is , from the hand camera to professional sl@@ ber , a pretty large number of them that have all been fli@@ cked up in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange ones .
many of them are con@@ stra@@ ined by faces and so on .
and somewhere there are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by not@@ re d@@ ame , which has been recor@@ ded right .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of that environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , it &apos;s now colle@@ cted data from all of us -- from all of the collective stor@@ es of how , visu@@ ally the earth looks -- and everything is connected to each other .
all of these photographs are lin@@ ked together , and it buil@@ ds something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of parts .
they get a model coming out of all over the earth .
if you look at this as the progress of ste@@ phen law@@ ler &apos;s work on virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that is about the comple@@ xi@@ ties that people use it , growing and its use for the user with the app@@ lic@@ ation increasingly .
your own photos will be was@@ hed with meta@@ data , who has put another person in a different person .
and if someone has done mo@@ ther@@ ers and com@@ pla@@ ined all of these sac@@ red hol@@ es and tell who you &apos;re all , then my photo from the ep@@ re dam ca@@ the@@ d@@ ral , suddenly with all this data , and i can use it as a starting point to get into this space , into these meta@@ sites that are using photographs of other people and create a kind of tran@@ scen@@ dent model of development with the use of other users .
and of course , side of all of these things are the most enormous virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , which is not just through tran@@ fli@@ ction or satelli@@ te images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you very much .
do i understand it right ? your software allows that at a certain time , within the next few years , all the images that are used by somebody in the world are basically being connected to each other ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t happen other than you .
if you want to create hyper@@ links between your pain@@ t@@ ings .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the increase of the se@@ mani@@ tic information that many of these images have .
how if you take a web search for pictures , where you give up sent@@ ences , and the text of the website con@@ tains a lot of information about what is the picture .
but what about when the image does it all the way through its pain@@ t@@ ings ?
and then the scop@@ e of se@@ man@@ tical distribution and the amount that makes it is really enormous . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network of a lot of intellectual networks .
bla@@ ise , that &apos;s really incredible . it &apos;s very , very , very weal@@
thank you very much indeed .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book , the way i hope , in terms of other things that you &apos;ve already heard of , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections if you haven &apos;t noticed them .
i want to start with what i call &quot; offi@@ ci@@ al do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
offi@@ cially , the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the offi@@ ci@@ al faith of all western industri@@ alized societies .
the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma works : when our goal is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the public well-@@ being of our citizens , it &apos;s particularly by ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the freedom of the individuals .
the reason for that is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaning@@ ful , an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented assu@@ mption for human beings .
if people have freedom , each of us will be doing for themselves to do things that ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our common good , and no one has to decide .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze , to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@
the more choices that people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common good they have .
this is , i think , deep in our water supply , that it &apos;s not going to be in the sense that it &apos;s not going to question it .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
so i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
this is my super@@ market . there &apos;s no big one .
i just want to say just a little bit about sal@@ at@@ le@@ res@@ sing .
there are 17@@ 5 d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different kinds of o@@ live tumor@@ s and you could buy 12 bal@@ gab@@ i@@ per avail@@ ner@@ es that you could buy to make a large number of your own sal@@ at of des@@ s@@ ings , in the un@@ likely case that none of the 17@@ 5 in the store is right for you .
so , that &apos;s what the super@@ market is .
and then they go to the consumer electr@@ on@@ ics business to put together a stere@@ o of a stere@@ o -- lou@@ d@@ speak@@ ers , c@@ d player , a c@@ asse@@ tte player , radio , stron@@ ger , and in this one electr@@ on@@ ics , there &apos;s a lot of stere@@ o facili@@ ties .
we can put 6@@ .@@ 5 million different stere@@ o facili@@ ties together from the components that are being off@@ ered in this one business .
you have to ad@@ mit that this is a big choice .
in other parts of communication -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , so you could have a tele@@ phone bag of every tele@@ phone that you wanted to do , as long as he came from ma bell .
they quot@@ ed their tele@@ phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one of the consequences was that the tele@@ phone was never sh@@ opp@@ ed .
so these days are over .
we now have almost an infin@@ ite sele@@ ction of tele@@ phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
this is the mobile tele@@ phones of the future .
my favorite is the one in the middle -- mp@@ 3 play@@ ware , nas@@ e-@@ ha@@ ir@@ ering and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ ei@@ ple@@ stor@@ e ver@@ k@@ in .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this until now in your business , you can be sure you &apos;re going to be going to be going to go soon .
and what it does is it brings people to walk into business and ask that question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
and the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell@@ phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspe@@ cts of life , which are a lot more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you &apos;re going to go to the doctor , and the ph@@ .@@ d. tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor says , we could do a , or we could do a b , or we could make b .
a has these advan@@ tages and risks .
b has these advan@@ tages and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the ph@@ .@@ d. says a has these benefits and risks and b and b has the benefits and the risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , you know , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not y@@ ours . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift is a shift of the bur@@ den of responsibility for someone who knows something -- nam@@ ely the ph@@ .@@ d. -- to someone who knows nothing , and that &apos;s not the best const@@ it@@ ution , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not in the best const@@ it@@ ution to make a decision -- nam@@ ely the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for pres@@ cri@@ ption medicine for people like you and me , and that , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they com@@ pla@@ ance to us if we can &apos;t buy ?
and the answer is , you &apos;d expect the ph@@ .@@ d. for the next morning and to ask a change change , and to ask a change change .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , a question of how this slide should show .
we don &apos;t get identity , we &apos;re inv@@ enting them .
and we &apos;re inv@@ enting so often as we want to do .
that means that every day , if you wake up in the morning , they have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
and in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assu@@ mption was that almost everyone had one and they were able to get married as they could , and then quickly would get children like they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , not when , and not what they did .
no@@ wa@@ days , everything &apos;s just easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did earlier .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less wor@@ k@@ ness .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re involved with other things , you ask yourself yourself , &quot; should i be married or not ? should i get married ?
should i be hun@@ ting later ? should i have children , or just make a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all involved about all sorts of questions
and you &apos;re going to worry about these questions of whether that means to do all the tas@@ ks that i &apos;m trying to do and not get good audi@@ les in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to stopp@@ ing questions .
work -- we &apos;re bl@@ essed , as car@@ l has shown , with the technologies that allow us to work every minute from every day on the planet -- until the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
there &apos;s , by the way , a corner i &apos;m not going to tell you about that , by the way that the mel@@ ting plan works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you about it , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of jobs , again and again and again , whether we should work or not to work or not .
we can look at our kids in foot@@ ball , and we have our mobile phone on the front of a hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on other hi@@ p , and our laptop probably on our la@@ p .
and even if you &apos;re all swi@@ t@@ ched down , every minute in which we &apos;re going to look at our child &apos;s wir@@ es of a foot@@ ball game , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i accept that call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write that letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of foot@@ foot@@ ball &apos;s experience very different than it would have been .
anywhere we see , big things and little things , material things , material things and lifest@@ yle , life is a matter of choice .
and the world that we lived in lived like this .
and that &apos;s what i want to say , there were some choices , but not all of a matter of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re looking at now is this .
and the question is , are the good news or the bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s wrong about it .
so all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , parado@@ x@@ er , is that it &apos;s going to be paraly@@ zed instead of free .
with so many op@@ tions that you can choose , people are very hard to vote at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another dra@@ gic example of this , a study of invest@@ ing in volunte@@ ers in volunte@@ er age care .
a collea@@ gue of mine had had access to invest@@ ments of van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic fe@@ ent@@ or society of about one million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund@@ ing that emplo@@ yed emplo@@ yers , they took care of two percent .
they give 50 investment fund@@ ing -- 10 percent less employees spend part as if they were only going to offer five percent . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fun@@ ds who are pur@@ su@@ ing , it &apos;s so hard to decide which you should choose to get it up to you tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come .
do you understand that this is not just that people have to eat dog food if they &apos;re in the reti@@ re@@ ment , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it means , the decision is so hard that they miss great investment fund@@ ing their emplo@@ yer .
through that not participa@@ tion , they give them to 5,000 or 5,000 dollars a year on the emplo@@ yer , who would have been happy to re@@ produce their contribu@@ tion .
paraly@@ sis is a con@@ sequence from a lot of choices .
and i think it makes the fact that the world looks like this .
you really want to make the decision right , if it &apos;s for all of your da@@ st@@ ness , right ?
they don &apos;t want to ele@@ ct the fal@@ se colle@@ ctor , or even the wrong sal@@ at@@ board res@@ cu@@ e .
so that &apos;s the one effect . the other effect is that even if we over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a decision , we end less satis@@ fied with the out@@ come of choice , as if we had the opportunity to decide anything between less means .
and there &apos;s a couple of reasons for this .
one of them is im@@ it@@ ated by the great pur@@ pos@@ es of different sal@@ at@@ age res@@ cu@@ es , when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is sal@@ at@@ e@@ res@@ sing , it &apos;s perfectly perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you can have a different decision , and what &apos;s going on is that you can have a different decision to address the decision , and that ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy appe@@ ars nega@@ tively to happiness that they made their loved decision , even if it was a good decision .
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is to con@@ gre@@ t at all this is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting for the ele@@ ction that they make .
second , which econom@@ ists call op@@ per@@ op@@ ia &apos;s expen@@ se .
dan gil@@ bert has done a big point of this morning by telling us how much the way we st@@ are things from it , depen@@ ds on what we compare .
well , if there are lots of alterna@@ tives to conver@@ t , it &apos;s just attra@@ ctive properties of the alterna@@ tives that ex@@ clu@@ de them , that makes them less satis@@ fied with the alterna@@ tives that they &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who don &apos;t have new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought of .
here &apos;s a couple of on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
very expensive real e@@ state .
beautiful beach . great day . they &apos;ve got it all for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; evil thinks &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone away .
i could park my house in front of my house . &quot;
and he pres@@ ents two weeks from the thought that he &apos;s de@@ vot@@ ed to the possibility of day , day after day , having a great par@@ king lot .
op@@ per@@ a &apos;s expen@@ se is the satis@@ fac@@ tion that we recei@@ ve through our choices , even if we &apos;re looking at what we &apos;re looking for .
and the more choices that are provi@@ ded , the more attra@@ ctive properties of these choices are consi@@ der@@ ed into the op@@ per@@ op@@ ia .
here &apos;s another example of this .
now , this carto@@ on makes a couple of stat@@ ement .
he makes a stat@@ ement about now , and maybe about doing things , and maybe about doing things slowly .
but an important point that he does is , always who is doing you to decide for one thing , don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things might have lots of attra@@ ctive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do to do less .
thir@@ dly , es@@ ph@@ ation of expec@@ tations .
this stru@@ ck me when i wanted to go to my je@@ ans .
i wear je@@ ans , almost all of the time .
and there was a time in which there was only je@@ ans of one species , and they bought them , and they were feeling bad , they were incredibly un@@ com@@ pati@@ ble , and if they were wearing them long enough , and they were was@@ hed enough enough , they had started to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
so , in order to buy new je@@ ans after many years of training , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of je@@ ans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the s@@ eller said , &quot; do you want a sna@@ ke , easy , easy , or infin@@ ity ?
do you want to was@@ h butt@@ ons or ri@@ p ? stone or ac@@ id was@@ hes ?
do you want to li@@ ve@@ re je@@ ans with holes ?
do you want to cut off the bottom , swe@@ et , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h . &quot; and so on , he said .
and my ja@@ w was down , and after i re@@ je@@ cted , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only thing was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour to try all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and the business -- and i said the truth -- and i said the truth -- with the best pas@@ sing je@@ ans that i ever had .
i made it better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
but , i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i was bad was worse , with all of these available choices , my expec@@ tations for what makes a good couple of je@@ ans , went up .
i had very low expec@@ tations . i didn &apos;t have any con@@ cre@@ te expec@@ tations than they were just in a way .
when they came in 100 species , one of them should have been perfect , you &apos;d have to be perfect .
and what i was doing was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i ad@@ ver@@ ted what i expected , what i expected , and what i had was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted to what i expected .
increasingly for opportunities in people &apos;s lives inevi@@ t@@ ably inevi@@ t@@ ably the expec@@ tations that people have to be about how well they &apos;re going to be .
and this leads to less satis@@ fac@@ tion with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if you were to , you &apos;d not know what it &apos;s going to be here .
and the truth is more like this .
the reason is , which previ@@ ously was better than anything worse than anything worse than anything worse , it was possible for people to make experiences that were a pleas@@ ant surprise .
no@@ wa@@ days , in the world that we live -- we &apos;re weal@@ thy , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfe@@ ction as a expec@@ tation -- the best thing you can ever hope to hope is things as good as you expect them .
you &apos;re never going to be comfortable , because your expec@@ tations , my expec@@ tations , are hou@@ se-@@ ful .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what all of you have come up -- the secret to happiness is low expec@@ tations .
i want to say -- a short auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phic moment -- which i &apos;m married with a woman , and it &apos;s really wonder@@ fully wonderful .
i didn &apos;t have to do it better . i didn &apos;t have to re@@ je@@ ct myself .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing that &apos;s a bad thing .
finally , a con@@ sequence of the pur@@ suit of a bad gather@@ ing je@@ ans when there &apos;s only one way to buy , that if you &apos;re un@@ satis@@ fied , and you wonder why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you do ?
if there are hundreds of different kinds of je@@ ans available , and you buy one of the dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ments , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
so , is it obvious that the answer to the question is : it is .
you could have done it better .
with 100 different species of je@@ ans , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for er@@ ror , there &apos;s no exc@@ use for er@@ ror .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ingly , they &apos;re acc@@ essi@@ ble to themselves .
clin@@ ic depression explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only one , but a significant contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also su@@ i@@ cide , is that people have learned the dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment because their standards are so high because their standards are so high . and then , if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think it &apos;s their fau@@ lt .
and so the ima@@ gery is that it &apos;s more better to us , obje@@ ctive , and we feel worse , and we feel worse .
so , let me remember you .
this is the offi@@ cial do@@ g@@ ma , which is one that we all think is wrong , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choice than something , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choice than something .
there &apos;s a ma@@ gical amount of stuff . i don &apos;t know what it is .
and i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve mis@@ sed this do@@ t for a long time in terms of the sele@@ ction of our common good .
now , as a stat@@ ement question -- i &apos;m almost comple@@ ted -- as a basic question , the thing about thinking about what all of these choices is in the developed societies , the material is wealth .
there are a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem is not that big choice .
your problem is that they have too little .
so , the things that i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so fru@@ str@@ ating and pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly , steve le@@ vi@@ tt talked about yesterday about how this expensive and hard not to help the in@@ complete car se@@ ats , and it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m saying to you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy that they &apos;re not helping .
and they even hur@@ t .
they worry about that we &apos;re getting worse there .
if something about what our society could allow people to make decisions so much to the communities in which people in which people would have dra@@ wn into little circum@@ stances , not only would not only improve people &apos;s lives , but we would be re@@ lie@@ ved .
econom@@ ists call this a par@@ e@@ to impro@@ v@@ ance of a par@@ e@@ to
income effects is going to make it all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are cho@@ king us .
gradu@@ ally , you read this carto@@ on , and you read this carto@@ on , and you say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ? &quot;
you don &apos;t know anything in this nu@@ cer@@ fish &apos;s whit@@ o@@ glass .
mis@@ de@@ dic@@ ated ima@@ gery , a shor@@ t-@@ si@@ zed view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came up with the idea that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that , if you break the gold fish glass , it &apos;s all possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they have paraly@@ sis .
if you break the gold fish glass , it &apos;s all possible , it &apos;s all the happiness , you lose happiness .
it &apos;s increasing the paraly@@ sis , and you lose happiness .
everybody needs a gold fishing glass .
this is almost limited to complete security -- possibly for the fish , definitely , for us .
but the ab@@ bo is from a metaph@@ or@@ ical gold@@ fish glass , it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for a mis@@ er@@ able , and , i guess , cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
thank you very much indeed .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects earlier about the human genome , and what that might mean , and through the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get away from digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new life .
and we &apos;ve always tried to ask big questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think a lot of bi@@ ologists tried to understand , and it &apos;s different levels of levels .
we &apos;ve been trying to do various approach@@ es to make it easier to the levels of the foot@@ prin@@ ts .
we have di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed for almost 20 years , and when we sequen@@ ced the human genome , the shif@@ ts of the anal@@ o@@ g world of biology to the digital world of computers .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can re@@ generate life , or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ las@@ ma &apos;s pal@@ dis@@ ium , who has the tin@@ i@@ est genome of a species that can repli@@ cate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do this with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes of the 500 or so that are here .
but if we look at this me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c map , which is very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s easy . but if we look at all these genes that we can elimin@@ ate one after the other , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some , in fact , to syn@@ thes@@ ize the chromo@@ that allows us to modi@@ fy the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to ask the question , can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some syn@@ thetic ?
does it allow the chemistry to generate these really big molecules , what has never been done before ?
and if we can , we can do that , can we start the chromo@@ some ?
a chromo@@ some is just a piece of chemical material , by the way , with a piece of chemical
our steps in terms of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life were exponenti@@ ally .
and our ability to write genetic code has been very slow , but it &apos;s been exp@@ and@@ ed , and our final point would now be put into an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
and so we started doing this 15 years ago .
it actually took a couple of years with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that dna syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zation is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more er@@ ror of the world happens .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and cor@@ rect the er@@ ror .
this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with digital information , the genom@@ ic ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus of the bacteria .
we made little pieces , made er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we first took this piece of chemical and into a bacteria , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code , and we made vi@@ ral particles .
the vi@@ ral particles then were rele@@ ased by the cells and came back , and they came back and killed e@@ . col@@ i .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were doing this model exactly .
they &apos;re laugh@@ ing more than you &apos;re doing it here .
this is how we think that this is a situation in the software , in the software , can actually build your hard@@ ware in a biological system .
but we wanted a lot further . we wanted to build an entire bacteri@@ al chromo@@ some , and it has more than 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it in a c@@ asse@@ ter from the size of the virus , what we could do , we could generate the size of the c@@ asse@@ t@@ board , to understand what the individual compon@@ ent of a living cell is .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re going to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information needs to be really mis@@ er@@ able .
when we first sequen@@ ced the genome early in 199@@ 5 , the er@@ ror rate was at a mistake per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
we found 30 mistakes in the distribution of 30 mistakes , and if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are about 50 letters long , and over@@ la@@ p with other 5@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to build smaller amo@@ unts of un@@ its to build smaller amo@@ unts of un@@ its so that they can fit together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built water@@ po@@ mp@@ s .
just think about it : we &apos;ve got a four@@ -@@ letter code : a , c , g and t .
tri@@ pl@@ y of these letters -- these letters co@@ ok about 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , and there &apos;s a single piece of detail for each of these amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
so we can use the genetic code in order to write our words , phr@@ ase , thoughts .
ini@@ tially , we were just sig@@ ned .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that it was not a poetry .
and we designed the pieces so that we could just break them with enzy@@ mes , and there are enzy@@ mes that re@@ pair this and put it back together .
and we started to make pieces , starting with sms the five and seven to seven thousand letters , put them together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to bring them back together , up to 7@@ 2,000 .
in each step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in circu@@ lation so that we can sequence them , because we tried to create a very rob@@ ust process , what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
and we tried to get to the point of auto@@ ma@@ tion .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball bil@@ yo@@ ff .
if we get to these very big st@@ ap@@ s -- over 100,000 base pa@@ irs -- then they &apos;re not just growing in e@@ . col@@ i , and it &apos;s going to be growing all the ways in e@@ . col@@ i , and that &apos;s how we evolved to other mechanis@@ ms .
we knew from a mechan@@ ism called the hom@@ o re@@ combin@@ ation , which uses biology to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces of these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organis@@ m called d@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ stors of the three million whe@@ el of radiation .
you see in the upp@@ er field , that his chromo@@ some will just fall apart .
12 to 24 hours later , again , everything has been fol@@ ded as it was .
and we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be di@@ stra@@ cted , but they can even live in vac@@ u@@ um .
i &apos;m absolutely safe that life can exist in space and can move , looking for a@@ qua@@ tic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of this out there .
here &apos;s a fine shot from the molecule that we made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve used only a grain mechan@@ ism with the right design of the pieces , we put it auto@@ matically , and then they put it auto@@ matically together .
this is not a electr@@ on microscop@@ e shot . it &apos;s a regular microscop@@ e shot .
it &apos;s such a big molecule , that we can even see it with the light microscop@@ e .
that &apos;s the foot@@ age of a six seconds of time .
this is the publi@@ cation that we &apos;ve just comple@@ ted recently .
these are over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters at the genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with an absolute structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we print it with a video of 10 and without any sub@@ stances , it would stre@@ tch up 14@@ 2 pages , just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we get a chromo@@ some ? how do we activ@@ ate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s so easier if you do it in eu@@ kar@@ y@@ on@@ ites like we are doing , you just take the nu@@ cle@@ us out and you give another one in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about the c@@ lon@@ y .
but in the arch@@ a@@ e@@ al bacteria , the chromo@@ some has been integr@@ ated into the cell , but only recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can take a full transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromo@@ som@@ e from one cell to another and to activ@@ ate this .
we inje@@ cted the chromo@@ some of a micro@@ species species . well , you know , these two things from each other as humans and mi@@ ce , and we gave some extra genes to choose this chromo@@ some , and we broke it with enzy@@ mes to destro@@ y all the proteins , and it was very amazing than we gave it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to esti@@ mate our very high graph@@ y graph@@ s here .
the new chromo@@ some would go into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there &apos;s the end , but we tried to get the process a little bit further .
this is the main mechan@@ ism of evolution here .
and we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromo@@ some , or a third of some , thousands of characteri@@ stics , in just one second , to a species add up to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene has changed that at a time , has been mis@@ sed a lot of biology .
there are enzy@@ mes of the restri@@ ction enzy@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna in fact .
the chromo@@ some in the cell was not one ; the chromo@@ som@@ es that we &apos;ve agre@@ ed to .
it was consi@@ stent in the cell , and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as a foreign material , and so we ended up with a cell with a new chromo@@ some .
it would destro@@ y the blue because of the genes that we had agre@@ ed .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteri@@ stics of species , and conver@@ ted completely into a new species on the new software that we gave into the cell .
and all the proteins changed the mem@@ bran@@ es to change -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we trans@@ fer@@ red .
it may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ ch@@ im@@ a , but we can imagine , by shif@@ ting the software dna , things quite dra@@ matically change .
now , i suggest@@ ed that this isn &apos;t the re@@ es@@ es@@ is -- is this based on 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve been suggest@@ ing that we might be able to create a new form of the cham@@ br@@ ani@@ an explosion in which there may be massive new species of agriculture based on this digital design .
so why should we do that ?
and i think it &apos;s quite obvious in terms of what we need .
we are growing up from si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
in order to put it in my context , i was born in 194@@ 6 .
today , there are three people on this planet for anyone who has been developed in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel , fuel , fuel for 6@@ .@@ 5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine to offer it .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 3@@ 0-@@ plus meters of oil , and that &apos;s a hundred million ver@@ ri@@ bles a day .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
and then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that &apos;s going to land in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our disco@@ ver@@ ies from all over the world , a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i &apos;d like to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electr@@ on@@ ary industry had a do@@ zen compon@@ ent , and look at the diversity of it .
well , we &apos;re enter@@ ing the limit@@ s of biological reality and the limit@@ s of the biological reality and the one of our imagination .
we now have technology today because of this fast syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zation method , to do what we call combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gene@@ tics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can produce millions of chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
if you &apos;re going to imagine these 20 million different genes , or optimi@@ zing these processes to make no@@ tan , or drug new vac@@ cin@@ es , we can change more molecular biology with just a small team than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s only a little bit more sele@@ ction , and we can sele@@ ct for living ability , production or fuel production vac@@ cin@@ es and so on .
this is a recor@@ ding of remarkable design software that we &apos;re working with , where you &apos;re actually designing and designing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly what the genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re going to focus on the fourth generation of the fourth generation now .
they &apos;ve seen cor@@ n to eth@@ ol eth@@ ol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have the number and the third generation of the two-@@ year and the third generation will be coming out of a much higher supply of sugar , such as oc@@ .@@ c. or different kinds of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but , as we think , the only way that we think about biology is a huge impact without another increase the cost of the cost of food , or the limit@@ ation of your avail@@ ability , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells as an ini@@ tial path@@ way material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are going to go from that path .
and we think that we &apos;re going to be the first thing with the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sun@@ light and co2 are a techni@@ que .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways of doing this .
this is an organis@@ m that we described in &apos; 9@@ 6 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a half and a half miles deep , with almost che@@ e@@ ky water temper@@ atures .
it trans@@ forms co2 in me@@ than@@ e by using hydro@@ gen as a source of the energy source .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use liquid co2 that could easily be placed to radiation , compare the co2 into fuel to en@@ force this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the basic questions of life .
you know , we really have -- moder@@ ant tar@@ gets , like the re@@ plac@@ ement of the entire pe@@ tro@@ chemical industry . so , if you could not do this at ted , wher@@ ever you could not do that at ted , where else ? a major source
but in the same way , we &apos;re working on using the same approach@@ es for the development of vac@@ cin@@ es .
you saw it with flu this year , we &apos;re always a year behind the ground , and we &apos;re going to have a dollar to a half when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
and i think this can be changed by making re@@ combin@@ ed vac@@ cin@@ es in front of the inside .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with change , can now be acceler@@ ated today with the evolution of evolution with syn@@ thetic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ es , and perhaps eu@@ car@@ y@@ on@@ ates .
we &apos;re going to improve light years from it from people , and our goal is just that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
and on the last ted conference , i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i promis@@ ed to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so , it &apos;s so far . and for all those who didn &apos;t have there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment that was ever done -- 27 kilometers in diam@@ e@@ ter .
his job is to create the conditions that exi@@ sted less than a billion second after the beginning of the universe , and that &apos;s up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just brea@@ th@@ ly ambi@@ tious .
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ e@@ ri@@ al .
we take pictures of these mini@@ -@@ big ban@@ gs in dete@@ c@@ tors .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing . it &apos;s called at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters in the distance , 22 meters in diam@@ e@@ ter .
here &apos;s a spec@@ tac@@ ular picture of the at@@ las in the structure so that you see the size of the size of the squ@@ ening .
on september the 10@@ th of september , the machine appe@@ ared for the first time .
and this is a picture taken by at@@ las .
it consi@@ der@@ ates huge je@@ sti@@ on in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first layer of radiation that goes back the entire distance around the l@@ h@@ c , and it would be re@@ je@@ cted with a part of the l@@ h@@ c to allow a rain from particles to the dete@@ ctor .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great tri@@ um@@ ph .
i don &apos;t know if this was caus@@ ing the biggest ju@@ g@@ cher , or this as someone went to the google side and saw the front page .
it means that we &apos;ve reach@@ ed an cultural influence next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wir@@ es here -- this golden dr@@ en@@ ar here .
these wir@@ es are provi@@ ding 13@@ -@@ thousand cou@@ ples when the machine is running on high-@@ performance .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do it . these are little wir@@ es . &quot;
you can afford that because if you free@@ ze them very far , you &apos;ll be called a super@@ conduc@@ tor .
so in min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , cool@@ er than the space between the stars , these wir@@ es can hold the ten@@ sion .
in one of the connections , between nin@@ e-@@ thousand magne@@ ts in the l@@ h@@ c , there was a commercial boo@@ k@@ ness .
so the wir@@ es re@@ duced even smaller and 13 thousand feet , suddenly electrical resi@@ stance , suddenly electrical resi@@ stance .
so this was the result .
now , this all is more amazing when you imagine that the mag@@ net wei@@ gh@@ s over 20 tons of wei@@ gh@@ s about 30 in@@ ches of time .
so , we destro@@ yed about 50 of the mag@@ net .
and they had to re@@ move what we were doing .
we identi@@ fied them , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ated them .
they &apos;re all going back to their way back .
by the end of mar@@ ch , the l@@ h@@ c will be func@@ tion@@ able again .
we &apos;re going to turn it down , and we expect to be able to do the first data at jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and we &apos;re going to get our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in some ways , in a way , the debate about the value of science and engineering of these fron@@ ts , it &apos;s easy to re@@ je@@ ct something .
and i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to capture the fact that we &apos;re doing beyond our limit@@ s , the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a chri@@ stian scientist , hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y da@@ vy , who , as i guess , when he &apos;s defen@@ sed the us@@ eless experiments of his teaching , his teaching was michael far@@ a@@ day , which said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the evolution of the human mind to assu@@ me that our scientific ideas are per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , that there are no myster@@ ies in nature , that there are no myster@@ ies in nature , and that there are no new worl@@ ds to be resol@@ ved . &quot;
thank you very much .
i &apos;m a no@@ ve@@ list .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s , of course , more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , ful@@ l-@@ long love and fascin@@ ation .
and i &apos;m not expe@@ cting anybody &apos;s going to change that .
but shor@@ t@@ less is a little bit more strange in my life and my career that led me to re@@ think my relationship to this work completely .
this strange event was that i was writing a book recently -- a bi@@ ograph@@ y called physi@@ trin@@ es , pra@@ y , love artists -- that , unlike all my previous books for some reason to the world , and a big me@@ ga@@ -@@ event , became international bor@@ s@@ ell@@ a &apos;s thing .
the result is that i , no matter where i come , i &apos;m being treated as if i was exten@@ ded at the bottom .
seriously -- bo@@ ther@@ ed up the bottom !
so , for example , they get to worry about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you worry you &apos;re never going to over@@ come that success ?
do you have a fear of writing your whole life and never create a book that would be interested in the world ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes it really coura@@ ge
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago , when i was a teenager , as a teenager told me that i wanted to be a publi@@ sh@@ er with the same kind of fear of fear .
people said , you don &apos;t worry , you never have succe@@ e to have succe@@ e@@ ded ?
do you have a fear of attra@@ cting your hu@@ mili@@ ation of a bl@@ um ? &quot;
don &apos;t you worry that you &apos;re going to leave your life for your life and never make it something and you &apos;re going to die on a fri@@ c@@ on , and you &apos;re going to die on a cru@@ m@@ al dream -- your mouth is filled with the bit@@ ter c@@ at of failure ?
you know , this is what you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , hon@@ est@@ y .
yeah , i &apos;m fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of all of these things .
and i used to do that .
and i &apos;m fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed more than more things that no one would be able to know .
like al@@ ga@@ e -- and other fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing things .
but , when it &apos;s writing about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this for a moment , why ?
is that rational , is that rational ?
is it logi@@ cal that by someone should be expected , that he has a fear of doing the work that he feels ?
and in fact , in terms of the creative enter@@ pris@@ es that they do not make us un@@ safe about the rema@@ ining mental state -- in a way that other professi@@ ons don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chem@@ ist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chem@@ ist when he asked if he was afraid to be a chem@@ ist to be a chem@@ ist .
with your chemical block , john -- how are you going to do this ?
it just wasn &apos;t that , you know , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemi@@ sts have not killed the repu@@ tation from the cent@@ u@@ ries of al@@ co@@ hol &apos;s in@@ san@@ e people .
but we have a writer to have this kind of repu@@ tor , but not only the wri@@ ters , but the crea@@ tives of all gene@@ ts , seem to have this repu@@ tation , to be ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
all you need to do is look at the bit@@ ter death numbers of really great minds alone from the 20th century alone from the 20th century , the young and often from their hands .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually require su@@ i@@ ci@@ des , they really had been su@@ red by their tal@@ ents of their
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er once said his death in his last interview : my books , each of my books , has killed me a little further .
it &apos;s an extraordinary stat@@ ement that you can do about your life .
but we &apos;re not even looking , when we listen to someone like this , because we &apos;ve known this kind of stat@@ ement for so long , and somehow we &apos;ve known the idea of this as so long , and collective accep@@ tan@@ ce , that creativity and suffering somehow comes together , and that art -- at the end -- always leads to the sou@@ th@@ th of the sou@@ l .
so the question i &apos;d like to show you today is : is this idea for you totally , is this real idea
do you feel like that ? because with just a centi@@ meter , i think -- i don &apos;t really feel with this notion .
and i find them ir@@ on@@ ably .
and i find them dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s done to the next century .
i find it better if we get to living our great creative obs@@ essi@@ ons .
and i &apos;m definitely sure that it &apos;s -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start to start this dark path of view , just in the context of view -- in the context that i &apos;m about to talk about my career right now .
that &apos;s -- look , i &apos;m just a young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years of work in my head .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m writing from now is being discus@@ sed by the world as the work of my lat@@ est book , right ? ?
and i &apos;m just saying it , because we &apos;re all sort of like all of these kids -- it &apos;s very likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jes@@ us , which is a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that anyone can get someone to go to 9 in the morning , to drink g@@ in . and i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d like to continue doing this work that i love .
and so the question is : how ?
after a while of refle@@ ctive , it seems to me that i should continue to write , to be able to continue to write a kind of a liter@@ al psych@@ ological initiative .
somehow , from now , i have to find a way of doing a safe distance between myself between me and my very natural interpretation of how the reaction is going to be the written .
as i &apos;ve been looking at models , i &apos;ve been looking for models in order to do that , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they &apos;ve had perhaps better or meaning@@ ful ideas about how we can help creative or meaning@@ ful ideas about how to help creative risks that are connected to creativity .
this was a se@@ arch@@ ing of me into the old gre@@ e@@ ce and the old ro@@ me .
please follow me , because the circle will be coming back again .
but in the ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ro@@ me , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of a di@@ v@@ ine di@@ ver &apos;s mind , which comes from a dist@@ ant , un@@ known source to the people -- of un@@ belie@@ vable , un@@ known reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks called these di@@ v@@ ine di@@ ving spi@@ ri@@ ts of creativity , physi@@ fic mon@@ um@@ es .
from so@@ da , he was known that he thought he &apos;d had a pen@@ a that was not sharing him from scrat@@ ch .
now , the roman@@ ms had the same idea , called this kind of body , sex@@ ually creative mind , a physi@@ cally auth@@ or .
this is great . the ro@@ cket didn &apos;t really think that a geni@@ us was a very clever individual .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this kind of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine nature , which meant that it literally lives in the walls of an artist &apos;s office -- something like do@@ bby , the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds -- that came out and the artists at work in a way that was a very invisible assi@@ stant and the out@@ come of work would be designing .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that i talked about -- the psych@@ ological constru@@ ct that is prote@@ cting you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artists of aging was appro@@ ved in terms of things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ is@@ s@@ m , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look anything for you , and everybody knew that you had this body &apos;s body geni@@ us that helped you .
when your work fle@@ w -- not the fau@@ lt your mistake , right ?
everybody knew , your geni@@ us was a little bit of a lau@@ ck@@ le .
so , in the west , people in the west really thought of creativity in the west .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was , let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no space for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures that assu@@ me orders from di@@ v@@ ine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and the people started to believe that creativity has never come from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people are listening to this or the artist , a geni@@ us -- instead of having a geni@@ us , instead of having a geni@@ us .
i have to tell you , i think this was a big mistake .
you know ? i think that i think that he thinks that he thinks that he thinks it &apos;s like the ves@@ sel@@ s , like the click and the essen@@ ce and the essen@@ ce and the source and the source of all the di@@ v@@ ine , creative myster@@ i@@ um is a little bit too much of a little bit of responsibility for a fra@@ gi@@ ble , human psy@@ che . &quot;
it &apos;s like asking someone to s@@ hr@@ ink the sun .
it &apos;s dis@@ rup@@ ted and di@@ stor@@ ted whole e@@ gos , and it creates all of these un@@ reach@@ able expec@@ tations to success .
i think that this prof@@ ession of success has er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated our artists in the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
so can we change it ?
perhaps to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the myster@@ y of the creative and myster@@ y .
maybe it &apos;s not .
maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate the fa@@ ke of a 500 years of rational human@@ ism just in an 18@@ -@@ minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this crowd who are really cele@@ br@@ ated by the very in@@ geni@@ ous scientific dou@@ bt about the notion of -- essentially -- fe@@ en people who follow people , and use the fe@@ eting magic on their projects and so on .
and i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i &apos;m going to leave up is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes it as much sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard , when it came to explain the absolutely in@@ spir@@ ing appe@@ ar@@ ity of the creative process .
a process that has -- as anyone knows , who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everyone here -- is , in other words , everybody here -- is not always reas@@ on@@ able
in fact , he can sometimes feel like par@@ an@@ or@@ as .
i had recently en@@ counter@@ ed this en@@ counter when i met the extraordinary american po@@ et ru@@ th stone , who was now over 90 , but she told me that when she grew up in the village virg@@ ini@@ a , she told me that she was working out on the street virg@@ ini@@ a , and she said she was going to feel like a po@@ em about the landscape on her , and she said she could feel like a po@@ em about the landscape on her
and she said it would be like a th@@ un@@ k of air .
it was going to clim@@ b over the country .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under your feet .
she knew that she could only do one such a moment , and that was -- in her words -- corpo@@ ra@@ tions like the de@@ vil , the de@@ vil .
she ran@@ ked like the de@@ vil to the house while she was followed by this po@@ em , and it was only about she had to do fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil , so she had to get it , and put it on the she@@ et and put it on the back .
in other pain@@ t@@ ings , she wasn &apos;t fast enough , and she ran and ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house , and the po@@ em roll@@ ed through them , and they did it . she said it would keep moving over the land and -- as she said , i was going to go to a different po@@ et , and -- as she said , i was looking at a different po@@ et .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget the part -- she said that there were moments of eyes in which they were almost adap@@ ted to .
so , she runs to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper , and she &apos;s driving through her , and the po@@ em is driving through her , and she &apos;s grab@@ bing a pen as it goes through her and then -- she said , it &apos;s like dig@@ ging her other hand and you can get it pac@@ k@@ ling it .
and they got the po@@ em on his tail , and he pulled it back into her body , and he took it on the she@@ et of paper .
and in those cases , the po@@ em came up and lost it on the paper -- but back@@ ward -- the last word for the first one .
now , when i heard this , i thought , it &apos;s aw@@ k@@ ward -- that &apos;s just the way my creative process is going on .
it &apos;s not exactly the way my creative process -- i &apos;m not the can@@ al .
i &apos;m a wall . in order to be able to stand up every day at the same time at the same time and s@@ ells me , and i &apos;m really un@@ comfortable and i &apos;m really embar@@ ras@@ sing .
but even in my high@@ way , i have this thing blo@@ wing this thing .
and i sus@@ pe@@ ct many of you have done that already .
even i had worked , or ideas that came through a source through me , which i really couldn &apos;t identify .
so what is this thing ?
and how do we get to losing this in relation without losing our minds , but in fact , in the contr@@ ary of mental health , we are going to keep ourselves in the opposite health ?
so to me , the best living example of how to do this , the musi@@ cian &apos;s tom wa@@ lin . i &apos;ve been allowed to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
and we talked about this top@@ ic , and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the late modern artists , who was trying to protect these un@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that lived in it and deliver them with them .
but then he got older and quie@@ t . he told me that he &apos;d spent one day on a high@@ way in los angeles , and that &apos;s where everything changed for him .
he was driving high speed when he suddenly heard a little frag@@ ment of a mel@@ o@@ dy , which is a lot of inspiration in inspiration , which is har@@ dly har@@ di@@ ble , and he wants it . she &apos;s very weal@@ i@@ ous . he leaves it , but he can &apos;t touch it , but he can &apos;t touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen@@ cil , he doesn &apos;t have a c@@ asse@@ tte record .
so he &apos;s beginning to clim@@ b these ancient wir@@ es , like , for example , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be tra@@ cked by this song at a time .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not making it .
but instead of looking at p@@ ani@@ r , he just stopped listening .
he ended up the whole article , and he did something entirely new .
and he just looked into the hea@@ v@@ ens and said , hon@@ est@@ y , can you see that i &apos;m driving a car ?
am i , like , i could write a song like i could write a song ?
if you really want to do , come back to a less che@@ aper moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , there &apos;s someone else &apos;s time .
go and sk@@ ill@@ le leon@@ ard co@@ hen .
his whole process of work has changed after this .
it &apos;s not the work itself . it was still as dark as e@@ b and ever .
but the process and the heavy measu@@ re@@ ment that surro@@ unded it was that when he took the geni@@ us out of it , where he caused nothing as trouble , and left it back there , he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be a repres@@ ent@@ able , quie@@ t thing .
there could be a horri@@ fic , wonderful , bizar@@ re collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the strange , immedi@@ ate thing , which was not entirely a piece of tom .
when i heard this story , it changed a little bit of the way i worked , and it had res@@ cu@@ ed me .
now , this idea was saved me as i was in the middle of wis@@ fast , pra@@ y , love , and i was feeling in one of these ri@@ bs of dou@@ bt that we all fall in , when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you started to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . it &apos;s going to be the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
and i started thinking , i should just come up with this project .
but then i remem@@ ber@@ ed how tom had spo@@ ken in the free sky , and i was trying to do it .
so , i pulled my view from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt , and i was talking about my comm@@ ent@@ ary towards a blan@@ k corner of the room .
i was talking about : you know , ner@@ ve , you and i know both , you and i know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not complete my fau@@ lt , right ?
because you know , i invest everything i &apos;ve got invest@@ ed . i don &apos;t have anymore anymore than that .
so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to give up here , and keep your advantage of it .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the he@@ ck with that .
i &apos;m not going to write further , because that &apos;s my job .
and i &apos;d like to give sym@@ ph@@ l that i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the jobs today .
because ... in the end , it &apos;s like follo@@ ws , cent@@ u@@ ries of cent@@ u@@ ries in the deser@@ ts of north africa , people have gather@@ ed people to mon@@ ths with sac@@ red dan@@ cers and music that have been stopped for hours -- until to the da@@ wn of the morning .
these rich@@ est were always great , because the dan@@ cers were profession@@ ally , and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , very rare , something special happened . one of the perfor@@ r@@ ors actually became sub@@ scen@@ dent .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you all have seen some performance in your life once of your life .
it was as if the time was going to stand up and hit the dan@@ cers through a kind of p@@ lo@@ te . he didn &apos;t do anything else than he ever did -- 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything po@@ im@@ ed together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t seem to get human in human ways .
he was sho@@ ot@@ ed by the inside , and he was sho@@ ot@@ ing by the bottom , and everything grab@@ bed through a di@@ v@@ ine fire .
when this happened then , people knew what that was . they called it with his name .
they put the hands together and started sing@@ ing : eric al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting histor@@ ical foot@@ age : when the mo@@ ws took south sp@@ in , they brought it with this practice , and the language changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries of angel@@ al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h &apos;s fan@@ cy physi@@ gue , bir@@ ti , ol@@ am chri@@ sti@@ ans , which you &apos;re still hearing at fri@@ w@@ ling and flo@@ wing fl@@ am@@ en@@ ar dan@@ cers .
when a perfor@@ ner in spa@@ in in spa@@ in has done something more ma@@ gical : classi@@ al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ am , ol@@ am , al@@ la@@ h , great , bra@@ y , great , bra@@ y , it &apos;s kind of a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but , the pi@@ cky part followed the next morning , when the dan@@ cers was@@ h itself and reali@@ zes that it &apos;s 11 in a tu@@ es@@ day -- and he &apos;s no longer wearing a meter of god in his own .
he &apos;s only an aging mortality with pain@@ ful k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe it &apos;s never going to go back to these hei@@ ghts again .
and maybe anyone will ever call god &apos;s name , and then what should he do with the rest of his life , and what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ings of creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of p@@ ure , if you didn &apos;t believe from the very beginning , the most extraordinary aspe@@ cts of your existence has come from them .
if you just believe that you &apos;re a com@@ pres@@ sed -- from an im@@ ei@@ vable source of a kind of uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source for your life , when you &apos;re done with someone else , when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about this , it changes all of that changes .
and so i started thinking , and so i think of security in the past few months , while i worked on the book that &apos;s going to seem to seem -- as the dangerous , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , very expected , very expected offi@@ ci@@ als of my ch@@ ie@@ f success .
what i need to say constantly when i &apos;m going to tell you about it , is , don &apos;t worry about it .
be not de@@ cou@@ ger@@ ated .
just just do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribu@@ tion to your contribu@@ tion , whatever he is .
if your job is dan@@ cing , tan@@ cing .
now , if the du@@ de di@@ v@@ ine geni@@ us that you &apos;ve done on the site , for a very short moment , a little bit of wonder of your effort , then , eric , classi@@ c !
and if it isn &apos;t , dance still , your dance .
and doctor ! hon@@ est@@ ly , for all of you .
and i think that , and i feel that we should teach it .
mammo@@ ol@@ ne ! in spi@@ te of all of you , just for all of this , you just have your own love and your sense of being there .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
ol@@ é !
last year , i &apos;ve shown these two sli@@ des to illu@@ strate that the arc@@ tic ice ap@@ e , which has been the size of the bottom 4@@ 8 states , which had the size of the bottom 4@@ 8 states , has dec@@ lin@@ ed by 40 percent .
but that doesn &apos;t seem strong enough to be the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of ice .
in a sense , the arc@@ tic ice ice re@@ ef@@ s is the be@@ eting heart of our global climate system .
it gro@@ ws in the winter and s@@ hr@@ as@@ sin@@ ates in the summer .
so the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a ti@@ me@@ -@@ lap@@ se picture of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the perman@@ ent ice ice is mar@@ ked with red .
as you can see , it gro@@ ws on the dark blue , this is the an@@ nu@@ al ice ice in the winter , and it &apos;s s@@ hr@@ as@@ king in the summer .
it &apos;s called perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which goes out of the body .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to disappe@@ ar from here to here .
this is a problem , because the warming is the fro@@ zen reason to clim@@ b the arc@@ tic ocean , where there are large quanti@@ ties of che@@ aper carbon , which is , when it &apos;s attac@@ king , from micro@@ bes to me@@ than@@ e , too to me@@ than@@ e .
compared to the entire amount of climate change in the atmosphere , it could double the size of climate change in the atmosphere , and it could double that amount of critical point .
already today , in some flat levels of al@@ as@@ ka in al@@ as@@ ka , they &apos;re com@@ pres@@ sed from itself from the water .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter at the university of al@@ as@@ ka , he &apos;s travel@@ ed with another c@@ up of la@@ ke in the past winter of the past winter .
who@@ a !
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will it get us out .
and one reason is , this enormous bar@@ re@@ l heat dri@@ ves up green@@ land from the north .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al drop of water .
but the volu@@ me are signific@@ antly more than ever before .
this is the can@@ ger@@ y pi@@ le river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know the sea level through land ice mel@@ ts , here &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the sea .
these ri@@ vers are just going to take it up .
on the other end of the planet , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the largest ice mass on the planet .
and last month , researchers repor@@ ted that the entire continent has now been a negative ic@@ ec@@ raft .
and the western ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which is blo@@ wn over a couple of under@@ sea is@@ lands , is very hea@@ vi@@ ly .
this is 20 feet of sea al@@ titude , as green@@ land .
in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , the third largest ic@@ a mass , you see the top new la@@ kes that were gl@@ aci@@ ers a couple of years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from this cru@@ mel@@ ine water .
in the front of this gl@@ aci@@ er , this gl@@ aci@@ er is the drin@@ king water .
the water levels have radi@@ cally exp@@ and@@ ed .
but when they &apos;re con@@ stra@@ ined , the majority of drin@@ king water is also going away .
in california , there was a 40 percent redu@@ ction of the s@@ ca cei@@ ling of the si@@ er@@ ra .
this is what dri@@ ves the stor@@ age .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read them , are serious .
this op@@ ra@@ il all over the world leads to a dra@@ matic increase to fire .
and the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es all over the world have never been consi@@ stent in a really convin@@ cing inci@@ dence , and before it has never been consi@@ stent .
four times so many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 years .
this is an absolutely un@@ sustainable development pattern .
if you look at this in the histor@@ ical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve got 70 million tons of co2 produced all 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons per day into the oceans .
if you look at the area of the eastern pacific area , the american continent and the largest sub@@ ur@@ ger@@ ation , where there &apos;s a dra@@ matic dec@@ line of oxygen in the oceans .
the largest single factor for global warming , bes@@ i@@ des de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which causes 20 percent , is burning by fossil fu@@ els .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest cont@@ acts , together with china .
and the sugge@@ sti@@ on was to build a lot of other can@@ cers .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
so here are the ones that have been stab@@ bed in the last few years , with some green alterna@@ tives that have been pro@@ posed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the coal rates and oil repor@@ ts have spent a quar@@ ter-@@ billion dollar year last cold year to pro@@ mote clean coal , which is a con@@ tradi@@ ction in itself .
this picture remin@@ ded me of something .
around christ@@ mas , at home , with me at ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion tons of cooking bul@@ bs out .
and they just looked at it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the second year of america &apos;s largest waste .
this was about christ@@ mas &apos;s .
one of the commer@@ ci@@ als of cooking business was this one .
sil@@ ence of the carbon is a happy , happy bur@@ ker .
it &apos;s in the kitchen and the pay@@ s in america , and he &apos;s helping our economy to grow .
lu@@ sty , the carbon becomes cle@@ aner cle@@ aner every day .
it &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and aff@@ ord@@ able , and labor@@ ers stay in the train and bread .
this is the source of most char@@ coal in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
the most powerful mountain wor@@ ker is the la@@ d@@ der of mas@@ sey tissue .
let me tell you very clearly . al gore , nan@@ cy p@@ el@@ o@@ s@@ i , har@@ ry rei@@ d , they don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so , the alli@@ ance for climate protection has created two campaig@@ ning campaig@@ ns .
this is one , a part of her .
in the co@@ al@@ er@@ g@@ y , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
and so we set up the top stage to spend a significant amount of money to get an adverti@@ sing on the way to get the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not dir@@ t@@ ful .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it sm@@ ells still well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s get a little bit of that .
clean char@@ coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so , let &apos;s do a tour of this modern , clean co@@ b@@ le@@ factory factory .
fantastic ! this machine is kind of l@@ oud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean co@@ bs of coal .
and yet , the coal bur@@ ns of one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here changes here , changes everything .
take a look at it , this is the current , clean coal technology .
and finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security is em@@ bed@@ ded .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thre@@ ad that conne@@ cts them all together is our depen@@ dence on carb@@ on-@@ based power such as in@@ expensive coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a coura@@ ge@@ ous , new solution to free us from this mis@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion situation .
america has new percent cle@@ aner electricity , within the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
it &apos;s a plan to get america back to work , to make us safe and to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
don@@ ation america is new . find more .
so this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a new care of america .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways , our depen@@ dence on old , dir@@ ty fuel that is breaking our world to reduce .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new invest@@ ments in order to create well-@@ paid jobs .
support america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be very quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to get a long time , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you very much .
i &apos;d like to start by asking you to think about the time of your childhood , when they play with blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts .
and as they realized how to stre@@ tch the hands and match the hand , they take the sound and moving and moving , they actually learned and to solve the problems of shif@@ ting the way that they understood and to solve the way of shif@@ ting shif@@ ts .
the spa@@ tial thinking is very clo@@ sely connected to how we understand a lot of our surro@@ und@@ ings .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way we interact with real objects -- along with my exper@@ t pat@@ ana and my collea@@ gue je@@ ev@@ an kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i , i started to wonder : what if we were going to use computers , instead of a mouse pres@@ identi@@ al , that moves like a digital finger@@ on that moves like a digital finger@@ on on a flat piece of paper -- what if we could interven@@ e with both hands and interven@@ e to do it , how do we want them to do it ?
the question was so pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly that we started to explore the answer and we started to develop them .
in short , a si@@ t@@ able computer is a inter@@ active computer in the size of a swe@@ et .
you can move on your hand , you can percei@@ ve each other , you can pick up your mov@@ ements , and you have a screen and a prin@@ ting tra@@ je@@ c@@ ty .
more importantly : are physi@@ cally , so you can only move them like circu@@ its just by making your hands and contribu@@ tions .
and the si@@ z@@ ine ones are an example of a new generation of use to manipu@@ late digital data .
and if these tools become more physical and a conscious awareness of their mov@@ ements , recogni@@ zing each other , and look at each other , we can begin to see new and entertain@@ ing inter@@ actions with them , then we can start to explore new and entertain@@ ing inter@@ actions .
so i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this gap is con@@ fir@@ med for the video re@@ view , and if i put it in a direction , the video &apos;s going to play forward , and if i put it into the other direction , it goes back@@ wards .
and these inter@@ active portra@@ its take each other in each other .
so , when i play them by side , that &apos;s what interests interest .
if you &apos;re surro@@ unded by the ones , you &apos;ll find that , and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their mov@@ ements and no@@ vel@@ ation as well .
one of the interesting con@@ sequence of inter@@ actions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gest@@ ures on data , how to honor colors like this with li@@ qui@@ di@@ gene@@ ts .
in this case , we &apos;ve con@@ fir@@ med three bran@@ ches as a grain of paint , and i can use them to po@@ ur paint in the middle of the middle , and then they &apos;re mix@@ ed .
if we over@@ lay it , we can just get back a little bit back .
there are also some nice opportunities in education as languages , or mathematics or more flexi@@ ble , where we &apos;re going to give people the ability to get the chance of fast and see the results at the same time .
here i am -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i conver@@ t , which i built with a simple equ@@ ation program .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mix@@ ture of sc@@ rab@@ ble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
basically , you get each other on every si@@ c@@ able rand@@ om@@ ly promis@@ ed letters , and while you &apos;re trying to educ@@ ate words , they will be te@@ sted about a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mix@@ ed again , and you &apos;ve got a new letter combin@@ ation and you have new opportunities to
thank you very much .
these are some of the kids who came to a trip to the media lab , and i was able to try them to try and try a video of it , and i took a video of it .
and they really loved it .
one interesting thing about this kind of appli@@ cations is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of in@@ struc@@ tions .
all you have to say is , &quot; educ@@ ated words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are some of the people who are testing it .
this is our yo@@ un@@ gest r@@ est on the bottom right there .
and it turns out that he wanted to just st@@ ack the si@@ ghts .
so , for him , they were just cont@@ amin@@ ating .
this is a inter@@ active tri@@ ck@@ phone .
we wanted to develop an edu@@ cational learning learning for language learning .
so this is fe@@ li@@ x .
he can bring new characters into the scene by reve@@ aling the tex@@ ture of the table that shows this figure .
here he is pul@@ ling the sun up .
the sun goes up .
now he &apos;s putting a tra@@ ctor in the scene now .
the orange tra@@ ctor .
good work ! yes !
by sha@@ king the si@@ z@@ ine , and it allows them to interact with each other , he can interact
... his own story is inv@@ enting .
hell@@ o , hey !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and he can deter@@ mine how it &apos;s developed .
flying c@@ at .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today is to show it a music project for live fil@@ es that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the si@@ t@@ ance as a sound , like leadership , b@@ ass and pu@@ pp@@ y and pu@@ pp@@ y .
each one has four different vari@@ ations ; you can sele@@ ct you to be able to use
and you can stor@@ e these sounds into the sequence that you can do in any patter@@ her@@ able patter@@ cles .
and you &apos;re pul@@ ling them by just taking a ton of dou@@ ble@@ -@@ si@@ t@@ able to a sequence of a sequence .
and there are effects that you can change live , like room and filter .
you connect it with a particular note , and then you &apos;ll be able to put it up .
and then there &apos;s more sophisti@@ cated effects like p@@ .@@ a. and the sounds that you &apos;re using on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s take a look .
and we begin by putting the leadership &apos;s voice into two cent@@ ric si@@ tan@@ ty , and this one in a series , exp@@ and , exp@@ and , exp@@ and@@ ing them and add a little more of the voice .
now i &apos;m going to add a b@@ ass .
now i &apos;m going to do a little bit of plan@@ ts with this .
and i &apos;m now pul@@ ining the fil@@ ters with the fla@@ y so i can control the effect of the same .
i can speed up the whole sequence by getting the p@@ ace into one direction or another , ki@@ p .
and now i &apos;m going to put the cli@@ f on the b@@ ass , for a little bit more expression .
i can turn the sequence while they &apos;re going to go out .
and by doing this , i don &apos;t have to plan them in the board , but it can impro@@ v@@ ise , and it can impro@@ v@@ ise , it &apos;s going to be coun@@ ted .
and finally , i can conclu@@ de the whole sequence of appl@@ ying the l@@ ength of the sound to the left , to the left .
thank you very much .
so , as you can see , my obs@@ ession is to develop new human computer interface that makes better to the way our brains work and bodies work .
and today , i had time to share with you a part of this new design world and some of the ways that we &apos;re working on our lab .
so the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you on the way , is that we are on the cei@@ ling to interact with this new generation of interven@@ tions to interact with digital media , to bring information into our world that will cause our dem@@ ands .
thank you very much .
and i &apos;m looking forward with you all the time .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
and i &apos;m very excited that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what &apos;s going to be bio@@ ha@@ cking ?
i have to just go out a little bit , and that &apos;s what bio@@ ha@@ cking was about with the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing a couple of years now with bio@@ ha@@ cking , and i &apos;ve started this , because i just wanted to know and do it , and i wanted to do it most of all , what i &apos;ve learned in terms of thinking about math .
so , that was my primary motiv@@ ator .
so , it was a curi@@ osity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of the matter , like this .
i think the molecular biology generally , in general now , is talking about , biot@@ echn@@ ology , everything you count , syn@@ thetic biology and so on .
extremely importantly , it &apos;s extremely important now , and even a lot of , much more important is going to become in the future .
there are so compar@@ able things like all these phenomen@@ ally engine@@ ered plants on the stor@@ es .
now , there &apos;s cra@@ ig vent@@ er now , who &apos;s trying to make bio@@ po@@ q , so gas from al@@ ga@@ e .
and yet , there are some things that are totally present in the daily day , which most of us are not aware of , for example , was@@ h enzy@@ mes that allow us to was@@ h us to was@@ h four degrees , are also phenomen@@ ori@@ cally optimi@@ zed enzy@@ mes .
and the list , you can continue to continue off .
and so from the interest of this technology , i &apos;ve just continu@@ ed to get on the way .
so , what &apos;s why ha@@ cking about now ?
most of the people know this from the software sector .
so computers ha@@ cking , and then in the media , it &apos;s always going to break in the media , and he &apos;s going to break up the bu@@ ck@@ ers somewhere and cla@@ ve data and so
it &apos;s kind of sad for the ha@@ ck@@ case scene very sad , because it doesn &apos;t matter what they actually started like this , and what &apos;s really been behind .
in fact , the software ha@@ ck@@ ers , in the &apos; 7@@ 0s , started with computer cli@@ ps , and it &apos;s been invented the internet , and it &apos;s been invented the internet .
and it &apos;s about doing a play@@ ful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and problem , this is not just a technologi@@ cal problem , it can also be a socie@@ tal problem , it can also be a problem problem , which is just a problem , so that &apos;s a fair problem , so that it &apos;s a matter of a question , and how can you do that , or how can you do it better .
and it just became huge with software , but there &apos;s also the electr@@ on@@ ics in electr@@ on@@ ics , there &apos;s also a whole buil@@ der scene that would do with electr@@ on@@ ics all kinds of things .
and now , in biology , i would like to leave this metaphor that comes from syn@@ thetic biology , take out that biology is actually a kind of information science , because , the d.@@ n@@ .@@ a-@@ code is an abstra@@ ct code , which is , yes , it &apos;s not exactly the same way computers , because it &apos;s critical because it &apos;s a matter of matter , it &apos;s real matter , and it &apos;s not just cy@@ ber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also co@@ ok it , so , i find it ha@@ cking , so i found it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to clim@@ b a lot deeper with it .
and that actually took only two thousand eight sense of shape , these networks .
there &apos;s ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a do@@ t or@@ g , which is origin@@ ally from swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , which is with europe and with a co@@ operation in india , but it &apos;s now community , or active people everywhere in the world .
now , these are a more arti@@ stic ex@@ ecu@@ tions , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosop@@ her@@ s , and in collaboration with scientists , and working with scientists to engage with these technologies and ask questions and to process crea@@ tively , there &apos;s libr@@ aries of museum , and yes , everything else .
but it &apos;s really always about finding such a ligh@@ t@@ less access to this kind of thing , having to have a play@@ ful effort with this .
and then there &apos;s do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ addi@@ tional bi@@ o do@@ t or@@ g , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ bi@@ o .
this is from the united states a network , which is actually a kind of for@@ um where you &apos;re looking at and talking online and discus@@ sing online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technologi@@ cal and a little bit of business on the ground , so they &apos;re going to ask it , so that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be asked , yes .
and from those networks that have made all the popular popular , there &apos;s a scene that i want to re@@ f@@ use to try to portra@@ re@@ cate .
here in the slide on the top on the top , you see bio@@ log@@ es , which is a ha@@ cker@@ space , so basically a kind of school , a private school , non@@ profit , a facili@@ ty where everybody can get there .
children , old , all sorts of people go there to just engage with them , they have a lab , and look at a lab , and look at what can you do if these labor@@ ec@@ es are .
on the left on the bottom , there &apos;s a group in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia called house cre@@ ator , which is called the fact that there &apos;s been a pretty long time ago .
ever more than these two networks .
they &apos;re also involved in such an arti@@ stic aspe@@ ct of biological materials , and , yes , electr@@ on@@ ics , and they &apos;re combin@@ ing it in a very different way of doing it .
a group from the ag@@ ar@@ a that i met before a while ago , which is a stud@@ ent@@ ary group who would like to do the public to tell more of what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve made them so on on the street , and they &apos;re trying to explain what d.@@ n@@ .@@ a is .
and i was at the other picture on the other picture a lec@@ ture in cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen in the medical museum with an exhi@@ bi@@ tion for a show .
and that &apos;s , yes , it &apos;s just quite young people , but the only thing that &apos;s really contribu@@ ted to all of us is this fascin@@ ation of technology .
and what you can do with it and you &apos;re also quite concerned about the society and say , &quot; okay , what do you know , what do you want to do , have you been interested in doing this ?
so , o@@ .@@ k , now , to ha@@ ck biology , you need some materials .
you need biological materials , you need biological materials , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a laboratory .
the other thing that you normally understand under a lab , which is so sort of cra@@ wer@@ ed machines , extremely expensive , extremely di@@ t@@ ched , just for profession@@ als , trained acade@@ mi@@ sts with ph@@ .@@ d. and so on .
and our approach was just saying , okay , okay , that &apos;s not what you don &apos;t need to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary , because each coffee engine is actually more sophisti@@ cated technology than most of the lab devices , it &apos;s really like that .
and with this pre@@ mis@@ e with this pre@@ mis@@ e with this pre@@ mis@@ e , for example , brian de@@ g@@ ger in england attemp@@ t to put up a minim@@ um ben@@ ch , then took a heat band , a hot pla@@ te , and , yes , this is the nor@@ dar@@ ar brothers , and it &apos;s grown bacteria , and it &apos;s grown bacteria
so anyone who has been colle@@ cted a sou@@ p of sou@@ p that he has left too long , and he &apos;s done before .
i then tried to go home in my lab in my lab to do a little bit , and then i cho@@ se to pur@@ ch@@ ase a little bit of calcul@@ ating power behaviors on e@@ bay and try to do a little d.@@ n@@ .@@ a analysis , and i tried to do it back in my home like this as dr. d.@@ .@@ a &apos;s
now , this shouldn &apos;t be a jo@@ ke yet , but it shouldn &apos;t be a jo@@ ke .
down here in the bottom of this picture , you see the lab , in terms of leadership , so that &apos;s such an in@@ formed garage with all kinds of labor@@ on@@ es that universi@@ fied to college , a group in paris , who has been through what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s quite successful , and it &apos;s doing a little bit of interesting things , so i &apos;m going to do a little bit of a project .
and this is bio@@ log@@ y , which is , again , ha@@ ck@@ space , this , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of , sort of like molecular biology , in fact , for molecular biology .
and yeah , you can see , it &apos;s relatively , very cor@@ rect , so that there are people working in their home , up to big , so far to big organizations that are keeping more and more and more in institu@@ tional form , which is keeping more of us in institu@@ tion@@ alized form .
but always , the idea is that it should be just going to be just going and acc@@ essi@@ ble .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as a international group when we &apos;ve been aware of ourselves , ok . so we &apos;re now here as a real scene here , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who are always ch@@ at@@ ting and so on .
and then it came from the do@@ -@@ up bi@@ o or@@ g website of the fo@@ under , and we said yes , we have to really meet ourselves now , and we &apos;ve got real meetings , and we &apos;ve developed two types of shows , one in london , two thousand 10 , and shor@@ tly to the united states , in san francisco .
and , you know , there was it , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to tell , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values , and what are our goals , and what are our target ?
and that &apos;s where we created a co@@ de of a co@@ ordin@@ ation .
and it was pretty intui@@ tive , so everyone just got his wi@@ sh@@ es , his and what moves him , and then it would be expres@@ sed , then .
and it came out , i think , a very good code to do .
and we don &apos;t have that com@@ pla@@ in@@ t@@ able , but that &apos;s , i think , i think , pretty well , i think , quite well , people are quite convinced about this .
and we actually tried to bring that back into the acade@@ mic world , but there &apos;s somehow not that that &apos;s going to happen .
so i think we &apos;re in the bio@@ ha@@ ble scene , in which , even one step further than the acade@@ mi@@ an world .
yeah , what kind of world do we do right now ?
one project that i made with the ha@@ ck@@ teri@@ a network in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land was that we wanted to collapse something called the op@@ tical tra@@ pp@@ er or op@@ tical p@@ lot .
that &apos;s when you focus a las@@ er be@@ am , in one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , and then move in that focus , so that &apos;s kind of like a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory of tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory in principle .
it really works , this is going to be in acade@@ mi@@ an , and we thought , o@@ .@@ k , we may be able to get a web@@ c@@ am , put up the l@@ ens , put the l@@ ens off , turn the l@@ ens , turn the l@@ ens , and then you have a microscop@@ e , which is going to acceler@@ ate about a quar@@ e of a thousand times .
this is what you see down there .
and then we pulled off a d.@@ v@@ .@@ d str@@ yer , and hung the str@@ ands off the las@@ er , and then we tried to focus on this camera .
and that &apos;s unfortunately not done , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it in that .
another project , which is from the french group there from paris , and that &apos;s done , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and in fact , he &apos;s got such a brain wave , such as e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g or something , so e@@ .@@ e@@ .@@ g , has been concerned with neuro@@ biology , his ni@@ ck@@ name is sam neuro@@ ha@@ ck .
he then came up with this hel@@ met of this hel@@ met , and in the co@@ operation with the museum , that &apos;s where it came .
and then the vis@@ it@@ ors could go in the room , put it on this chair , put this hel@@ met up .
then their brain waves were measu@@ red , and depen@@ ding on what they thought , or how you thought , is there &apos;s a different lights in the room .
it was a pretty fan@@ cy project .
another thing from the united states , which has just been with this long-@@ time story , is that p@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ r , that &apos;s the c@@ .@@ c@@ .@@ player , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about cop@@ ying genes , modi@@ fying , re@@ duc@@ ing , d.@@ n@@ .@@ a , frag@@ ments , so that you can make it visible .
so if i do this now , the pro@@ fil@@ ator in the crime , go down there , collect some heat sam@@ ples , and then they do this , and then they do this , and then you can say , &quot; okay , this hair bel@@ on@@ gs to this guy , like that .
and the machines that do this , they &apos;re pretty expensive to buy commer@@ ci@@ als , the che@@ ap@@ est b@@ elt , the che@@ ap@@ est b@@ elt that will go on to four thousand euro@@ s .
and that &apos;s not in the ho@@ b@@ by@@ -@@ section , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot of a lot
so that &apos;s just one app@@ lic@@ ation of a lot of you can do with this .
and they came up with two two buil@@ ders , and they said , &quot; okay , we make easier and che@@ aper , and then we &apos;ve got open-@@ source , and then we &apos;ve got open source , so free , free hard@@ ware , electr@@ on@@ ics , that this device &apos;s up , and are now the che@@ ap@@ est cure of these devices in the world , and are now the che@@ ap@@ est cure of these devices around the world .
i think that somehow like six thousand dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly in a frame where it becomes so much more available .
so , i think i think it &apos;s a very anno@@ ying ha@@ ck .
and one project that i started started to build was a gene gun .
gen@@ -@@ gun , yeah , like this sort of air prin@@ ting bat , which sho@@ ot something far , two in@@ ches or something .
you put out the n@@ .@@ a. on gold particles , and the gold particles would go into these air prin@@ t@@ tops , and then i &apos;d sna@@ ve that on a woo@@ k , and then i would put it up to the same thing that was going on .
so the device that you see there , it didn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s my prototyp@@ e , but that &apos;s my prototyp@@ e , and that &apos;s kind of like a bran@@ ch , so on the screen , the thing on , electr@@ on@@ ics , put up , and that was the pressure , and that was the point , but the thing was broken , the thing was broken
and then i took a sa@@ il pad and made it atta@@ ched to it .
a gu@@ ar , if you have the full power with water , has a lot of pressure , so i think there &apos;s a lot of thousands of wei@@ gh@@ al@@ ous wei@@ gh@@ es about it .
and then you can acceler@@ ate the particles strong enough , and then you go into the stal@@ k .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euro@@ s or something , or something , seas@@ on is about the fif@@ th .
so , it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically useful .
and so that &apos;s right now , the core concern@@ s of the scene is to increase this avail@@ ability of technology , and also increase the information and the understanding and the understanding of understanding that more people can be enga@@ ged .
because , as at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little know@@ know@@ s of that , and there &apos;s no way to make it really good to form .
because , if you just read about it , in terms of sen@@ ior liter@@ ature , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve done it yourself .
and i think that technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be able to meet useful people in society , you want to be able to meet useful decisions in society and talk to technology , you need to access access to knowledge and to technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it and understand it .
and that then runs open and open through the prin@@ ts open and citi@@ zen science .
so , as a citi@@ zen , as citizens , as citizens , are being atta@@ ched to these scientific technologies as well .
and this is the core concern@@ s of the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers .
these are the people who are at least sla@@ ving offi@@ cially on the website , d.@@ i@@ .@@ y@@ .@@ biological dom@@ -@@ d@@ ot@@ -@@ or@@ g website .
that &apos;s already a very remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also repres@@ ent@@ ed in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
that &apos;s what i think are there are fewer people being put in than actually exi@@ sting .
so i know of some of you who haven &apos;t been involved with .
and these are just the bio@@ ha@@ ck@@ ers , the individual people .
and in part , with these ha@@ ck@@ ings , they also put these places together together .
and that &apos;s the beginning of the beginning .
as i said , two thousand years ago , it &apos;s just started .
and ha@@ ck@@ ings , which is the computer ha@@ ck@@ road , because the c@@ up base in ber@@ lin was the first , 95 hundred thousand chance of nin@@ e-@@ five chance
and this is now a gigan@@ tic network of very good , yes , infrastructure centers , which have become repres@@ ented all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to exp@@ and as well as well , and then we &apos;re also similar connected , so that there &apos;s also more connected to people who can be enga@@ ged .
and i would invi@@ te each once to cop@@ e with this and also try to do something else .
it &apos;s not that easy now , but it &apos;s not so easy , and it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curi@@ osity , and you get enough energy in it , you &apos;re going to get there .
thank you very much for listening .
so that &apos;s it .
yes , hell@@ o .
how do we do people actually work ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moving me as a designer , but also in the field of research , and in the field of business , and in the field of user , and in the field of user .
it &apos;s about how to get people in inter@@ active media , so that they can use these inter@@ active media , and to create them a way of a satis@@ fying experience .
and i believe that the inter@@ active media in us are going to address arch@@ a@@ c , cognitive models , so the patterns that have been progra@@ mm@@ ed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can just re@@ store that through inter@@ active media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually think that this high-@@ tech technology that you &apos;re showing that you actually get to the future , but in fact , it is that the future is right in us , in our arch@@ a@@ ian roots .
now , what are arch@@ a@@ an models now ?
i &apos;ve been writing four words , and i &apos;d like to explain to you brie@@ fly .
too arch@@ a@@ ic cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve been doing in the pre-@@ industrial times .
well , to these arch@@ a@@ ic models , we have basically naturally natural propor@@ tions to virtu@@ ality .
this sounds the most unusual thing .
but i &apos;m going to conclu@@ de , but i &apos;m going to show you an experiment , and i &apos;m going to show you that you have a natural relationship to virtu@@ ality .
the second thing is that we &apos;ve been able to talk about this arch@@ a@@ an model very , very , very , very , very ima@@ d , even though we &apos;re using a co@@ di@@ di@@ zed language today .
and the third part , it &apos;s actually expla@@ ining itself .
we all know that the inter@@ active media comes from definition non@@ lin@@ ear , which affec@@ ts the causes of lin@@ ear@@ ity , and what we &apos;re saying , of course , is that we feel the lin@@ ear@@ ity today as a normal thing .
and the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information break@@ through .
now , how about the virtu@@ ality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i &apos;d like to show you that .
how many of the do@@ ors have the house that they live in ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and this is what &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go in the spirit through this house , and they &apos;re living , and look at how many do@@ ors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing .
they &apos;re trans@@ duc@@ ing the reality , and it &apos;s not computers .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
and what we &apos;re going to do at the media cam@@ pus for example , for example , the virtual reality in our v@@ .@@ r@@ . lab , we can actually do it all the time .
and this is the ability to control virtual the reality that the reality that people needed to do in the pre-@@ industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have a books .
or none of them didn &apos;t have phot@@ col@@ to@@ graph@@ y .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that they had , was your head .
and in this head , memory was playing itself .
in this head , knowledge had been auth@@ ori@@ zed and dealing with this virtual ima@@ gery , education , had been stopped to be kept .
and because of that , it &apos;s so powerful in us that we can deal with virtu@@ ality as well as we can .
the interesting thing about this is , if i &apos;m going to take a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time the human was the same time the media produ@@ cer and medium was themselves .
now , if you zo@@ om on a piece of thinking .
what are the media today ?
and then you &apos;ll notice that there has been a change .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about .
cru@@ cial tools of information process@@ ing have been the story of information .
sh@@ am@@ an@@ es , pri@@ est , so-@@ called knowledge has@@ ners , were rele@@ ased to main@@ tain knowledge in stories .
and again , we &apos;re moving very , very strong in stories now .
the auth@@ or of the woman &apos;s book , jon@@ a@@ than &apos;s go@@ d@@ all , we &apos;re still repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly negoti@@ ating a thousand and a half a thousand hours with the re@@ ception of stories .
it means for a kid who has spent it until the year of the great year of the si@@ gue of life has spent the stories of the story of his life .
now , we think our love is based on stories that we have lunch on the lunch of our parents as a child .
no , no , it &apos;s missing it .
it goes on a lot further , into the cultures of the pre-@@ industrial time .
but to me , in the area of inter@@ active media , as a very impres@@ sive thing , we &apos;ve been stru@@ cked by chimpanze@@ es in our biological memory , the ability to think about non@@ lin@@ ear .
i brought you an example of the north american tri@@ be of the no@@ ot@@ ka@@ -@@ indian na@@ ans .
and life lived in the co@@ ast@@ al region of british colum@@ bia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you had to navi@@ gate in sort of navi@@ gation , from island to island , to get their food .
and they &apos;ve done this with this so-@@ called le@@ ad@@ -@@ land cards .
you may also know , if you &apos;re interested a little bit of this , from the austr@@ ali@@ an explor@@ ers .
they &apos;ve got similar principles .
they don &apos;t have le@@ ad@@ -@@ land maps , but they &apos;re using the gene gl@@ ants , or they &apos;ve got to use s@@ mil@@ ing stor@@ es .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navi@@ gation and the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of regi@@ ons were able to be placed by regi@@ ons of songs .
the language where language was sig@@ ned by the under@@ lying ran@@ d .
that is , you &apos;re navi@@ tion@@ ated about sound , and about rhyth@@ m .
and these sounds , and this rhyth@@ m , have the ge@@ ology that shows the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a region , and that has also been able to en@@ able these songs , and then , of course , that you could be able to put these songs , to the right , to the right , to the right , and again , to move back to the bottom
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top of a to b ?
anyway , it &apos;s not to navi@@ gate .
so what &apos;s going on there ?
so that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to be this geni@@ us machine age .
we &apos;ve moved on what &apos;s called the bird age before .
what &apos;s happened is the machine age , and what &apos;s happened is the book , and it &apos;s happened to be the phot@@ oli@@ to@@ gra@@ c@@ us .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have shif@@ ted the responsibility for our memor@@ ies and our own memor@@ ies of our individual memor@@ ies on ex@@ ternal media .
go on the book and on the image .
so , unfortunately , we &apos;ve sa@@ dly used to use god a piece of a piece .
virtu@@ ality has become stran@@ ger for us , and it has nothing to do with the reality .
bru@@ ce brown , a well-@@ known design resear@@ cher at bri@@ gh@@ ton@@ -@@ university , has been so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the image , so not the book and the image , so it &apos;s not television , the internet and so on , and so on , what we call mass media today , that these mass media has cle@@ aten our memor@@ ies , and has changed our ability to modi@@ fy the ability .
so let &apos;s make a little trans@@ fer .
from the beach age to the cre@@ half age .
what does it influence on our thinking and our memor@@ i@@ ration ?
and then , the wa@@ d@@ lock cor@@ respon@@ ds cor@@ respon@@ ds to the pre-@@ industrial culture .
and they are more dis@@ played over cent@@ u@@ ries and more , by cent@@ u@@ ries by the influ@@ ences of the machine age .
so , instead of remem@@ ber@@ ing us individu@@ ally , we have standar@@ di@@ zed , very common , in a massive distribu@@ ted pattern of memor@@ ies that we can make our own personal memor@@ ies .
we &apos;re not producing ourselves anymore .
we have a very abstra@@ ct language , abstra@@ ct language .
we don &apos;t give us the stuff more on images that don &apos;t give things in images , but we co@@ di@@ fy them our language .
we used to be used to things that lin@@ ear happens .
and we have accep@@ ted the lin@@ ear@@ ity as law , and there &apos;s only ex@@ cep@@ tions , like , for example , the financial lin@@ ear@@ ity .
what rema@@ ined us is the girl is chri@@ sti@@ ri@@ zed .
still , we &apos;re very , very in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated to the girl as information investi@@ gation , very strong .
so the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
and we had this speak@@ er age , and we had the machine age , and we now got it called a cy@@ -@@ age called a cy@@ -@@ age
it sounds very , very spac@@ ey , and it sounds very well for sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction , and i know .
but these concep@@ ts of cyber@@ age , who are bringing us all these ways back back to our skills .
this is virtual lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about electrical lin@@ ear@@ ity , it &apos;s about a story .
i just want to explain this a little bit of a little bit .
there are technical concep@@ ts like , for example , the aug@@ mented reality , which means the exp@@ and@@ ed reality .
so if you look at google glass , for example , a concept that allows us to re@@ com@@ bine the virtual world with the real world , that means our aff@@ in@@ ity to virtual world , that means our ac@@ r@@ is to the virtual world , the virtual existence , is being resol@@ ved again .
another example is the so-@@ called virtual reality .
so crazy , of course , in the context of my talk , we may be moving physi@@ cally in un@@ fin@@ ance virtual worl@@ ds , according to the p@@ olo@@ ci@@ cks of the h@@ olo@@ de@@ ll@@ s .
and other examples , the ambi@@ ents , are the ambi@@ ents , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to the people who can respond to a
and so all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtual habit@@ at as a real habit@@ at .
i gradu@@ ated , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the b@@ ach@@ i work of michael bur@@ k , an@@ gas@@ ka@@ thr@@ in c@@ ence , j@@ or@@ is gla@@ nah and jan@@ -@@ mor@@ it@@ is &apos;s g@@ arb@@ ers .
and the two of the last people are here today .
maybe you may be able to stand up , so you can pause in the break with the whole two .
and i brought this project as an example of how again add@@ ressed back to this arch@@ a@@ stic , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say that .
what &apos;s really about the girl , of course , is extremely influ@@ enced , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer game , you have very likely in front of you that people are going around some con@@ dom@@ s , or they &apos;re playing with some con@@ so@@ le in the hand .
anyway , in fact , they &apos;re doing it in the ground .
this is a game out of it .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s meant to do that i &apos;m explor@@ ing the outside world , so that i re@@ con@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the real world .
and this game is conne@@ cting the virtual world , so the data that we produce , with the real world , that we produce , with the real world .
and i &apos;m sorry that i have to cut so much .
you can explain that much better , there &apos;s more more behind it , there &apos;s more more behind it .
and it &apos;s about seeing a city of discovery by looking at where places are positive or a little bit of a little bit of a little
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different impres@@ sion , which i think is a very different sense of negative and positive z@@ ones of a city , and there &apos;s a very different virtual map of a very real size of a very real city of a very real city of a very real city
and that &apos;s what we can like to look at now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another explan@@ ation of what you see in a moment .
and of course , this virtual world in the walls live in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of a flas@@ h@@ light , we can make these virtual worl@@ ds visible .
so , i would like to wra@@ p up my talk and in the sense that the tra@@ its and skills that we &apos;ve been doing from the g@@ ones and the skills that we &apos;ve created from the g@@ ones , and that have been a little bit fre@@ ak@@ y in the machine age that will be activ@@ ated , and that we can actually be activ@@ ated in this way about complex , technologi@@ cal , new products , in fact , not in the future , but actually come back to our roots .
thank you very much .
yeah , i &apos;m very happy to be involved with you .
i &apos;ve been asked whether this s@@ ack is standing there , and i &apos;m going to talk instead of talking about it .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to resol@@ ve what &apos;s inside there .
but i &apos;m just doing it a little bit more curious .
yes , children are really curious , or should be curious , designers should be .
i &apos;m a lot of house , so i &apos;m doing a lot of house , and so i &apos;m doing myself with the theme of curi@@ osity , and how the curi@@ osity also shif@@ ts again , and why we might lose curi@@ osity , and so on and so on , we &apos;re still going to re@@ move it , and so on and so
this is a whole bunch of things that you &apos;re doing with the real existence of being doing as a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
if profess@@ ors are curious , they &apos;ll often s@@ hr@@ ink in the same way in the same se@@ me@@ ster of research .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half of the year .
a recent se@@ me@@ ster@@ y for natural consumption design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself why all of these works with such natural , arch@@ a@@ stic ur@@ ens of communication , interact and so on and so on and so on .
and i &apos;m just just one of these little devices high , because things are supposed to become intui@@ tive , always more natural , more virtual , virtual friend@@ ly , and that &apos;s where you have to go out , which is virtual or intui@@ tive or intui@@ tively .
and in front of the background , i &apos;ve got in natural genetic interface , so the next generation in the last generation of the world &apos;s computers in which the human computer , or how our tools , or how the computer , or how the computer is changing from the computer ca@@ p system to digital assi@@ stant .
so i &apos;ve been enga@@ ged by , of course , or intui@@ tively or intui@@ tively .
maybe we have to look at it again .
so why is this all the time ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , we &apos;re looking at a little bit here , we &apos;re moving forward from the third soci@@ al generation or soci@@ alized form .
so , the modern in the computer society .
every society is consi@@ der@@ ed by a primary media .
at the beginning of the tri@@ b@@ al society , the language of language .
that is , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked about a shared language , you could communicate with each other , and you could communicate with each other , you &apos;ve got to be pulled into the same ca@@ ve , or in other areas , and it has created the tri@@ b@@ al society somehow .
the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very , very living .
and you had to learn about it , so no little child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it in see@@ k@@ essi@@ ve and consi@@ stent , of course .
and that then was em@@ bed@@ ded by the ancient society , and the first form of abstra@@ ction .
this was a huge shot at the time , because , of course , you started to mani@@ fest the life@@ ly language in the form of writing , which is what flu@@ id and lifest@@ yle , i &apos;m going to go and gra@@ b it in stone , and i &apos;m mani@@ pul@@ ating it .
it depen@@ ds on how i &apos;m ban@@ king , and when i &apos;m attac@@ king , of course , it &apos;s a very different narra@@ tive than if there &apos;s a living kind of a living way of being alive .
but su@@ c@@ z@@ essi@@ ve then moved this scri@@ pt as a primary medium , and they came up .
and then the next generation that we actually lived in today is still becoming prime in the next generation .
this is the pressure of pressure and dra@@ wn artic@@ les with gu@@ ten@@ berg and others .
at the time , it was sort of a mon@@ key , where a@@ cl@@ or , bla@@ ver@@ us and others said , are you really in@@ san@@ e when the people start reading , then the after@@ noon is going to be talking about the day , and that &apos;s , of course , completely f@@ at@@ al .
and now we &apos;re going to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , a gener@@ ation shift is just every single few years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomen@@ al phase , and we &apos;re really in this phenomen@@ al phase that we &apos;re involved with .
of course , that &apos;s true of us , because we &apos;re looking at one side of the new media , with the l social media , facebook and so on and so on .
with total transpar@@ ency , which is the new thinking , which is the old thinking of the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the las@@ ag@@ ne &apos;s fl@@ es@@ h , and there &apos;s no more bee@@ f or other phenomen@@ a , so i just want to tr@@ ush this just and want to do that .
and these two worl@@ ds are just going on each other , and new and old thinking .
and what &apos;s exciting about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , has been te@@ sted very many mechanis@@ ms , principle and arch@@ a@@ c paradig@@ ms from the tri@@ b@@ al society .
and yet , it &apos;s not on the local level , but at the global level .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ec@@ ology is a global one .
not if i think local e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally and the neighb@@ or thinks less e@@ col@@ o@@ gical , it doesn &apos;t work all the time .
so , from the local village , in fact , from the local village , it has become a global village with the same principles , possibly , possibly intui@@ tively transpar@@ ently , but also the total transpar@@ ency .
and as you knew in the village , who has known what to do with , and when , today , this is what happens today about this expan@@ sion of our own , through these mobile re@@ vel@@ ation , through the global level of these mobile devices .
it &apos;s that we &apos;re exp@@ and@@ ing understanding glob@@ ally and faster and faster and better .
in the same time , as it happened , it was just happening on the village .
before the background , i &apos;ve just been looking at it , which is , because of us , what is it , what we &apos;ve lost for us , what is there for us , but what is sexu@@ ally , what does the difference look like ? what is the difference that makes
because often you get people , you can &apos;t make it very kin@@ d-@@ friend@@ ly , so anyone can cause it .
so you have to worry about it , which is , not just change it , it &apos;s not just different , but it &apos;s also going to be better .
and while , of course , there &apos;s a little bit intui@@ tively intui@@ tive , and how can i make a lot of work as a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory , and the things seem to make things like this , that they might be intui@@ tive , because then they do fun and they &apos;re just going to use it .
you &apos;re also concerned , even during the study , with the subject of perception and per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve care .
and of course , that &apos;s where you start , and then you look and say , okay , i &apos;ll just go back into the inner self .
and how do you actually look at it in there ?
so how do we do if we look at it in the world ?
and what does it mean , of course , intui@@ tively , and how does our chan@@ n@@ els work and how does the cognitive process@@ ing work work ?
because steve jobs once said , you need to be an exc@@ ell@@ ent chri@@ stian , you know , you know , you know .
so , you really have to look at the detail of something that you want to make something friend@@ ly or intui@@ tively fe@@ at@@ able , which is what it means in the nu@@ cle@@ us .
and what you see is that you see a lot of our seven senses , which most of us think we have only five , now , even seven of us , it &apos;s probably the next future , and it &apos;s probably the next future , and as exten@@ sion again , and as exten@@ sion again .
and to look at how do we process information , how do we take information ?
so , to say , what &apos;s information ?
information is every different thing that makes a difference .
a lot of use the word , however , don &apos;t know what it means to do .
but i need to understand in the core of understanding , in the way information is going to understand information , when it &apos;s about data and information again , so that i know how to do things more intui@@ tively , or , of course , to make things feel intui@@ tively , or , of course , gest@@ ure .
and , of course , how does design make sense of perception .
and we see this when i make things forward , then i can conf@@ use them like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er , or i can actually make it intui@@ tively intui@@ tively , by showing things .
so much more natural , in a bun@@ let , but i &apos;m looking at the right , where there &apos;s s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ es in it .
and when i tell someone , please give me s@@ alt or pe@@ pp@@ er , then he &apos;s going to memor@@ ize at the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side , where &apos;s what &apos;s in there .
and just on the left just intui@@ tively intui@@ tively , and then hopefully , i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in there , the s@@ alt would just be in the face .
but also our perception of consciousness , how they seem to be de@@ vot@@ ed to us .
so , for example , this perception of context .
the ri@@ ght-@@ hand circle looks bigger than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same size , and yet , our perception , depen@@ ding on whatever context , depen@@ ding on what &apos;s going on .
does anyone know what that is ?
call@@ on .
liter@@ ation should be working .
there &apos;s a lot more to my bri@@ cks .
so , it &apos;s like n circle .
a second area is starting to cor@@ rect or associ@@ ate similar .
and if i get another hal@@ br@@ ine , we don &apos;t even see one unit , which is , again , circle , circle , and yet we see a unity , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a different one .
this is what you call com@@ pos@@ er or liter@@ alization , which affec@@ ts us as well in terms of perception as well .
it &apos;s important for the skills that they have most of the very first se@@ me@@ ster , the great pe@@ ac@@ ster laws .
ma@@ ster@@ y of st@@ ones , ma@@ ster@@ y of the continu@@ ity and so on .
and , in fact , in the third time , forget in the third days .
but that &apos;s an essential part of it , if you just want to be able to make things very intui@@ tively , you might be able to be able to
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is that of vision .
sounds very ban@@ al , but it &apos;s really exciting if you &apos;re going to focus with it .
so we have the eyes in front of the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re going to see from the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re looking at the back of the back@@ ward .
you know , they pro@@ v@@ ei@@ ct an assu@@ mption , that you see something that you recognize , you know , you know what they recognize , exactly a great circle .
so , what that means is , we pro@@ v@@ ei@@ ct our view before we can see it , back back into our se@@ ri@@ a , to say , &quot; okay . &quot;
i have this sort of cognitive return of re@@ co@@ very , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
and then that &apos;s there , that &apos;s where it comes back .
and then it goes back , because it &apos;s not going on the back , and it says , &quot; well , hon@@ ey is really going to say , and sure what you &apos;re looking at , and sure that &apos;s what you want to see . &quot;
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
so , a very , very exciting process , how certain things go off and what &apos;s happening for a thou@@ sand@@ -@@ second number of these things happen .
i don &apos;t know who of you know this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described about .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recogni@@ zes what &apos;s familiar .
does anyone see something a particular thing ?
it &apos;s a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er , exactly .
once i saw that , that &apos;s a d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er in there , you know that .
you &apos;re never going to forget about it , because i &apos;m showing you where the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er is .
now you &apos;re looking at the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
and moving on , now you &apos;ll see it .
so , i mean , i &apos;ve actually mis@@ sed them , so that you don &apos;t recognize any pattern in there , but i &apos;ve identi@@ fied it within a very short time to see this dog over again , and i &apos;ve been consi@@ der@@ ed them in a
and this is this proje@@ ction proje@@ ction proje@@ ction proje@@ ction , which is feedback .
now i know i now know , and now i pro@@ v@@ ei@@ ve that i see the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ i .
i &apos;m seeing the d@@ al@@ ma@@ tin@@ er .
so , sort of , very exciting processes , which then , gra@@ y , it &apos;s not really , but there &apos;s just in this ro@@ cket mass , just the same thing that &apos;s just going on .
does anyone know what &apos;s three seconds ?
so long , yes .
so this is our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know , as designers .
if i know , something takes three seconds to sort of go out of the pres@@ ence of the present , then i can also bridge a very good waiting time , and i can also bridge a very good waiting time that i &apos;m doing with someone on three seconds .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s got to do as a present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge very elegan@@ t wait for example , for example , on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what is five milli@@ seconds taking up ?
yes , a milli@@ seconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time where you fall in love .
so , as you know now , if you know this , pay attention to what you &apos;re looking at , because i don &apos;t take a bat@@ e@@ board out there , which can happen to it .
and six milli@@ seconds , a very exciting phenomenon , a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most per@@ cep@@ tions that we have .
so that &apos;s what happens to this first impres@@ sion in a rapi@@ dly slo@@ wer speed , how we percei@@ ve things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking for , and how we &apos;re sort of keeping ourselves in the environment , so that we can think of this as well as we can .
of course , it &apos;s not just about per@@ cep@@ tions and neu@@ ral process@@ ing , or neu@@ ral process@@ ing , or cognitive process@@ y , but pri@@ mar@@ ily , of course , with the issue of human@@ -@@ wise activity .
so , just like a human being , there &apos;s a human deal of things .
there &apos;s a product of product fun@@ ctions , such as for@@ mal aspe@@ cts , such as for@@ mal aspe@@ cts or for@@ mal@@ a@@ es@@ the@@ tic things .
there are a fan@@ cy fun@@ ctions where i know exactly where i &apos;m actually going to take it .
but there &apos;s also symbo@@ lic fun@@ ctions , why does anyone make a little bit of a little bit , where no one &apos;s fit in it , so you know , che@@ cking out of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
and we &apos;re more on symbo@@ lic , in terms of the signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of what we &apos;re doing as a function of course , of course .
so back to my actual theme of natural current interface and the theme , which is , of course , is us@@ at@@ ability .
and the emotion means always means , how can i possibly get a certain dest@@ ination , or how can a user in a certain benefit context can be effective , efficient and satis@@ ble and satis@@ fying a target .
that &apos;s what it says is that it &apos;s more likely to tell the nor@@
how can i possibly make something that might be possible ?
can i use that directly , or i need to do it , or i need to do it , or i need it to do it .
and less transpar@@ ent , or useful it is .
i mean , i &apos;m making it more play@@ ful and beautiful , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better pal@@ at@@ able .
it &apos;s got to understand that .
and if you also saw the software that we &apos;ve just seen , looking at it , then you &apos;ll also understand why nin@@ e-@@ year-@@ 5 percent of our software &apos;s software is less intui@@ tive or not to be reli@@ able or not on the agre@@ ement , the i@@ -@@ pad , in many areas or i@@ -@@ phones , even though it &apos;s very more intui@@ tive than classi@@ c software .
it &apos;s not just an intui@@ tive app@@ lic@@ ability since apple has just been a basic economic factor , an equal success factor , if i want to har@@ ness technology &apos;s engineering devices to people .
so why ?
because in the case of this new kind of us@@ ability , the natural user explor@@ ers , for example , five times faster at average are at the average of our target .
now , you have to imagine that , if you do something of the classi@@ cal so@@ und@@ line , you need five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , there &apos;s only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;ll probably go home four hours to go home , but your emplo@@ yers , or anyone , or anyone , you know , is how to do it with the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s an accu@@ rate phenomenon for us to do things in terms of things .
and if we go back to the real@@ m of software , here &apos;s the first proje@@ ction and early inter@@ faces , which were very abstra@@ ct where you had months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that would come from is that the next thing that is already with an organic neu@@ ral model or mental model , how you &apos;ve worked , that you would have an idea of something , the metaphor , the metaphor , the metaphor of an des@@ k@@ top to make the computer to make the computer .
so , no more zer@@ os and in@@ fan@@ ts or kr@@ yp@@ tic co@@ des , but it &apos;s just a metaphor .
now , this made it all sorts of virtual friend@@ ly , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
so the next generation of graphi@@ cal use of graphi@@ cal use is actually working a lot more with behavior .
so , as a result , i have a lot more frequ@@ ently as a function of behavior than that .
it &apos;s also like a paradig@@ m shift .
and at all , in a while , i think that this looks un@@ consci@@ ously for success , just the us@@ it@@ ance of success , is going to be an app@@ lic@@ ation .
and if i go further into these natural genes , where i go through voice , by language , by language , by touch , with gest@@ ures and not more than mouse and cur@@ sor , then i &apos;m still quick@@ er and even more immedi@@ ate .
but that brings me back to the point , but when will things get intui@@ tively intui@@ tive ?
if you become more intui@@ tive , and then i have to res@@ cu@@ late my little friend here and look at my little friend here , and i &apos;m looking at , what does it really be intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tively intui@@ tive ?
and that &apos;s always a little bit intui@@ tive for us , if i think it &apos;s a little bit intui@@ tive for us to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t seem to be thinking , but it &apos;s very easy to do it , but it &apos;s equ@@ ally easy .
the less way to think about it , the more intui@@ tive it is .
now , what does this mean for the designers ?
so if we look at that , if we look at exi@@ sting action models from one another on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can make it as a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
that is , i can just trans@@ late a intui@@ tive notion of human action model on a software , and make the software to generate a lot of trans@@ ver@@ tis@@ able friend@@ ly .
obviously , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the most intui@@ tive arr@@ ange@@ ment of us from us humans , and now i &apos;ve hin@@ ted to it .
this is what we call o@@ si@@ g model .
it uses each of us , and o@@ cy is an ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m and it &apos;s a ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m and sel@@ it@@ ated , in@@ formed , and trans@@ forming .
now , it &apos;s all of you all the time , but it makes it un@@ consci@@ ously , and it &apos;s very intui@@ tive , or par@@ tly , and par@@ tly , too instin@@ ctive .
the model is going to be in the wom@@ b , and it &apos;s inter@@ cul@@ tur@@ ally , so it works around the world with young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without most of us have known that this model is there .
o@@ cul@@ o@@ ous o@@ wes@@ s is about about fif@@ ty to seven times of us ever after activity , so in the sleep , they realized that it &apos;s a lot less re@@ co@@ very than a day .
i can now ori@@ ent this mental action model , sel@@ ec@@ ted , in@@ form , trans@@ forming , trans@@ forming a interaction system .
and through this kind of trans@@ mission , similar as with the metaphor of the des@@ k@@ top , now no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but there &apos;s a metaphor of a re@@ ference pattern , a match of a re@@ ference .
and this is on a higher gra@@ ke of the user kin@@ dness than the trans@@ mission of a classi@@ cal metaphor , which is the des@@ k@@ top .
and if i trans@@ mit this now , for example , in which i &apos;m con@@ fir@@ med as ex@@ pos@@ ure , sele@@ ct as a sele@@ ction , i &apos;m deci@@ ding as choice , in@@ forming , i can look at it in detail , and i can look at it in detail , and i can just throw it up somewhere or buy someone , and so on , so on .
and then i can trans@@ mit the whole whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to go through one example of a talk .
need@@ while , everyone has been eating pi@@ g .
in conclu@@ sion , i &apos;m sort of inter@@ acting with the object , and i can zo@@ om out and zo@@ om back up and zo@@ om .
i &apos;m going to get the whole tran@@ view now , and i can actually go out here and say , show me all the thing about cho@@ col@@ ate , for example .
once again , once a interface , which is more intui@@ tive and a lot more natural .
because i can click things like the things that can be able to touch , and they come up to me , is basically more natural than if you &apos;re talking about hier@@ arch@@ ically organized web@@ sites or other mechanis@@ ms , in a way , to make these things available .
imagination is more , more plastic , and with that phr@@ ase , i &apos;d like to conclu@@ de , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to conclu@@ de , and again , the designers need to think differently to come up with new solutions , and in that particular sense , thank you very well for your attention and please .
i &apos;d like to help you with a very particular aspe@@ ct of curi@@ osity .
the first thing that you get big as a kid , as a baby , is that they take care of what they do , yes ? and depen@@ ding on whether their parents allowed them to play more or less in the wal@@ ks , the more , the curi@@ osity , the curi@@ osity , of course , is going to stand up with it .
and the curi@@ osity doesn &apos;t get learning .
that &apos;s why all of those who are and curious are , in fact , people who have a property that can &apos;t be learned with .
what i &apos;m about now is , fundament@@ ally , all of this environmental discussion , global up@@ ward , 3@@ 0-@@ year-old clu@@ b@@ -@@ fol@@ ds , in quality , in quality of education .
and there &apos;s a central point with this .
and it depen@@ ds on phosp@@ hor@@ us .
give pe@@ e a chance .
every day , they give them a lot of magni@@ tude of about two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and they have to take two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and you have to take two gra@@ ms of phosp@@ hor@@ us .
otherwise , you can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t attra@@ ct energy .
you can &apos;t have a b@@ ones .
we could just swa@@ p up the glo@@ be through the oceans of the oceans .
if we actually don &apos;t take a phosp@@ hor@@ us and give it off .
what &apos;s amazing is it is that we &apos;re concerned about something that would actually be wor@@ th@@ while , but it &apos;s not really that it &apos;s really not that
because everybody &apos;s talking about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about phosp@@ hor@@ -@@ hor@@ ning problem .
the phosp@@ hor@@ us problem is a lot of cri@@ tic .
we dep@@ end out of two countries .
we have only for two years of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and already we &apos;re now going to get a lot more ur@@ ani@@ on min@@ ing in the environment worldwide , and we &apos;ve used a lot more ur@@ ani@@ um in the environment , as it &apos;s used in all
in fact , in the last two years , 500 thousand tons of ur@@ ani@@ um have been dis@@ placed on our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
it makes leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a in children .
and we think we &apos;d protect the environment , if we &apos;re a little less har@@ m@@ ful .
so , for example , the environment , the less car .
sha@@ ke the environment , lose less waste .
sha@@ ke the environment , it uses less energy .
but that &apos;s not a protection .
that &apos;s what i would say , if i say , your kid , only three times instead of five times instead of five times .
it &apos;s just a little bit less de@@ ad@@ line .
if we think about the whe@@ els to the ba@@ ble , our whole earth will be early or later , or later , a ce@@ as@@ tery .
it &apos;s about thinking about the ones that seem to think about .
and the most important thing is to look at the floor first , first of all .
there &apos;s about six percent of the carbon in the bottom of the carbon .
so right now , we &apos;re building cor@@ n and lost between 11 kil@@ ogra@@ ms of 3@@ 0-@@ dollar tons per he@@ ct@@ ill , or on the square meter , or on the square meter .
that is , we &apos;re losing about fif@@ ths in the ground about fif@@ ths , about fif@@ ths of time .
of course , we can first look at the g@@ arb@@ age problem .
and everything is pac@@ k@@ was@@ hing or content .
for example , in nar@@ b@@ ble , for example , on the 40@@ ash budget , they &apos;re 20 percent of the g@@ arb@@ age in the budget .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the ste@@ ering of the wind gets bigger .
these are , in some of them , they &apos;re all in the bottom of the time .
yes , ?
a baby takes about six cop@@ ads of mountain .
and of course , we could reduce it by 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is ex@@ clu@@ ded in china in a second .
this is completely bar@@ dr@@ al .
so the question is , how are we going to deal with these win@@ ds ?
here &apos;s one of the pro@@ of of the pro@@ of that men aren &apos;t pig@@ s .
i &apos;m going to tell you .
because the phosp@@ hor@@ us is provi@@ ded with the pig@@ s on the fix@@ es of the com@@ pre@@ hen@@ si@@ ble parts
in the ur@@ in of ur@@ in .
yeah , yes .
so men can &apos;t be pig@@ s with that .
because this is what it is , isn &apos;t it ?
tradition@@ ally , we think in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you tell people that if you listen to the people , if you say , that would be better , you &apos;re going to do that , you &apos;re going to be more fri@@ gh@@ table and ho@@ sti@@ le and ho@@ sti@@ le .
and so , someone like al gore , one of our great hero@@ es , there &apos;s nothing more important than to stabili@@ ze the human population .
in israel , you say if you &apos;re saving a human life , you fill the earth .
this is what it says , the more you get , the better one .
yeah , yes .
so the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , the ants wei@@ gh about four times more than we do .
i could take it ter@@ mit@@ es , but in the united states , nobody may seem to be in the same way , even though they &apos;re vege@@ t@@ ari@@ ans .
that means that ants wei@@ gh a lot more than we do .
and because they are physi@@ cally working to work more hard than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re pres@@ ented in their weight , in energy consumption , in energy consumption , something that &apos;s 3@@ nant billion people .
that is , we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and as you see how far we &apos;re away from it , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we &apos;re actually on earth , can you see that , for example , nar@@ b@@ ach has a program , until 20 thousand miles you &apos;d like to be a cli@@ cer@@ -@@ eu@@ tra@@ l here , yes ?
you can only be a cli@@ -@@ eu@@ tra@@ l if you &apos;re not exi@@ sting , yes ?
so the only chance .
have you ever seen a cli@@ me eu@@ cular tree once ?
yes , ?
a single one ?
that is , our whole intelligence means that we want to be blan@@ k as trees , yes ?
yes , ?
no tree is a carb@@ on-@@ neu@@ tra@@ l .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , yes , yes ?
there &apos;s no over@@ all re@@ venue problem of trees .
there are still six trees in the ama@@ zon in the ama@@ zon area .
you &apos;ve heard of a little bit of over@@ population problems from trees , or by trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be blan@@ k as a trees .
and as you can see , even by de@@ meter , the rou@@ gh@@ est bio@@ diversity -- yes far@@ ming , doesn &apos;t allow our own me@@ tab@@ oli@@ c products back .
every year , we &apos;re losing three million tons of phosp@@ hor@@ us , who really have to go back in circu@@ und@@ ance .
and that &apos;s what we do too many .
just talk about it .
we feel that we feel so gu@@ il@@ ty on earth that we say . there &apos;s no bio@@ -@@ land , no bi@@ ol@@ and , no way of re@@ crea@@ tional pro@@ gr@@ è@@ i@@ s , and all of all , that allow us to go back with our own re@@ actions .
isn &apos;t that being sad ?
and we &apos;re too many things .
it &apos;s safe to be less har@@ m@@ ful , less har@@ m@@ ful , which is oil consumption .
but where are we going to be useful ?
we &apos;re trying to mini@@ mi@@ ze our e@@ col@@ o@@ gical foot@@ print , but it &apos;s about having a big foot@@ print that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , the ulti@@ mate thing is not to be there , yes ?
nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ ta@@ sions , yes ?
you can only have nu@@ l@@ le@@ mis@@ sions if they &apos;re not there .
even if they were sho@@ ot@@ ing now , they would have emissions .
so , you can &apos;t solve that .
and we can do it differently .
we can get rid of our nutri@@ ents back .
we &apos;re doing in brazil in brazil where we re@@ gain the nutri@@ ents .
in the same way , we can get rid of nutri@@ ents in agriculture , in this way .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re going to take the waste of it .
in china , there &apos;s still a laun@@ ch of hon@@ e@@ len@@ e@@ ks today , and it &apos;s sort of , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too du@@ m@@ b to bring our nutri@@ ents back .
that is , the entire western civili@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ story is the fact that the city has always recor@@ ded , but has never given the farmers back a little bit .
and by the way , the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went to the cities , and the cities would continue to get their nutri@@ ents further away .
that &apos;s why all of the west &apos;s west are always exp@@ and@@ ed until they don &apos;t have done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re im@@ cu@@ ted .
yes , ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a fra@@ c@@ less civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring your nutri@@ ents back .
even today , when you &apos;re invited to lunch in china , you &apos;re expected for dinner , you &apos;re going to stay off until you &apos;re looking for the toi@@ let .
because it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly , and it &apos;s un@@ friend@@ ly to go .
you &apos;ve got them to put them to the food , not for the nutri@@ tious the@@ ft .
that is , you can see on the internet how you can re@@ gain the nutri@@ ents .
in fact , what &apos;s nice about this is that if you do this , agriculture is produ@@ ces , bi@@ og@@ as , on a vac@@ able country with five thousand infe@@ cts in fa@@ vel@@ as , can make a farmer about a thou@@ sand@@ -@@ plus and a half a thousand dollars , and the plant and the vege@@ tables and vege@@ tables and fish and fish and fish and fish
and the great thing about this is that the rate rate goes back to the fa@@ vel@@ as by over nin@@ e-@@ year-@@ 99 percent .
so , we don &apos;t have to control people , necessarily , to be bad .
we can support them , to be good .
this is high-@@ tech agriculture , of course , but the facili@@ ties themselves are carrying themselves .
the very side of the world is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed , by the design , that a farmer can easily save them .
that is , this is what &apos;s going to go back to the rate of time
and none of these facili@@ ties , we &apos;ve been built now over a hundred t@@ 5 years in the last two years , none of these facili@@ ties have ever been s@@ w@@ ab@@ hed .
you could just throw up a li@@ ter of al@@ ste@@ l , and then the facili@@ ty would be ru@@ ined over the years .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that is , we don &apos;t have to control people , to be less likely to be bad .
we can support them , to be good .
that is , we have to get back to phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you write in germany , in germany , in germany , in germany , that &apos;s in fr@@ au@@ t &apos;s disease .
unfortunately , not in str@@ us@@ ks , but maybe you can do a little bit of a little bit of the cho@@ kes .
because the frank@@ ly facili@@ ty could best re@@ gain the phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and that &apos;s got to go back .
what we see is that it &apos;s really critical to phosp@@ hor@@ us .
and we &apos;ll see that it works off .
we &apos;ve been using in h@@ oll@@ and now over three years .
the du@@ tch government has expla@@ ined that they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is what phosp@@ hor@@ us w@@ ins .
but we need that all the time .
you know , there are two countries that control almost seven percent of the phosp@@ hor@@ us of phosp@@ hor@@ us in the world .
there &apos;s op@@ e@@ c a bunch of or@@ phan@@ en@@ ks .
that &apos;s six and two-@@ year countries , which are the four@@ -@@ percent of oil supp@@ lies .
and the oil is going to replace us through other energy fun@@ ds .
but the phosp@@ hor@@ us is not going to replace you .
that &apos;s not how to make the exi@@ sting insi@@ ghts a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and most of all , it &apos;s what the right thing is to do .
that is , it &apos;s about efficiency , it &apos;s not about efficiency .
in h@@ oll@@ and , of course , it &apos;s easier to understand that , because in h@@ oll@@ and , the country is built on flo@@ wers .
yes , ?
imagine if your wife is sad , for example , if you anno@@ yed them , and you come with fif@@ ty ro@@ ses .
totally in@@ efficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , yes ?
or take a li@@ p sti@@ ck .
a woman in germany disappe@@ ats about six com@@ ic three kil@@ ogra@@ ms during her life .
this is what .
it &apos;s not exactly what science doesn &apos;t cor@@ rect , because we don &apos;t know how much water is going to be was@@ hed .
but a li@@ p pen , even at this light , i can tell you , is completely in@@ efficient , but it &apos;s really effective , yes ?
the one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not about resource efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
to say , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better and throw it off a little bit better and throw it to the in@@ struc@@ tion@@ ary plant to lose all the materials for cy@@ cl@@ ers , but first to ask , how do you train wir@@ es ?
imagine mo@@ z@@ art efficiency more efficient .
yes , ?
when i give you dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a tab@@ let with cha@@ b@@ ble taste and a glass of water to do it .
wonderful , hu@@ h ?
that &apos;s effici@@ ently .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not effici@@ ently efficient .
if you fall to love in somebody , you &apos;re efficient ?
yes , ?
that is , everything that coun@@ ts in life , is it &apos;s not about saving , to reduce it .
the entire environmental discussion .
we tell people , like yes , you don &apos;t have any environmental in the south .
no , thro@@ wing away is exactly the right thing , yes ?
so , at any point where you throw away , from , yes , you get life@@ ways again .
but the wrong thing is .
if you throw the wrong stuff away , you have a g@@ arb@@ age problem .
in terms of north , we think of north .
there &apos;s all the foot@@ prin@@ ting of foot@@ prin@@ ts .
if you walk , yes , every foot@@ print destro@@ yed the floor .
because the soil is going to die the mo@@ s@@ ses , and the wind , and the water is was@@ hing off the floor .
but if you &apos;re in it@@ al@@ y , every foot@@ print means that the water is longer in the me@@ a@@ dow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big foot@@ print that &apos;s going to be a we@@ t@@ le@@ field .
not a school gui@@ dance .
we &apos;re saying sustain@@ ability sustain@@ ability .
yes , ?
but when i ask you , how do you do with your wife like this ?
so what do you say ?
sustain@@ n@@ essi@@ ons .
and then i say , heart attra@@ ction , yes ?
that &apos;s the minim@@ um of the minim@@ um .
so don &apos;t save , fu@@ ri@@ ous , avoid avo@@ i@@ ding .
any waste of waste is nutri@@ ent .
and it &apos;s a l@@ ure when you see it@@ al@@ ing in it@@ al@@ y , like the people in the high bo@@ w , you throw out of the car like this , and so on .
because , you know , that &apos;s a really fun process .
it &apos;s a form of re@@ ven@@ u@@ es , yes ?
you can show me , i was there .
but with the right design , there &apos;s a real deal .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a protein pac@@ ket pac@@ ka@@ ge , which is in the space temper@@ atures .
you can throw them off where you &apos;re going to go and stand .
in two hours , they generate them all over the world .
and they con@@ tains with rare plants , so that they contribu@@ te through the diversity of bio@@ diversity .
that is , we &apos;re useful , not less har@@ m@@ ful .
so , there are two bran@@ ches of bran@@ ches .
not everything should be com@@ post@@ able , of course .
a television or a was@@ hing machine , they just don &apos;t use it , they don &apos;t use
just the things that are s@@ wee@@ ping , like sho@@ ot@@ ers , like spon@@ ge , like the auth@@ ori@@ ties , they have to be going in biological systems .
the things that are just used are going to be technolog@@ ical systems .
but today , we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yes , ?
like , for example , s@@ ne@@ ak@@ er , yes ?
quite direct adverti@@ sing , not for the company pu@@ ma per capit@@ a , but that they &apos;re now helping this business to make these products success@@ fully .
because we don &apos;t do the things more free from it .
yes , ?
so , when i invi@@ te them to lunch and say , that &apos;s free from bur@@ lets , then they don &apos;t really motiv@@ ate them .
no , we &apos;re deci@@ sting what &apos;s in there .
very positive .
so , it &apos;s not like de@@ to@@ x .
it &apos;s not tox@@ ic in it .
it &apos;s all useful in there , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can start with the ca@@ v@@ al@@ ine at the pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an light , and you can go to the ru@@ b@@ m@@ ine in biological cir@@ cles , yes ?
all of this is com@@ pres@@ sed about it .
and when we do , of course , we can do it for go@@ den , for ni@@ ke , for we@@ mor , for we@@ mor , and the whole tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the ab@@ water problems around the world , which is caused by the tex@@ ti@@ le industry .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re helping it , ask people to do it .
hey , pu@@ ma , do you really get serious ?
because they &apos;ve moved twice the board of the board already twice now .
and i &apos;m not so sure if she really leaves it .
so , help me a little bit about this .
but here it is .
yeah , yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s just been shown .
that &apos;s what it is .
now , we can do things like this , that if you &apos;re bu@@ red , if you break , you can get in biological cir@@ cles .
technical swi@@ t@@ ches are the same thing .
and there &apos;s a direct return system for this .
this is the first e@@ col@@ o@@ gical back@@ pack , in fact , that &apos;s made to go back in the circu@@ lation .
it &apos;s also , so in each store , you can get things back .
when you get to that , yes ?
you remember the win@@ k again ?
now , if it &apos;s now the waste .
and everywhere , these win@@ ds are round , almost , almost .
in the countries where people come to their money .
there &apos;s on the de@@ light , but also else in the landscape , yes ?
if we change plastic , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water stor@@ age , inside that they can just go back to cell@@ u@@ lo@@ si@@ sts , then you can be able to have a baby in israel , or in tun@@ isi@@ a , hundreds of 5@@ ,@@ 500 trees .
yes , ?
so , even if you take these win@@ l , you damage color@@ ers , and you get ster@@ ili@@ zed , and you take the trees to plant trees .
that &apos;s the baby &apos;s carbon positive for the whole life , at the very beginning , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need any cli@@ mis@@ -@@ neu@@ tra@@ l , we can be climate to be climate .
it &apos;s sort of a behavior po@@ me machine .
yeah , that &apos;s what you do .
yes , ?
that &apos;s what we can do .
we can rein@@ vent it all again .
i started an institute of this .
there &apos;s a lot of people working with , and they can all be enga@@ ged .
there &apos;s extra sele@@ ction to inv@@ ent cra@@ d@@ irs to cra@@ d@@ al , where anyone can be involved .
so it &apos;s not saving anymore , bur@@ sting , avoid avo@@ i@@ de , re@@ duced , no school management , but smar@@ ts waste .
do you make that curious ?
thank you very much .
it &apos;s the work of the word .
music as a language .
in the descri@@ ption of my talk , i &apos;ve written that as a word , i think , as a transl@@ ator , is in english , in english .
interpre@@ ts are transl@@ ated from the written notes in clinical music .
that , as transl@@ ated as transl@@ ators , you can &apos;t over@@ lay the text to a different language , but also the deeper sense of words and the words of words and the status club , so that there &apos;s a meaning@@ ful transl@@ ation of the words that you have to do with gran@@ ted languages .
already from the ger@@ man@@ s , transl@@ ates to english can require more knowledge , once if you do about di@@ sting , or even about poetry .
and it &apos;s very stran@@ ger , but what we do for la@@ ve , what we &apos;re doing with our music language .
as a word of a piece of music , i &apos;ve only been the written notes i &apos;ve ever had .
you think that the element has written exactly everything in the notes exactly everything that he has imag@@ ined .
in fact , the notes are very va@@ gue and un@@ equal .
these notes are about the same as just as un@@ equal , as a verb@@ al , as well as a verb@@ al , and very appar@@ ent of a landscape , appe@@ est@@ y of a landscape .
because in this verb@@ al landscape , the sound is not too gl@@ ori@@ ous to smell the flo@@ wers of the flo@@ wers , just to the degree of the structure just to listen to the win@@ ds of the win@@ der , not to feel feeling .
that means that the interpre@@ ts needs to trans@@ late these un@@ pre@@ ce@@ sions of the subject language into another , nam@@ ely hearing , con@@ cre@@ te , non@@ verb@@ al music language .
today i &apos;m going to show you what i would like to trans@@ late music , so that &apos;s interpre@@ ting , again , to a verb@@ al language .
so it &apos;s basically a trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
that &apos;s why i pre@@ tend to do this all the time in ger@@ man , because if i had to trans@@ late it into english again , it would be fundament@@ ally relevant to trans@@ lation of trans@@ lation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spo@@ ken language .
the notes had written the function of the letters of a scri@@ pt .
so it &apos;s not that it doesn &apos;t make notes to read notes , and the butt@@ ons respond to the piano , or the right place on a vi@@ o@@ string string .
these are just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters you can &apos;t tell when you can do the language of it .
so for the learning process of music , you need to take music language at least as long as the spo@@ ken language .
and then there &apos;s a little bit about whether you learn it for gran@@ ted , just passi@@ ve , or you can also talk about active , until to the musical na@@ tive sa@@ yo@@ r .
so the work of the word starts very similar to the theater &apos;s work .
so after first you &apos;re looking at a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re actually starting to start the beginning of the com@@ position of the com@@ position .
you colle@@ ct information about the play in the bedro@@ ration of the city liter@@ ature .
you read in your letters , po@@ ll@@ s , notes , or whether or words , thoughts from com@@ pos@@ ers , thoughts .
you &apos;re studying the works that he has com@@ pla@@ ined before and after after@@ wards .
and you can compare compar@@ ison .
the movement of writing to write it .
how did it feel , and what did he mean ?
what was its circum@@ stances , like the society and policy ?
all of this is interested in me .
you think of it in this time , by looking at con@@ temporary pictures , or read the liter@@ ature .
but over time , however , as interpre@@ ts , you have a fair knowledge of the com@@ pos@@ er that you &apos;re playing more often , and it &apos;s getting easier to think yourself in and feeling yourself in and feeling yourself .
the compon@@ ent is becoming more to the friend that you &apos;re living with .
his concern@@ s to write the piece is going to be more and more and more to my own personal concern@@ s to play it .
so , since the notes is anything other than an accu@@ rate record of the com@@ pos@@ er , it &apos;s just a sc@@ aff@@ old , so i &apos;m going to turn this frame@@ work to fill it back with sense and meaning .
i &apos;m going to say to my own words , which may be written between this frame@@ work .
i &apos;m going to play what these sounds might have to mean .
now , for me and for the com@@ pos@@ er , and what they might mean for him today .
each note , every phr@@ ase gets a sense of it , because i feel it myself , because it cap@@ tures in my own way in my own now .
it has to be liber@@ ous for me and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience , that that &apos;s my cause , that that &apos;s my cause .
there &apos;s always a very lucky conc@@ ert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been able to do so long in the way that i &apos;ve been working on the past time .
as you get to re@@ fin@@ ing a happy new day and again , even though with the same ritu@@ als of life , stand up , standing , break@@ fast , to work , i &apos;m going to go through the same piece over and over again and over again .
i &apos;ve become older again , and i &apos;ve become older , and my pul@@ se goes slo@@ wer down at night than the morning , in a conc@@ ert room takes it to come back at home as at home as at home
i &apos;m going to take you right of the audience , consci@@ ously or un@@ consci@@ ously .
and all of this affec@@ ts me , and all of this affec@@ ts my experience with the com@@ position .
it &apos;s wonderful , too , if i stand with a du@@ o partner on the stage , and we have the same wa@@ vel@@ ength .
then the same thing that happens is the same as a good , talking .
you get a new idea inside , and the same thing is going to respond with a response .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things are doing things that we haven &apos;t done , and what you can &apos;t do is that we can &apos;t
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and they have learned as the audience communic@@ ated , and then they &apos;ve learned how music communic@@ ates .
and so each conc@@ ert is a different conc@@ ert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like that , as in that moment .
i can &apos;t play the same thing as 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life experiences than today , and i &apos;m going to have to look at my pal@@ ette of music sound , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more color on music and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some color@@ s of paint , but i &apos;m going to have some color@@ s to get it .
have a nice con@@ struc@@ tive example of that .
it was on a piano shot for music students at my loved old teacher , professor j@@ ack@@ ess u@@ de , a well-@@ known bee@@ tho@@ ven@@ -@@ speci@@ alist , conc@@ ert pian@@ ist , and slow a professor &apos;s professor in pit@@ ch in st@@ lau@@ ghter .
unfortunately , i was still too young , so that he had been in place when i finally started to study .
but i had the great fortun@@ e to meet it very early , with three years , with three years , and so i was on his clas@@ ses for my school
i was 17 years old when i first opened up on one of his cour@@ ses , and i was playing the last one of the four bal@@ ats of ch@@ op@@ in , who was a little bit of my work .
he asked me what would be the introdu@@ ction of this can@@ la@@ ding for me .
this is such a fe@@ a@@ dic@@ ation compon@@ ent .
and in my you@@ th , i said , expec@@ tation , i said .
there he was sho@@ ot@@ ing , and he said , like that ?
that &apos;s got to be the aging difference .
because , for me , it means memory .
he was about six years .
well , with 17 years , you have dreams , but there &apos;s no major memor@@ ies .
i &apos;m going to play this piece of now every few years , and i &apos;ve always shif@@ ted it , even though it has not changed a single note .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;ll read something new , because again , i &apos;ll read something new .
an example of this from a very different region : mon@@ et has pain@@ ted the se@@ a@@ ses x times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in a different day , in a different light , in different light .
he transl@@ ated the se@@ a@@ sis shif@@ ts , as he saw it , as she saw it , as she was able to do it
his own personal impres@@ sions of the se@@ ero@@ ses .
the x@@ en-@@ t interpretation of a piece it is that compar@@ able .
in the mean@@ est , i &apos;ve been more than ch@@ op@@ in with two years when he wrote the piece article .
he &apos;s lived only nine years of years .
and i &apos;m really important to look into the notes , even though i think it can be able to memor@@ ize it .
to keep news , right with com@@ pos@@ ers , right .
because the notes are the only connection directly to him .
most of all , when he &apos;s ever died .
well , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you need to say , you need to do something about the spo@@ ken language for it .
often , the music class is so often , you know , you learn to read the notes .
you &apos;re learning prac@@ tically reading this before , before you &apos;re just talking about one word .
you learn to find the sound to find the notes on the instrument .
and then , when all the fing@@ ers are in time and the way it &apos;s in the no@@ des , they come out and then come out and gra@@ b sounds that sound like music .
when the er@@ ror happens , the student gets to the end of the next thing .
it &apos;s har@@ dly spo@@ ken by interpretation in the beginning of time .
all right , there &apos;s a very quick piece , that &apos;s a quick piece .
len@@ to , slowly .
l@@ oud and touch , wake and b , etc , etc .
that &apos;s what most of us here know .
but even if you put out these ads , there &apos;s still a little bit more technical .
and there &apos;s always no interpretation of interpretation .
i &apos;m just hun@@ ting .
i &apos;ll just wonder that you often forget a little bit of a very fundamental thing .
that is that , in order to make music on the instrument , your musical musical , and feel like that should be there before .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re sing@@ ing .
a child who doesn &apos;t have learned that because it hasn &apos;t done the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it by itself .
it &apos;s like talking in talking .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music , then to do it more about a tool , a kind of instrument , to make sound .
people who &apos;ve never been enga@@ ged , have never appe@@ ared to their own body , as it &apos;s like to form a sound .
to make a phr@@ ase with his own breath .
the music instrument is the exp@@ and@@ ing of our body .
we can go to sing , to sing our hands , and feet and feet .
so the ham@@ ri@@ d@@ heads are the progress of my fing@@ ers on the piano .
the mel@@ o@@ dy comes from the bottom and the rhyth@@ m from the dance .
now , the generation of history today with music is not pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly accu@@ rate .
you don &apos;t need to do music even if it &apos;s bor@@ ed to you .
no longer requi@@ red to whi@@ st@@ le or sing@@ ing or sing@@ ing .
every one of your own music will be exp@@ and@@ ed by the outside of music with music as well .
and sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i ask that , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you think they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
either of all , it &apos;s not too late to find out if you can &apos;t yet , or learn how to do it or learn how to put these little mus@@ cles , cor@@ rect the message .
and this is what you can train .
or c , because they agre@@ ed to them that they &apos;re un@@ per@@ per@@ red .
and i ask , how determin@@ ably compe@@ tent was this kind of diagno@@ sis ?
have you done a second or a third or a third of third , how do you tell it beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music and you want to do that as well as not to do with it .
but what i was going to do , because music is a beautiful , communic@@ ative thing .
but maybe you can face them even more .
well , so you see , on all cases , no one needs to be a fair can@@ di@@ d@@ at .
but don &apos;t say , &quot; don &apos;t tell you , i don &apos;t understand classi@@ cal music .
i can &apos;t tell you if it &apos;s good or bad .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying , but sure you can &apos;t tell you whether or not it like you .
because i don &apos;t think it tells someone , somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t co@@ ok , because i can &apos;t co@@ ok
so , they didn &apos;t , just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok , just because they can &apos;t co@@ ok .
so , you don &apos;t have to es@@ ph@@ ink in classi@@ cal music , because they don &apos;t play any instrument .
listen consci@@ ously and tell you if you taste them or not .
whether the music is co@@ jac@@ ent or too swe@@ et .
tell you what you feel .
over time , you get cla@@ ims and you want a little bit more co@@ kes there , or taste your taste , even in a very di@@ vor@@ ce differences .
so why do i re@@ mind my audience , that it &apos;s also active to be active ?
because the music is a language , and it &apos;s a language for communic@@ ating there .
a piece of art you never look at , doesn &apos;t make any power .
the food that has been coo@@ ked by a che@@ f or a che@@ f , has had to be e@@ aten and not just looked at re@@ cep@@ te or re@@ cep@@ ts .
so stop listening when a music is going to play .
it &apos;s not just a nice so@@ und@@ board .
if in a context where the adult motiv@@ ation music or at least , or at least active music , or at least active music , it &apos;s a little bit easy for a music teacher to ask , what color has your flo@@ wer ?
now , can you play me in blue now ?
and the kid is playing , after a memory , instead of a red flo@@ wer , instead of before a blue flo@@ wer .
and this sounds very differently than before .
so that was the very first set of a musical expression of your own musical expression
so the first step to a interpretation of interpretation .
and what happens when you &apos;re playing a piece today , which is origin@@ ally described a hundred , two hundred or three hundred years ago , or three hundred years ago ?
in the mean@@ while , the instru@@ ments continu@@ ed .
there was still no longer an instrument at the time of the time .
it was just not being invented yet .
i think the stream would have been thri@@ ll@@ ed if he had had the sound of the modern new stro@@ ke of modern pian@@ os .
i can tell the sound of the b@@ ach that b@@ ach has had to look at the modern wing of what a b@@ aro@@ ck@@ ie c@@ em@@ bal@@ o can &apos;t do .
also , bee@@ tho@@ ven also knows that he bel@@ on@@ gs to more than he had gotten dea@@ f .
today , a modern orche@@ str@@ a is able to play everything , which is a symbol of a orche@@ str@@ a from the time that it &apos;s un@@ func@@ tion@@ able .
and so the com@@ pos@@ ers on us are interpre@@ ted on us that are rein@@ vent@@ ing the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be hearing , which you &apos;ve just thought of in the spirit .
and also , you know , what you would think in the spirit today .
or what i &apos;m going to suggest today , because what you might have thought about .
thank you very much .
you know , what &apos;s the l@@ ength of it
have you ever been an@@ sti@@ cally ?
and how did that feel like that ?
sh@@ opp@@ ing .
i have a friend , which is pul@@ ling a pas@@ ser@@ at@@ i .
and when i come there , with my little v pi@@ es@@ el , and i &apos;m going to finish up with this feeling , this feeling comes up .
i &apos;m sho@@ ot@@ ing a little bit through your head .
i &apos;m saying , hon@@ ary , what do you need to do with a lot of car ?
in fact , that &apos;s the first year half of its asse@@ ts in the first year
and at least , you &apos;re working much less than i did .
why should i have to afford a little little car like that ?
and then immediately , it seems to me immediately , that &apos;s un@@ fair .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice , it &apos;s this un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling away .
our organis@@ m has invented a great method to get these un@@ comfortable feelings like ris@@ d just to disappe@@ ar .
you can also try to try that with words like ra@@ kes or win or something like that .
so i &apos;m going to show you something about this mechan@@ ism today , or something , which is un@@ conscious to you , which is un@@ conscious .
the mechan@@ ism came from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie , as you may have heard you , when people say , no one has a wall to build a wall .
and then ro@@ cks kno@@ ck up , so he &apos;s going to give you the view .
one of these lie you see that the li@@ ars themselves don &apos;t think what he says .
it &apos;s easily fig@@ uring out easily that it has a very different thing in mind .
he &apos;s just going to be sc@@ aring them and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , who has to do with themselves .
you need these guys to get a li@@ ve@@ li@@ hood of life to main@@ tain a sense of self-@@ de@@ ception .
they can get them less , yes , check , watch or go into the ground .
and they need time .
from that time , an an@@ ec@@ do@@ te talks about that time you may know .
the span@@ ish pain@@ ter p@@ ab@@ l@@ o pic@@ as@@ so has once portra@@ dered a woman .
this woman was very com@@ pla@@ ining that the portra@@ it wouldn &apos;t look very much to see her .
pic@@ as@@ so , they &apos;re just going to wait .
it &apos;s always more similar to them .
and at this point , if you lau@@ gh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time they need to learn something , what artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a huge relationship to lie .
the artists shares you a little bit , and most of the time that lady , which you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artists are communic@@ ating you in such a portra@@ it with what they &apos;re about to be familiar with when you &apos;re looking at this piece of art and over again .
and then the un@@ pleas@@ ant feeling disappe@@ ars , it might not look very similar to you , and it will always be more similar to them .
what you &apos;ve got here is this mechan@@ ism that allows us to use the lie as a great invention for the stress of our li@@ fes@@ pan .
and not just in art , even in the fol@@ ds , in my@@ th@@ ology , in the my@@ th@@ ology , in stories , it &apos;s coming up again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him , who is the most beautiful thing all over the country ?
one day , this one tells me , yes , there &apos;s a very beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains , and so on .
and also , you know how much ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty from this real orig@@ in , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that matter of real emer@@ ges .
but we should just make us feel familiar with a woman that you can &apos;t tell a woman , that there &apos;s a very beautiful somewhere in the other place .
here &apos;s what we understand under polio cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness , to bring back again again .
we need this lie that hol@@ ds us the de@@ ception , without which we can &apos;t live , without which we can &apos;t live
we don &apos;t just have in art , in fact , in the hall@@ sc@@ ore poetry , but in science , in science , these great lies .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s daughter &apos;s talk of the bis@@ cho@@ w .
and she heard about this book by charles darwin , the orig@@ in of the species and the ance@@ st@@ or of man .
that man should come from the mon@@ keys , and , yes , it was a common ance@@ st@@ or between people and mon@@ keys .
and then she ran her to her husband , and she said , well , that &apos;s not what charles &apos;s writing there .
the person should come up from mon@@ keys or have a common ance@@ st@@ or .
no , no , it &apos;s not going .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to stop that people get exper@@ ti@@ se about it .
why do we need to prevent people &apos;s skills from something when it &apos;s true ?
because without this life , we can &apos;t live without this life .
because we can , that feeling , to be great , to be great , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the highest beings , not from such a point of view , from something un@@ predic@@ table as an organis@@ m that exists still , and otherwise like things , that &apos;s in@@ ade@@ qu@@ able to us , that it &apos;s in@@ appropriate .
so , we can &apos;t get these things at all .
we need to stop that people are doing skills , especially when they &apos;re true .
so in order to see how slowly this mechan@@ ism comes up and how the tra@@ cks look behind , that it &apos;s going to lead to something else than this magni@@ fi@@ cent picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story to give you another story .
it &apos;s a very beautiful story , as i mean .
and my wife told me .
she came out of school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she was talking about a student .
it &apos;s an au@@ ti@@ stic student .
it may be particularly like it , because he has a tenden@@ cy to the conc@@ ei@@ ve of it .
and she asked him , what are your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es of your ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es
and there he says , you know , i &apos;m at the fire@@ fight .
and since i &apos;m at the fire , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ ma@@ tural things .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re hot at that point , there &apos;s something wrong . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , always , if a human being in a moral re@@ view , the surge@@ on is used , that we should try to replace it through the fur@@ ni@@ ture of the word .
do that once , and then you learn the sentence .
even though i &apos;m attac@@ king at the fire , i &apos;m interested in py@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic things .
you feel , that &apos;s the real truth behind the ground .
a little bu@@ b that doesn &apos;t really care about fire@@ bu@@ ll@@ ens .
it &apos;s really interested in fire@@ ways .
but there is no one where we can look around where you learn how to make fir@@ es .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire@@ men , the fire .
that &apos;s where he refer@@ red to .
and in addition to that , you don &apos;t say his teacher is , you &apos;d like to get bri@@ tin somewhere , and you &apos;re deli@@ gh@@ ted when the fir@@ es are coming up with it .
no , it looks a lot better , when we show that we &apos;re constantly trying to elimin@@ ate the risks that can &apos;t do the other one when they &apos;re doing a fir@@ es .
this is what you have this little mechan@@ ism .
now , these assu@@ mp@@ tions that in the mid@@ side of the bu@@ b already knew that he &apos;s related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t tell it to the fire , but
what you have here is that you have this cen@@ sor between the un@@ conscious , and the conscious one that jum@@ ps immediately without doing something about it , and the things you know that they can look very different for you and others .
and so just like that , we just get these words that we also use in the language of the poli@@ tically cor@@ rect language of language .
in fact , we know that something else is the case .
but we know , when we talk about this , the social conditions are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that just .
it &apos;s impossible , these things in a society that &apos;s supposed to work with .
so i want to explain to you what we &apos;ve discovered in my institute .
in terms of what lo@@ gic , this de@@ ception , the will@@ ing@@ ness , the will@@ ing@@ ness , a different reality than the one , of which we actually know , is that it &apos;s transpar@@ ently bene@@ ficial to spread out
i &apos;m going to show you two , maybe three examples of the examples .
the first example is that many of you know , and some of you appreci@@ ate some of you , very few of them don &apos;t need any of them at all .
i mean , i mean the sou@@ l .
so what &apos;s the sou@@ l ?
the sou@@ l is such a little bit of intellectual , says soft@@ ing@@ ni@@ z .
it &apos;s something that isn &apos;t from ris@@ e , materi@@ al nature .
and if you have people in front of them who are the most convinced that they have a sou@@ l , or you can also say that they believe that they were going from the sou@@ l to live , then they think it &apos;s pre@@ cis@@ ely as if the sou@@ l is such an in@@ san@@ e cor@@ relation about them , not from matter , they &apos;re just from flo@@ wing meat and blood , and whatever it &apos;s a little bit of predat@@ ori@@ ty , reli@@ able , it &apos;s dead , it &apos;s dead , it &apos;s dead , it &apos;s dead , it &apos;s dead , it &apos;s
and from this sou@@ l , you think that somehow you &apos;re sort of in this cloud , in this magni@@ fi@@ cent nature , anim@@ a called it in the la@@ tin , the lo@@ f@@ a@@ sis , the lo@@ f@@ on , the fa@@ f@@ th@@ ingly .
and if that lo@@ pp@@ piece then attra@@ cts about the people , it &apos;s hard@@ filled with dig@@ ni@@ ty , with spirit , with nature that can only live , but just with sou@@ l , too .
and then he can just walk away .
that &apos;s the idea of how the sou@@ l does .
so , she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to percei@@ ve them as something that should possibly be present for our lives .
and if you have that sugge@@ sti@@ on in front of the eyes , then you understand the lo@@ gic that we experience that happiness , through a lie , to make our world better .
because now , you can use a three-@@ sentence .
three out@@ comes , they &apos;re still out of school .
now , this is a three-@@ sentence here , which descri@@ bes us a lo@@ gic .
and that &apos;s the har@@ dest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need a little lo@@ gic , but also to lie with it .
and that &apos;s how to realize that you can just apply this lo@@ gic wrong .
in that three-@@ sentence , three sets of sent@@ ences come from .
the first sentence is , you know , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
so the second sentence is , if it &apos;s right , it doesn &apos;t have sou@@ l .
now , there &apos;s a third sentence .
and i &apos;ve high@@ ligh@@ ted him here .
a third sentence , which appe@@ ars to appear immediately in people who have a very strong sense of a sou@@ l .
those say who doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l , it &apos;s dead , and it can &apos;t be ans@@ wer@@ ed .
and here &apos;s what you feel .
and here comes this lo@@ gic in this one , yes , in this de@@ qu@@ isi@@ te speech , for the expression .
you &apos;re looking at it immediately .
the first two sent@@ ences , they &apos;re logi@@ cal .
i can say everything else .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make stat@@ ement about the reality .
i can say , the can@@ ni@@ t is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , that &apos;s a man &apos;s law .
if i don &apos;t get right , then the can@@ di@@ date is not a man .
the lo@@ gic doesn &apos;t make a cla@@ im about what is true .
i can cla@@ im everything .
but cru@@ cial , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so , if sound says , there &apos;s no sou@@ l .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a sou@@ l .
these things are logi@@ cally accu@@ rate .
and now we feel our no@@ verage of consciousness immediately , and this is something you can do .
it depen@@ ds on a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sent@@ ences , and that &apos;s what makes the opposite of the first sentence , and that &apos;s what it does like the opposite line
because , in fact , we have to prove if or not it &apos;s the sou@@ l or not .
but with this lo@@ gic , which just uses that two sent@@ ences are logi@@ cally cor@@ rect , and a third of it depen@@ ds on a third that looks like it has something to do with it , so that we can save our life@@ gro@@ ws .
so , we &apos;re very impossible to be able to be able to live without a sou@@ l alive .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things in different examples of examples .
in the pres@@ ence of how we have a very modern example , this is what kee@@ ps the day and again and again .
and this is what you have to do is another philosop@@ hi@@ cal top@@ ic , a l@@ ength of the philosoph@@ y of philosoph@@ y , pre@@ ten@@ ding .
and that has to do with that we go back to the four@@ -@@ year century .
there was a sch@@ ol@@ ars , which was named jo@@ han@@ nes bu@@ ri@@ dan@@ us , and after that , the bu@@ ri@@ t@@ ar es@@ el named .
the bu@@ cky es@@ el is an es@@ el that &apos;s made from a nature of nature .
it didn &apos;t have that sou@@ l .
it &apos;s such a natural thing .
and if you place exactly the ex@@ act same in the middle between two of the size of the h@@ arb@@ or , it ten@@ ds to be cle@@ am@@ ed .
because he doesn &apos;t know what the number of things should go at first .
so , he &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how nature is pres@@ ented .
immedi@@ ate power with compar@@ ison pres@@ ent@@ ement shows to each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you get another example , so if you immediately make them a little bit bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and it doesn &apos;t need any reason to do it .
auto@@ matically , it &apos;s auto@@ matically going to be the right idea .
and if you have this idea that you &apos;re sort of thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed in nature , you &apos;re being invented , you know , from the big dots that you just pick up immediately , you have to feel the feeling that there has to be something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re in frank@@ fur@@ t , we &apos;re at the subject , i remember the ma@@ x plan@@ c@@ r institute for brain science .
there &apos;s a law@@ yer called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and he &apos;s called wol@@ f sing@@ er , and he says , &quot; well , wol@@ f sing@@ er says , there &apos;s no wel@@ f@@ are freedom .
now we can form the second sentence again and say , if wol@@ f sing@@ er has right , he doesn &apos;t have any freedom of freedom .
these sent@@ ences are absolutely logi@@ cal , and cor@@ rect .
and so what we can read for almost every day in the day , that &apos;s what you find in this third sentence .
it looks something that doesn &apos;t look something that doesn &apos;t have aids freedom , but it can be re@@ moved for its actions and cla@@ ims to the responsi@@ bilities , and it &apos;s therefore un@@ competi@@ tive .
again , here you have it again .
in fact , the first thing you need to do is to prove if there &apos;s something like sex freedom .
but the lo@@ gic of de@@ ception allows us to do that as if the first sentence of the bottom is wrong , as if you have to predict the opposite without understanding , you should have to
and now , you can just , if you want to do something yourself , if you want to do something , and most of all , if you want to enjoy people happy , that &apos;s the coura@@ ge to lie .
practice this , for example , if you just meet a person you can say , there &apos;s no predic@@ tors .
and please don &apos;t use the ger@@ man word for predic@@ t@@ ary , which is called prop@@ he@@ t .
you don &apos;t want to call that , that would be a little bit more poli@@ tically cor@@ rec@@ ted again .
you say , there &apos;s no predic@@ tors .
immediately , they become one of those predic@@ tors , and they &apos;ll be experi@@ en@@ cing one of those cases , and you can &apos;t prove that .
and they &apos;ve already got a problem .
because while you &apos;re enga@@ ged with it , that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no predi@@ ction , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it , because he &apos;s dre@@ wed them .
because he has led them on a bar@@ re@@ l that he doesn &apos;t es@@ cape himself .
because , in fact , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s only interested in making himself stand up with the need of the need to prove that there is predic@@ tors .
so , in terms of the scale of evidence , they experience the magni@@ fi@@ fic@@ ity of lying .
and once you have a chance again , if you have a chance to feel this three-@@ sentence in other people , do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy things , if they don &apos;t remember them .
thank you very much for your attention .
yeah , good after@@ noon .
and i was allowed to ask li@@ l@@ ly if i could mention them .
and she &apos;s one of the subje@@ c@@ tors here from this magni@@ fi@@ cent meeting , and asked me if i &apos;m going to give you a lec@@ ture here and i &apos;m going to give my idea .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got to say , you know , i &apos;ve got hard to talk about my idea .
and i might like to introdu@@ ce my in@@ t project that i &apos;m trying to show you .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum of a lot , a lot of ideas .
i &apos;m probably going to be there , though , the two nice girls are there , i &apos;m probably going to be the generation that has been given for this bad ear , because i &apos;ve already started studying a hundred hundred years ago in kar@@ ck@@ s@@ ru@@ v , technical school , i think , i think , k@@ it .
and i came up to ber@@ lin in the mi@@ d-@@ 198@@ 0s , because i wanted to do rene@@ w@@ able energi@@ es , and that wasn &apos;t ru@@ b@@ bling .
there were the core explor@@ ation of le@@ o@@ bo@@ d@@ sha@@ pers .
that was all the k@@ f@@ a , the je@@ wish was called k@@ f@@ a , too .
now , the names of the project fa@@ kes today .
because a good engineer is either built beautiful cars , or nuclear power production .
but that do@@ o@@ f@@ es like &quot; n solar pen@@ del , &quot; just a hundred wat@@ ts out of the square meter , that was a to@@ y .
and in ber@@ lin , there was a crazy engineering communic@@ ant .
i &apos;m gr@@ ate@@ ful to the pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , that he had rec@@ ili@@ ated the word again again , because after the light , you didn &apos;t have to use the word anymore , because all the links was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t like that in the 198@@ 0s , it wasn &apos;t
and there it was that there was a human@@ -@@ trained opportunity , and one of them sitting in cros@@ se@@ berg in the number of trials , where you sus@@ pe@@ cted the bad one .
place of terror@@ ism , but that was called el@@ tr@@ on@@ ics , and has made wind and solar power , and that &apos;s where i started in the middle of the ei@@ gh@@ ence .
and yes , a lot of what i &apos;ve said today is that , because a lot of , many , many beautiful stat@@ ements that i &apos;ve been living through .
i worked in the collective years of doing 11 years , which was sc@@ al@@ si@@ zed .
we were tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ old people .
if one said no one was the v@@ et@@ op@@ c@@ r , which has been completely s@@ mil@@ ing , and i &apos;ve been hard for 10 years , and i &apos;ve been hard to dou@@ ble@@ ly re@@ je@@ ct whether i &apos;m really going to have my great engineering study , because all the colleagues of my father always taught him , you &apos;ve had the money going out on the window with your kid .
it &apos;s really concerned with hu@@ mili@@ ty .
and it was really , really bit@@ ter , and then you get into a do@@ zen phase , and you &apos;d get it in a bit of the time , and where i asked myself after 10 years ago , a thousand mar@@ row that was , of course , in the collective , in the collective , of course , in the collective , of course , that this really should be the great thing .
and i stopped up until six and six years ago , and then we &apos;ve become a co-@@ fo@@ under of the company &apos;s company , which then has become the sp@@ in off heli@@ -@@ class , which is one of the largest cell makers in the world .
an enormous story , but also since we have , of course , we have the problem of a growing corpo@@ ration , and we have two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -@@ six , a small group , decided that we &apos;ve started small , a small group , we decided that we started small , and i think that &apos;s the same thing , and we think it &apos;s sort of crazy , so that &apos;s when people say , what &apos;s going to do is , we &apos;re talking about food . we &apos;re talking about food .
and that &apos;s where i brought you a project that i want to introdu@@ ce you now .
and the ti@@ tle of the talk was , yes , how to get to a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and we just started asking with a very simple story , which is , where could you be using a memory of a good sense of purpose today .
on this island , this is the island of gra@@ c@@ o@@ sa on the a@@ z@@ ury .
yes , that &apos;s the data that is like this .
and there are four and a half thousand people .
they have a rene@@ w@@ able energy addi@@ ction today of five percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have any more ?
it doesn &apos;t just go technologi@@ cally .
and if you build more wind power , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m always talking about that as well as the politicians in ber@@ lin@@ -@@ ad@@ per@@ sh@@ ein , which is our facili@@ ty .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we &apos;ve already had 20 percent in germany now .
i can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not , we have seven percent in europe , and our networks are physi@@ cally the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we &apos;d have to have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , and it was two-@@ quar@@ tages of 2006 , and the first cont@@ acts started with the island , just taking it through .
how big would be such a battery , so you can actually have an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 40 , 40 , maybe even more 80 percent rene@@ w@@ able .
and yeah , i &apos;m going to go up with a slide .
the conven@@ tional system looks like this everywhere in the world .
and by the way , about a hundred gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts , there are about a hundred of the gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of electrical power on the world .
this is the power of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s very rapi@@ dly all over the world .
the energy hunger in the world , which is going on , is being er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated with this el , because you don &apos;t need an exc@@ it@@ u@@ ment .
this is quick .
you take po@@ les go like this .
and then it looks like this , it looks like this .
three of these , two of these guys , two of them are always wa@@ ited .
yeah , this is what it looks like down there is the bur@@ den .
we &apos;ve also gotten very deta@@ g@@ ly data .
and the wind plant , or the solar plant , or whatever it is , is basically a back@@ -up system , a system that can only be stor@@ ed in small amo@@ unts of places .
and our goal was just to say , okay .
the same whe@@ el is going on and wind , and the wind , you harv@@ est the load so that you can form the greater frag@@ ments .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent rene@@ w@@ ables , you want energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the same c@@ el .
that is , in the very moment , you have to make the rene@@ w@@ ables to be able to take the whole network .
you can only , of course , if you &apos;re familiar in some way , you can only be familiar with this .
that &apos;s what no one has done in the world .
that &apos;s what makes you in a small style , so you can also serve your r@@ asi@@ ers on a small con@@ tradi@@ ction , and you can also
people are always asking me , what did you actually do in ad@@ per@@ sh@@ in ?
well , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to put together several of these organizations , and they want to build a net , it becomes very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 9@@ 0,000 to nin@@ e-@@ year-@@ 5 percent rene@@ w@@ able , and then there will be this rest , the last rest of the last 10 , 20 percent rene@@ w@@ able , that &apos;s going to be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s going to be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work either that you &apos;re out of bat@@ ter@@ ies .
that &apos;s definitely a energy wand , which then , hydro@@ gen , me@@ than@@ e , me@@ than@@ e , power to gas , you know , that &apos;s going to be .
they have to be more likely to go to a seas@@ onal and winter summer , not just the shor@@ tage of we@@ tty night .
we just wanted to know , which is because of a normal , p@@ is@@ h electro@@ chemical battery .
how far are you going to be there at all ?
and then they created a whole bunch of simu@@ lations of the simu@@ lations .
and the wind and the sun and the load and the load came to the conclu@@ sion , a very exciting effect that you &apos;ve got to go through the conven@@ tional system , which takes a middle colum@@ let , which takes a quar@@ ter of about five years per kil@@ o@@ watt hour , is coming out of four and a half cents per kil@@ o@@ watt hour , is coming out of a four@@ -@@
these were the very first calcu@@ lations six years ago .
and then we said , okay , yeah .
yeah , here &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re che@@ aper like the same cost of the cost of five percent a year .
and then we started negoti@@ ated with the insu@@ ps .
what needs to be done ?
so with inv@@ e@@ stors , i &apos;ve cho@@ sen new crimin@@ ors , i &apos;ve been looking for new offi@@ ci@@ ers .
we were only five people at the time to re-@@ re@@ build the society .
and then again , here &apos;s the visu@@ alization again .
the brown is sort of the conven@@ tional system , the green culture is our system .
that our system also has a price , is because we &apos;re now doing 20 percent with dies@@ el , and we &apos;re not going to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate the other things , and we &apos;re not going to
and the power@@ -@@ u@@ tili@@ ty , which is the driving power companies on the island , has changed , we find a great thing .
let &apos;s also support support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
and therefore , we decided that we decided to build a hall in ber@@ lin , in which we can actually form the electrical circu@@ its of the island in scale one to three very accu@@ ra@@ tions .
so , we &apos;ve looked at the first time to find the largest battery of the world .
here it is .
and it comes naturally from asia , in which case from japan , in terms of japan .
and ama@@ z@@ ingly , in the &apos; 9@@ 0s , it &apos;s been developed by b@@ b@@ c , who &apos;s been developed now , and it &apos;s been developed by the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery of battery .
it has a me@@ ga@@ watt &apos;s performance , and it can make six hours for this performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of re@@ stor@@ ative technology .
and then they put them up .
we also have one of these same big ag@@ gre@@ gate in the same size as it is there , put in the hall of fact , in fact , the complete dynamic behaviors of this network , so that &apos;s what it looks like now , there &apos;s the same whe@@ el , here &apos;s the big battery , and here &apos;s the kind of big battery , there &apos;s all the re@@ vie@@ ws that we &apos;re explor@@ ing with the net .
and over here , we simu@@ late the entire trans@@ mission system , the miles of the c@@ able , the miles of the c@@ able to sort of create the vi@@ bra@@ tion behavior in the web .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also turn up two hundred kil@@ o-@@ wat@@ ta@@ ics onto the net .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is , again , again , again , again , the guy again , single ag@@ gre@@ gation .
and what we &apos;ve done , since two-@@ 40 nine years ago , has been comple@@ ted , until two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -@@ 12 t@@ wel@@ pers are exactly what &apos;s going on here between the single system of electr@@ on@@ ics to build software , we &apos;ve done .
so we &apos;re not a bat@@ e@@ makers , but we &apos;re reali@@ zing as a company that &apos;s only between the theme of battery and the top@@ ics , and everything in between .
you have to communicate on the battery , you have to be able to be able to communicate in the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing is , in this island , you can basically take it all the way out of this island today that we &apos;re going to get to , if we want to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ ables , to increase our share of rene@@ w@@ ables .
so this whole discussion , as we move and moving , energy shif@@ ts , energy shif@@ ts , as it should go , on the island , we have five to 30 percent accu@@ rate energy , so we &apos;re cool@@ ing the wind , and the sun &apos;s rules .
natural light then puts smar@@ t-@@ electri@@ fied mes@@ h .
so bright power , a huge top@@ ic everywhere .
we can actually start to integra@@ te electro@@ mo@@ bility , ask them to question electro@@ mo@@ bility , because you can manage the lo@@ oms .
that means that if you &apos;re 90 percent rene@@ w@@ able , you &apos;re not going to do that without ste@@ ering .
you can do it by n smar@@ t@@ ings , you can reduce your nets , yes , you should listen to the frag@@ ments , but you &apos;re never going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and that &apos;s the message that &apos;s the message .
so also , a lot of people come and look at it , except because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the same c@@ el , then you don &apos;t have these ro@@ tat@@ ing mass that cause some kind of in@@ er@@ ti@@ a on the grid .
and our european connec@@ ty network is basically just from l@@ oud ro@@ tat@@ ing mas@@ ses of big power plants , wher@@ ever the wave is changing all around europe .
and we &apos;re looking into this network , you see the 500 her@@ tz , and when it &apos;s nine of the com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive com@@ k nine her@@ tz , we &apos;re going to start up a couple of val@@ ts , then a little bit of a mountain ste@@ am , and then we &apos;re going to come back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredibly custom@@ i@@ zed .
if you st@@ ack that somewhere , it &apos;s just going to take it .
the u@@ ter@@ ated reser@@ ve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time , they can respond to other things .
and if you don &apos;t have that , these ro@@ tat@@ ing mass , then you have to replace this with venti@@ lation , and electro@@ chemistry .
and we can turn up two milli@@ seconds with this big battery of two milli@@ seconds .
and that &apos;s where you see what enormous levels of levels are there .
and the message is , what we need to do is we need to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate these ro@@ tat@@ ing sc@@ ales , and we have to sort of get our tar@@ gets , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to achieve them all at all .
and then we have to break our bra@@ stories on the net , we need to break our bra@@ stories on the
and mu@@ d-@@ ward is simply called the power station , to keep the frequ@@ ency of the frequ@@ ency .
yes , it &apos;s a huge debate right now , using the cooking power plants , because we don &apos;t either , or ga@@ stur@@ pe@@ es , because that &apos;s not going .
and what we &apos;re trying to do is to just clear that you can reduce the capacity of the capacity , the mu@@ d-@@ end capacity , by putting electro@@ chemical stor@@ age into the net .
and there &apos;s a whole lot of studies that are very lucky now .
and in order to do that , people come and look at our experiment@@ al subje@@ ct , sort of our first subje@@ ct test .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a piece of the future there .
and a lot of discus@@ sions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years of photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics in the past 30 years .
it &apos;s not sh@@ in@@ able , it &apos;s a child game game , we &apos;ve got everything , it &apos;s never fig@@ uring .
we have 3@@ ength of gi@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of ultra@@ vol@@ ta@@ a in germany .
so that &apos;s the real thing .
and i &apos;m just going to leave that in the next three years , we &apos;re going to have the same capacity of electro@@ chemical stor@@ age all over the world .
very simple , this is how it &apos;s going to happen .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of resi@@ stance and argu@@ ments .
and the nice thing is that i &apos;ve found so much in the last two years that the scientists are going to stand on my side .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million direc@@ tors of concent@@ r@@ ation , and we &apos;ve now got about 10 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t battery now to clim@@ b the ger@@ man net .
this will be done in apri@@ l next apri@@ l .
so , of course , you realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only about this waste of defen@@ se to the idea , to the idea , a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , yes , is yes .
and if you have a hundred percent rene@@ w@@ able , it &apos;s like a kind of a system of a system .
so far , in discus@@ sions , these insu@@ ps , these insu@@ ps , they do the o@@ ye@@ k , they have a little net , and it has nothing to do with our de@@ fau@@ lt and nothing .
the question , though , is very simple if you &apos;re totally independent of any fossil or ur@@ an@@ ces of energy , which are thro@@ wn out anywhere in the world and being killed to them , and you &apos;re an island .
and then they just use what &apos;s there on the sun and wind there , where they live .
and that &apos;s sort of a little bit of our vision of a reas@@ on@@ able energy , and i &apos;m very gr@@ ate@@ ful to cra@@ d@@ le to cra@@ d@@ le that they said , &quot; solar power . &quot;
and that &apos;s what we do , and we get this as well , the talk of pre@@ mi@@ um col@@ a , that you can be a collective and use solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit together , and here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encoura@@ ge you , in the sense that you can be quie@@ t , in the sense that you can be quie@@ t and have a vision of it .
and you really have to stay really tough in it , but i think that &apos;s going on .
thank you very much .
when steve lo@@ pe@@ z , col@@ an was the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he was listening to a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a afri@@ can@@ -@@ american , sym@@ path@@ ic , ra@@ u , hom@@ eless , who played on a vi@@ o@@ lin who had only had two str@@ ings .
many of you will know the story , because of ste@@ fis@@ y artic@@ les , later , a book that was fil@@ med again , with robert dow@@ ney j@@ uni@@ or as steve lo@@ pe@@ z and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel anth@@ ill@@ or , the con@@ test that studied at the ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ an conser@@ v@@ atory and his promis@@ ing career was early by his par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ de schizophren@@ ia early by his par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ de schizophren@@ ia .
na@@ than@@ iel left ju@@ il@@ les leaving ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , and 30 years later , he lived as hom@@ eless on the streets of sk@@ id row at the center of los angeles row at the center of
i re@@ com@@ men@@ d all of you to read ste@@ ves book , or to look at the movie , so that they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connec@@ fac@@ tion that was developed between these two men , but also how the music needed that connection , and how she finally was the instrument , when this interpretation allows me to get the mi@@ th@@ al@@ f , na@@ than@@ iel rou@@ ge from the street .
i met m@@ r a@@ wis@@ s in 2008 , two years ago , in wal@@ t dis@@ ney , hall .
he had just heard of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first demon@@ stration of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and the fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very hot and ha@@ tty clay about yo@@ -@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton , and how the do@@ d@@ gers would never make it into the google world series , and all of that because of the t@@ unt pas@@ sage of the first vi@@ o@@ lin , bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ ph@@ ony .
we came to talk to the theme of music , and a few days later , i got an email , saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in me .
i have to mention that na@@ than@@ iel er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electric sho@@ cks and with th@@ or@@ a@@ zine and hand@@ bag@@ s , a trau@@ ma that followed his whole life .
now , as a result of it , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable for these schizophren@@ ics , and they &apos;re so bad , and he disappe@@ ars dan@@ dly , and he disappe@@ ars , in the streets of sk@@ id row , going around the streets of sk@@ id row , and he &apos;s ex@@ posed to the tor@@ ri@@ on of his own spirit .
and in fact , in the same time , na@@ than@@ iel was , when we started at wal@@ t dis@@ ney at the wal@@ t of the wal@@ t dis@@ ney hall , and he started having this er@@ ror fli@@ ck@@ ers in his eyes , and completely limited .
he was talking about invisible con@@ mp@@ ts and smo@@ ke , and how he wanted to miss someone in the sle@@ eping .
i was fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , but i was fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , but i was afraid that i could lose it into one of his circum@@ stances , and that i could destro@@ y him his relationship to the vi@@ o@@ lin , when i started talking about glass and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ da@@ stic g@@ il@@ ing .
so , i just started to play .
i played the first sentence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s in@@ struc@@ tions .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in na@@ th@@ ani@@ a &apos;s eyes , vision was going on a complete change .
it was as if he was under the impact of a invisible ar@@ z@@ ne@@ i , a chemical response , whose cat@@ aly@@ st was my game .
na@@ th@@ ani@@ a &apos;s man@@ her shif@@ ted in understanding , into a quie@@ t curi@@ osity and aff@@ power@@ ment .
and as a mira@@ cle , he as@@ sum@@ ed his vi@@ o@@ lin , and he started playing some cli@@ ps of the in@@ ert conc@@ ert , and he asked me to play her : musli@@ verti@@ s@@ son , t@@ bo@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sk@@ i , si@@ dr@@ li@@ us .
and we then started talking about music , starting from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven , bra@@ h@@ ms , bru@@ t@@ ters and all the rest of us , from bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ c@@ ka sal@@ at@@ ons .
and i realized that he was not just an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia knowledge about music , but it was a very close personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and understanding that i was only aware of my colleagues in the phil@@ harmon@@ y of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , it was from this par@@ an@@ o@@ i@@ an , conf@@ used man , who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a lo@@ aded , educ@@ ated , exc@@ ell@@ ent , in ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard &apos;s trained musi@@ cians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
so for na@@ than@@ iel , music means sin@@ d-@@ vas@@ cular health .
because music allows him to form his thoughts and ir@@ oning with its imagination and in@@ ju@@ ries with creativity into something real .
and so he &apos;s doing his se@@ arch@@ ing confli@@ cts .
and i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
that &apos;s why we make music : so that we make something that &apos;s deep inside of all of us , deep inside , our emotions , through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity .
and the reality of that expression comes all of us , and moving , inspired , and helps us .
what na@@ than@@ iel went , so the music brought him back to a community of friends .
the up@@ coming power of music brought it back into a family of musi@@ cians who understood his talent and saw him .
and i &apos;m going to add up with na@@ than@@ iel music , whether in the wal@@ ch of dis@@ ney , room or sc@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me why i became a musi@@ cian .
thank you very much .
br@@ un@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i want to play a little bit of the c@@ elli@@ sts , which i &apos;m most ama@@ zed to do with the c@@ elli@@ sts .
i hope you &apos;ll give me comfort .
so , in my life , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish .
i just loved two of them .
this first one , that was more like a passionate mon@@ key .
it was a beautiful fish , fra@@ c@@ tious , good consi@@ sten@@ cy , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , a red s@@ eller on the men@@ m card .
which is a fish .
even better , he was raised in a@@ qu@@ at@@ ul@@ ture after the most con@@ vail@@ ing standards of sustain@@ ability .
so you could feel like you could be selling it .
i had this beauty with a different time of a different time .
and one day , the director of the company called asking , and asked if i could do it at a event about the sustain@@ ability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what has become this un@@ belie@@ vable problem for our che@@ fs , how do we re@@ f@@ are fish on our foot@@ cards ?
in the last 50 years , we have fis@@ her@@ ed the ocean as we &apos;ve be@@ aten the wh@@ ale ca@@ in .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ wh@@ rate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones that we love , the tun@@ as , the hot bu@@ ll@@ s , the la@@ kes , sh@@ ells , they &apos;re collap@@ sed .
there &apos;s almost no more left .
so , it &apos;s going to be a b@@ loo@@ dy a@@ qu@@ ac@@ a , fis@@ her@@ arian , fis@@ her@@ ies , part of our future .
a lot of argu@@ ments , fis@@ lations of fis@@ her@@ ers , have damage the environment most of them , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , take tun@@ a . a huge deal .
he has 15 to one in a 15 to one
that means 15 pounds of wild fish are requi@@ red so that you get a po@@ und tun@@ a .
not very sustain@@ ably .
don &apos;t sha@@ ke very well .
so , finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
and i wanted to support them .
so the day before that , i called the director of the public work for the company .
let &apos;s call it it .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to get it out of the sea , that you &apos;re not going to cont@@ amin@@ ate the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish is distribu@@ ted , not concent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded up , &quot; we are basically a world of a world .
this supp@@ le@@ ment of about 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best thing in the industry . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2,@@ 5 to one thing ? what are you consum@@ ing ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said , &quot; i said . &quot;
and that ev@@ ening , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i was calling the next day , just before the event , i said , &quot; don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; no , what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to ask questions .
now , i used a bunch of people in the company , no one could give me a very awful answer , until i finally started to tele@@ and tele@@ phone with the bi@@ ologists .
let &apos;s call him as well as well .
and i said , &quot; don i say , &quot; what , for example , are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ e , and some fishing me@@ gs , and then he said , chicken p@@ el@@ lets .
and i said , &quot; chicken p@@ el@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , bone fl@@ ams , cor@@ respon@@ ds to food and feed . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your life &apos;s food is chicken ? &quot;
in the assu@@ mption of maybe two percent of them .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable about getting chicken to fish in fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i de@@ com@@ red to this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a more confi@@ dent pleas@@ ure and good person .
that &apos;s me , even .
no , i actually fell through this fish , because , i swe@@ ar at god , who &apos;s s@@ hr@@ ying fish after this conversation after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic way , the way you know your fish , you learn your fish , you love the fish more .
i first ate him in a restaurant in southern spa@@ in first .
a long journ@@ alist had spo@@ ken from this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of po@@ uring us in a way .
he came up on the table with a bright , sort of s@@ warm white color .
the che@@ f had co@@ ok it .
let &apos;s go twice .
ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly , he was still deli@@ cious .
who can make a fish so well , after he &apos;s being co@@ yed ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el . in fact , he says mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and it &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least in the way that you and i can understand .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at v@@ et@@ a la pal@@ ma .
this is a hole up in the south western corner of spa@@ in .
it &apos;s near the co@@ s@@ light of the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ allo@@ vi@@ r .
up until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of ar@@ gent@@ ina .
they were bur@@ ned on meat c@@ attle , which were basically we@@ t@@ lands .
they were doing that by de@@ pos@@ iting the country .
they built this complicated ep@@ iso@@ de of chan@@ n@@ els , and they forced water out of the country and out into the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t worry that this works , not econom@@ ically .
and o@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally , it was a cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds around , which is a lot of birds for this place .
and this is how 198@@ 2 bought a span@@ ish company with environ@@ ment@@ ality in 198@@ 2 .
what did they do ?
they have rever@@ se the flow of the water .
they literally put up the le@@ vers .
instead of suggest@@ ing water , they use the chan@@ n@@ els to go back to the water .
they swi@@ t@@ ched the chan@@ n@@ els .
they created a 1@@ 1,000 ac@@ re fishing -- bar@@ g , can@@ a@@ ks , gar@@ ks , sh@@ ri@@ mp , a@@ al , a@@ al , a@@ al -- and that &apos;s where mi@@ gu@@ el and his company completely rever@@ se .
the farm is un@@ belie@@ vable .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they &apos;re star@@ ing out on the hori@@ zon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are covered chan@@ n@@ els and those den@@ sity , ab@@ und@@ ant rop@@ es .
i hadn &apos;t been there for mi@@ gu@@ el for a long time .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three pieces of charles darwin and a part of &quot; a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le to the k@@ is@@ s . &quot;
okay ? so there we are , and we thre@@ aten us through the we@@ t@@ lands , and i &apos;m swi@@ mming and swi@@ mming , and i &apos;ve got ma@@ ts@@ ch up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el is going to be a biology lec@@ ture .
this is a rare head@@ way coming up with a rare flas@@ h .
now , he mentioned the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
and here , here he is looking at a pattern of b@@ und@@ i that remin@@ ds him to the tanz@@ ani@@ an gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it turns out that mi@@ gu@@ el has spent the most part of his career in mi@@ k@@ ab@@ i national park in africa .
and i asked him how he became such a fish experts to do this .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an exper@@ t for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and roll@@ s in more sounds of rare birds and al@@ ga@@ e and deli@@ cious water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , this was really amazing , you know , the bio@@ tic community , in the way that it was , in the way
it &apos;s a@@ wes@@ ome , but i was in love .
and my head became we@@ ak about this ha@@ sty piece of deli@@ cious fis@@ her@@ y that i had at the end of the night .
so i sig@@ ned him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , how is it that your fish beha@@ gh@@ ted so well ? &quot;
he showed up on the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , boy , the al@@ ga@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fis@@ her@@ ers eat ?
how is the food condi@@ tion@@ ing ? &quot;
well , he continu@@ es to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat , what they would eat in the wil@@ der@@ ness .
the plant bio@@ mass , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , which is what the fish f@@ ends .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s entirely self-@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
there isn &apos;t a food .
anyone ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
and later , one day i went around with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that appe@@ ars to be so natural , &quot; unlike every farm that i had ever been in , &quot; how do you make success ? &quot;
and the moment it was , it was like a film change would have to have a pu@@ t shift .
and we were hit@@ ting around the corner , and we got the most incredible vision , thousands and thousands of ap@@ red fl@@ amin@@ gos , and a single pin@@ k of car@@ pet will keep the eye as far as the
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your be@@ a@@ ks , p@@ ink .
they &apos;re s@@ hr@@ ying . &quot;
sh@@ ells ? i was totally conf@@ used .
and i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , don &apos;t you s@@ halt your fish ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; yes , he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and fishing mol@@ es to the birds .
well , last year , there were 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 birds , more than 250 different species , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become the largest one today , and one of the most important private bird reser@@ ves have become all of europe .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a good bor@@ ing bird , not the last thing you want to do on a fish ? &quot;
he sha@@ ke his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building stron@@ si@@ dly , not inten@@ se .
this is an e@@ col@@ o@@ gical network .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos fres@@ ses the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp s@@ ells the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
so , the lim@@ b is the better the system better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s re@@ think that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that contro@@ ls their success on the health of their her@@ ri@@ sts .
clean a fish , but also a bir@@ d-@@ reser@@ ve .
oh , and by the way , these fl@@ amin@@ gos should not even be there at the bottom .
they &apos;re sle@@ eping in a city 2@@ 40 kilometers , where the ground is better for the nest ma@@ inten@@ ance force .
every morning , they fly 2@@ 40 miles to the farm every morning .
and every night , they fly in 2@@ 40 kilometers .
they do that because they can follow the l@@ inn@@ ed white line of a@@ 90 a@@ 9@@ 2 .
seriously , seriously .
and i took myself some sort of a little bit of the penguins , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
and i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do you fly 2@@ 40 miles to the farm , and fly them 2@@ 40 miles on the ev@@ ening ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , like i had just quot@@ ed a song by whit@@ ney &apos;s hou@@ ston .
he said , &quot; no . you &apos;re doing that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fis@@ ned , which was deli@@ cious , and i don &apos;t like fish . i don &apos;t like them cr@@ ying . i don &apos;t like them cr@@ us@@ h-@@ forward .
it &apos;s this ob@@ stac@@ le , che@@ cking fla@@ vor .
i almost never do it with it .
and yet , when i tried to do it in southern spa@@ in in southern spa@@ in , she didn &apos;t s@@ hr@@ ink them for a fish .
she was sha@@ king swe@@ et and he was going to take a dopp@@ from the ocean .
i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he kid@@ red .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a spon@@ ge . &quot;
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se before something in the body , before something .
it has developed evolution in the course of evolution to es@@ ph@@ ass un@@ v@@ at@@ u@@ ents . &quot;
and then he ad@@ ded up , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have any resi@@ v@@ als . &quot;
okay . so a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that compar@@ es their success@@ ers to success .
and then i realized that if he says , a farm that has no resi@@ v@@ als , it bur@@ ns enormous , because the water that flo@@ ws through this farm comes from the river gu@@ ad@@ al@@ allo@@ vi@@ r .
it &apos;s a river that causes all the things that are caus@@ ing ri@@ vers today tend to lead them , chemical pollu@@ tan@@ ts , flo@@ ating by p@@ est transplan@@ ts .
and when it &apos;s strug@@ gling through the system , and that leaves that it &apos;s clean , clean than how it came out .
the system is so healthy , it cle@@ ans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that contro@@ ls their success on their own health &apos;s health , but a farm that is literally a water@@ -@@ circu@@ it factory , not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water is flo@@ wing out , it brea@@ ks in the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , as roman@@ tically roman@@ tically , is also em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zing .
you might say that you &apos;re a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about a bar@@ ch or a dise@@ et of clou@@ k .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , of one of which is actually taste in food .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little bit more radical .
we &apos;re not reali@@ stic , we &apos;re fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love street markets . we love small family workers , and we talk about local food . we eat biological bi@@ o .
and if you say that these are the things that the future is for good food , somebody &apos;s going up somewhere and say , &quot; hey , guys , i love p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
may i be honest ?
and i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough cal@@ ories to feed the world more than just fe@@ eding the world .
a billion people are going to be hun@@ gry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the gl@@ ory of the distribution in distribution , not the total production .
now , i don &apos;t like that question , because she &apos;s adop@@ ted the lo@@ gic of our food system for the last 50 years .
pul@@ ling grain from plant food , s@@ wis@@ s use of mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken to the earth , chicken of fish , and all the time the agri@@ cultural industry said , &quot; if we feed more people che@@ aper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
that was the reason . it was the justi@@ fication . it was the business of america &apos;s business plan .
we should call them what it is , a farm in a process , a business that &apos;s going to be a little bit of e@@ col@@ o@@ gical capital that allows exactly this production .
this is not a business , and it &apos;s not far@@ ming .
our kor@@ an cham@@ pi@@ ri@@ c is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of the dec@@ lin@@ ing of resource , but because of exten@@ sion resources .
not by the lat@@ est bar@@ re@@ ment and operation develop@@ ments , but through ferti@@ ent land , not by pu@@ mp , but by fresh water , not by pu@@ mp , but by fresh water , not by the be@@ a@@ ks , not by fishing bo@@ ats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
so they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that can en@@ able every community to feed themselves ?
in order to do that , don &apos;t look at the collapse of the business model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s doing it .
capital , chemistry and machines and machines are in the o@@ ven , and it never made something really good for food .
instead , let &apos;s take a look at the e@@ col@@ o@@ gical model .
that &apos;s what &apos;s re@@ je@@ cted on two billion years of labor .
take a look at mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
businesses that are not worl@@ ds for themselves , oper@@ ators , to re@@ store , rather than comp@@ lies , oper@@ ators , the high-@@ inten@@ se drugs instead of just inten@@ sity , farmers that are not just more produ@@ cated , but experts for relationships .
because they are the people who are experts for fla@@ vor .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better che@@ f than i ever will be .
you know , it &apos;s true , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ cious .
thank you very much .
if i want to talk to you today , the total of the data that we consu@@ me is that the total of the data that we consu@@ me is greater than the sum of your pieces , and instead of thinking about information trans@@ lation , i &apos;d like you to think about how we can use information that we can use , that patterns would not be visible .
so , what we &apos;re looking at here is a typical rock diagra@@ m for age .
so the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ ff@@ t , and what i can do with pi@@ vo@@ t is that i can filter for a certain cause of cause , let &apos;s say acci@@ dents .
and i &apos;ll see a different kind of pattern that is atta@@ ched .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of the middle , people are the most active , and they &apos;re over the most pre@@ cious ones .
we can take a step further and then record the data and see that the data and cancer are the common sus@@ pi@@ ci@@ on and cancer , but not for everyone .
now , when we go forward and look at age age , we &apos;ll say 40 years or yo@@ unger , that acci@@ dents even the main cause is that acci@@ dents should be worried about .
and who &apos;s starting to see that this is actually true in men .
so , what you see is that looking at information and data in this way very much about swi@@ mming in a living information image .
and if we can do that for the ra@@ w data , why not do that for content itself ?
so what we &apos;ve got here are the re@@ vie@@ ws of each single doctor illu@@ str@@ ator , which has ever been prin@@ ted .
it &apos;s all there . it &apos;s all online online .
you can like to test it after my talk in your own pe@@ a@@ ks .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , they can immer@@ se in a decade .
they can immer@@ se in a certain year .
they can ski@@ p directly to a particular copy of expression .
now , when i look here , i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that appear in this stat@@ ement and the spor@@ ts species .
i &apos;m an lan@@ ce arm@@ strong fan , so i click down here by looking at all the subje@@ cts in which lan@@ ce arm@@ strong will be mentioned .
now , if i &apos;d like to get a bigger over@@ view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at it all on the theme of bi@@ cycle ? &quot;
so i go back one step , and i &apos;ll take another view of the perspective .
now , i &apos;m looking at gre@@ g le@@ mond .
and so one idea is that if you go through this kind of information , bri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , bri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , bro@@ cular , zo@@ om down , you zo@@ om out , you don &apos;t just look at or you don &apos;t want to look at it
you do something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s something between it , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i &apos;m going to take this idea a little bit further with about what &apos;s a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is , we took every single wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ d@@ ago and re@@ duced them down to a small sum@@ mary .
the sum@@ mary con@@ tains a short over@@ view and a symbol for the area from which it comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the former , the top of the former som@@ e@@ stri@@ an .
but even in this limit@@ ed view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get an impres@@ sion about the top@@ ics that are the most popular thing on wikipedia .
so i &apos;m going to ele@@ ct the issue of govern@@ ance now .
now , after i ele@@ cted &apos; government , i recognize that the wiki@@ pe@@ di@@ ac@@ at@@ als , who are the most pres@@ sing journ@@ als , who are the most pres@@ cri@@ ption journ@@ als of the year .
this is really important , because this is a reali@@ zation that doesn &apos;t come in a single wiki@@ piece of pe@@ d@@ board .
that &apos;s just going to recognize that when you go back and look at the whole thing .
and in a certain sense of sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can go into the top@@ ic of time magazine , &quot; people of the year , &quot; everybody &apos;s going to see each other .
now , when i look at all these people , i &apos;m reali@@ zing that the majority of government are , some of them come from science . some of them come from science . here &apos;s my bo@@ ss . and one comes from the music do@@ main .
and interest@@ ingly , bon@@ o is also a ted prize w@@ inn@@ er .
so we can now jump off and look at all of the ted prize w@@ inn@@ ers .
you see , we &apos;re sur@@ fing the net for the first time , as if it &apos;s really a web , it &apos;s not just a web , it &apos;s much more abstra@@ ct .
and so i &apos;d like to show you what a little bit of surprise might be .
let me just show you just the new york times , i &apos;ll show you .
pi@@ vo@@ t , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can look at web@@ sites -- and we &apos;re bringing web@@ sites to each single website like this .
so , i can go back one step and jump directly to a specific can@@ di@@ can@@ e .
and this is important because you only look at the web pages in this way , in this way , to look at the entire internet course in the same way .
so , i can zo@@ om in in my field in a particular time .
here &apos;s the state of the entire demon@@ stration that i &apos;ve held to this with this .
and i can sort of get back everything that i &apos;ve been looking at before , and i can get back .
and once i go back one step and i can look at everything , i can &apos;t call my cli@@ ps on my prime past , and here , i &apos;ve cho@@ sen to be ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic , i &apos;m looking for , you know , here &apos;s going to live labor@@ s .
and from here , i can go into the page and bring them back again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s going to be used again , and each time it makes the full picture bigger than the sum of the fil@@ an@@ ces .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a s@@ ale .
we &apos;re talking about the ra@@ in of information &apos;s flight .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; in@@ fl@@ ir@@ able information &quot; in information .
what if we can turn around this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we started able to go from one to the other , and by recogni@@ zing patterns that were otherwise hidden , and by recogni@@ zing patterns that otherwise would have gone to hidden ?
if we can do that , this is going to be going to take a new data of information , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into the information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing knowledge , then maybe we can even take wisdom to it .
so i listen up , thank you very much .
i grew up with a l@@ ung@@ ed science fi@@ ction , and i grew up
in my school , i went to school , every day per hour per hour per hour .
and my nose used to be in a book , a science fi@@ ction book that de@@ dic@@ ated my thoughts into other worl@@ ds , and in telling narra@@ tive , i was satis@@ fied by my deep ones , un@@ sa@@ sting curi@@ osity , in my blog .
and the curi@@ osity also showed that i was not in school , and i was stre@@ aming through the fore@@ sts and gather@@ ed and gather@@ ed &quot; sam@@ ples , &quot; fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ gs and be@@ et@@ water , and all of the microscop@@ e started looking back under the microscop@@ e .
i was a completely science of science , you know .
and it was always about trying to understand the world and sele@@ ct the limit@@ s of the possibility .
and my love for science fi@@ ction appe@@ ared in my environment , because back , in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we fle@@ w to the moon , and i started explor@@ ing the deep sea .
jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au came into our living room with his fascinating shows that would show us animals and places and a world full of wonder that we never could have imag@@ ined before .
now , that &apos;s probably very good for the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction role .
and i was a perfor@@ mer .
i was able to draw . i could paint .
and since there was nei@@ ther video games nor to have these tran@@ scen@@ d@@ ments with computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated movies , all the ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create the pain@@ t@@ ings in my head
we had to all this , and when we were to read a book as children , we took the descri@@ ption of the au@@ ri@@ on and proje@@ cted them on our minds .
my response was to draw and paint from alien , alien worl@@ ds , robots , spac@@ aries and spac@@ ec@@ raft and everything like that .
in math class , i was constantly caught by teachers how i was hi@@ ding , hidden around the text@@ book , drawing around .
creativity somehow had to be out of creativity somehow .
and something interesting happened , and what was interesting about jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au shows me , was the idea of a very un@@ known world here on our earth itself .
certainly , i wouldn &apos;t ever reach an alien world with a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ an world , and it seemed quite un@@ likely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually walk here on , here on the earth , and it was as fascinating and ex@@ o@@ tic as all of the things that i always imag@@ ined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , i was going to be di@@ f@@ ted .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , a half miles away from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
but i didn &apos;t worry about that , but i didn
i was sick of my father , until he finally had made a di@@ ve school in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right on the other side of the bor@@ der where we lived .
i made my di@@ ve in a pool of y@@ m@@ ca in the middle of the winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i just got to the face two years later , when we moved to california , and we &apos;d get to california .
since then , in 40 years now , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours in sub@@ mer@@ si@@
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of deep sea , even in the lower oceans , is so rich to fascinating life , how we really can &apos;t imagine it .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know any boundar@@ ies , in contr@@ ary to our own , very , very , very simple human imagination .
up to today , i find deep a@@ ims for what i see on my di@@ ve .
and my love of the ocean seems to be with the same inten@@ sity and the same inten@@ sity as e@@ f and ever
when i was looking at a prof@@ ession when i was a prof@@ ession , it was fil@@ ming .
so that seemed the best way to tell my inner in@@ cen@@ tions , to tell stories , with my need to create pain@@ t@@ ings .
as a kid , i was writing com@@ ic books , and so on .
so movies have been the way to bring pictures and stories and stories , and the fit together .
of course , the stories that i was looking for , from the sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ ction field : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; and &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
in &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was able to connect my sugge@@ sti@@ on for the under@@ water world , and this is the laun@@ ch of fil@@ ming .
so , like my two passi@@ ons , my two passi@@ ons .
something interesting happened on &quot; ab@@ y@@ ss &quot; : to solve an interesting problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s why we had to create a liquid water@@ way -- we would click on computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g , back .
and the first thing that came out was the first computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated machine figure that ever was seen in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t make any money , exactly he was just playing his production costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience around the world was like h@@ yp@@ no@@ ti@@ zed by the magic that ran from it .
according to ar@@ th@@ ur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law , both advanced technology and magic is no longer distin@@ ct from each other .
so , they saw something ma@@ gical .
and i found that enor@@ m@@ ously exciting .
and i was like , &quot; wow , it &apos;s got to be involved in the movie art . &quot;
so we went in &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; my next movie , even a lot further .
together , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was very liquid , and the success depen@@ ded on how this effect would occu@@
and it worked . again , we had created something ma@@ gical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we played a little bit more money with this film .
looking at these two experiences , a whole new world of creativity has been achie@@ ved , a whole new world of creativity for film .
so i started a company , along with my good friend bi win@@ ston , who was the best ma@@ ke@@ -@@ up and cre@@ at@@ u@@ tter designer , and it was called &quot; digital do@@ main . &quot;
the basic idea of this company was to take the phase of anal@@ er processes with op@@ tical prin@@ ters , etc , and to start with digital produ@@ c@@ ements .
we then did that , and we made a competi@@ tive advantage for a long time .
but in the mid@@ - &apos; 9@@ 0s , we realized that we were in the cre@@ ate and soft@@ er design -- which we actually started fo@@ unded the company , too slowly , began to emer@@ ge .
i had written this piece of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; which should be pus@@ hing the measu@@ poin@@ t@@ ments of visual effects and computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated effects into a whole new hei@@ ghts , with the reali@@ stic human characters that have been created by c@@ ough , and the main fig@@ ures should all be c@@ ute . and the world should be c@@ ute .
but it was a little bit about the sc@@ ore , and the people in my company said that we shouldn &apos;t be able to do this yet .
so i made this , and i made this other movie about the big ves@@ sel that &apos;s going to happen .
the movie studio i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; ro@@ me@@ o and juli@@ a on a ship . &quot; it became a love film epi@@ c , a passionate movie .
but in particular , i really wanted to go down to the real w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know it .
but i &apos;ve convinced them , but i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to the w@@ re@@ ck . we &apos;re fil@@ ming the real w@@ re@@ ck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the movie .
this is enor@@ m@@ ously important . it &apos;s a good herr@@ er for marketing . &quot;
and i per@@ su@@ aded them to fund an expedi@@ tion .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s going back again that your imagination can be a reality .
and then we actually created a reality six months later , a reality where i re@@ turned in a russi@@ an di@@ ve , four kilometers bene@@ ath the surface of the north atlan@@ tic , and i looked at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a bu@@ ll@@ eye .
this wasn &apos;t a film , no h@@ d , that was really real .
so , that really ble@@ w me up .
and the pur@@ suit of prepar@@ ation was enormous . we had to build c@@ ameras and the high@@ lights and all sorts of things .
and what stru@@ ck me was how much of these deep@@ -@@ sea swi@@ t@@ ches were similar to a space mission
well , they were also high-@@ tech and lon@@ ely ex@@ hau@@ ti@@ ve planning .
you get into that cap@@ su@@ le , you go down into this dark , ho@@ sti@@ le environment , where no hope is on res@@ cu@@ e , where you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same thing as if i &apos;m in a science fi@@ ction film .
it &apos;s just really cool . &quot;
i was equ@@ ally obs@@ essed with explor@@ ings of the deep sea .
anyway , one of the things that has to do with curi@@ osity and science . it was everything . it was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was curi@@ osity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood to me .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature , for which we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside the window .
in some of the next expedi@@ tions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in ther@@ mal@@ sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that have never seen before before , and for the science at the time , when we saw them haven &apos;t found any words yet .
so , that &apos;s kind of shif@@ ted me , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a little bit unusual decision .
so after the success of ti@@ tan@@ ic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main career as a film@@ maker in hollywood and i &apos;m going to put a ful@@ l-@@ time resear@@ cher for a while . &quot;
and then we started off , we went to the bis@@ mar@@ ck , and we started explor@@ ing robots with robots .
and we moved back to the w@@ re@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic .
we took little robots to put a fi@@ ber glass c@@ able out of it .
and our inten@@ tion was to go in and look at the air &apos;s inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
nobody had ever explor@@ ed the w@@ ells of the w@@ ells , and you didn &apos;t have any means to do it . so we developed the technology .
now , here i am , on the de@@ ck of the ti@@ tan@@ ic , in a di@@ ve , and i &apos;m looking at plan@@ ks that are quite similar to this ves@@ sel , and i know that once the ta@@ pe has played there , and i know that the ta@@ pe hits there has played there .
and i &apos;m going to fly with a little robot with a little robot in the ship .
and i &apos;m just making it just , but my awareness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physi@@ cally enga@@ ged within the ves@@ sel of the ti@@ tan@@ ic of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
this was the most pre@@ cious shape of a d@@ é@@ j@@ i v@@ u that i had ever experienced , because before i got around a corner , i always knew what was going on in the light of the car , because i was running the movie of the movie , because i was running the movie .
and the crowd was actually a accu@@ rate copy of the ship &apos;s blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts .
so that was a very strange experience of experience .
it made me realize this tele@@ pres@@ ence experience that you use such a robo@@ tic a@@ vat@@ are , and that &apos;s how your consciousness can be able to fit into the vehicle , into this other shape of existence .
it was really extremely profound , really profound .
and maybe a tiny view of what might happen in a couple of decades when you have cy@@ bor@@ g body to explore something or other things , in all sorts of post-@@ human@@ -@@ human@@ s of economics , that i can imagine as a sci@@ en@@ ce-@@ fi@@ tion@@ -@@ fi@@ ction fan .
so after these expedi@@ tions , we started to really learn what we saw down there , like these deep sea animals , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , these are sort of ali@@ ens , but there &apos;s kind of ali@@ ens , but here on the board .
they live with che@@ mo@@ syn@@ thesis , they live .
they don &apos;t exist in a sun@@ light radi@@ al system , as we do .
and this is what you see animals that are right next to a 500 degree centi@@ si@@ us that they can live there .
at the same time , at the same time , i was also interested in space science , and that was also the science fi@@ ction influence from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who &apos;ve been interested in space and who are with nasa , and they &apos;re in nasa &apos;s talk , and they &apos;re planning in the nasa &apos;s talk , and they &apos;re going to russi@@ a , through the mission , running the bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal proto@@ co@@ l all the way down and down , and we &apos;re taking our 3d camera station with it .
and that was fascinating .
but in the end of it , it seemed out that i took space scientists into the deep sea .
and i took them to the world , and i would leave them access to the world : astro@@ bi@@ ologists , planet@@ aries , planet@@ aries , people who &apos;ve been interested in this extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , so that they could take them , and test instru@@ ments and test instru@@ ments , and so on .
and we came up with docum@@ ent@@ ary films , but in fact , science was , in particular , space science .
so the circle between my existence as a science fi@@ ction fan , at the time as a child , and the imple@@ ment@@ ation of the reality .
and in the course of that discovery journey , i &apos;ve learned a lot of them .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you have to think that a director has to be able to lead , a leader like a ship , or something like that .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i was doing these expedi@@ tions .
because at one point , i had to say , &quot; well , what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s the point of this ? &quot;
these stupid movies are not hir@@ ing us a money .
we &apos;re now going to take the cost of the production costs . it &apos;s not
everybody thinks that i was running away between ti@@ tan@@ ic and &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; and i &apos;d had a cele@@ br@@ ated the need@@ ir@@ ars on a to@@ we@@ l somewhere on a beach .
i &apos;ve made all of these films , this docum@@ ent@@ ary film , for a very small audience .
not a ru@@ be , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment that exists . you &apos;re doing it of the discovery of it , and because of the magni@@ fi@@ cent connection that determin@@ es , if a small group of people are forming a team .
because we &apos;ve done all of this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted , and sometimes we &apos;ve been to sea two to three months in la@@ ke .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the a@@ wes@@ ome thing you have in each other , because you &apos;re enga@@ ged with a task that you can &apos;t explain otherwise else .
and if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fi@@ ber@@ glass , the sound slo@@ ce , and that &apos;s the mel@@ m , the sound , the whole technology , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty , the human achie@@ vement , if you &apos;re working on sea , &quot; you can &apos;t just explain the other thing . this is like poli@@ ce@@ men , or by soldiers who &apos;ve done something together and know that you can never explain someone else .
there &apos;s a connection that creates a connection , one more respe@@ ctive respect .
so when i came back to turn my next movie &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you respe@@ cted your team and ear@@ n your respect in the lab .
and so the dynamic was really shif@@ ted .
so i stood back with a small team on un@@ known ter@@ rain , and we got &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; with a new technology that had not been before yet .
enor@@ m@@ ously exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we got to a right family for a four@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years .
it changed my way of making movies , completely .
there were people who thought that we would have done this ocean behavior really well and transpor@@ ted on the planet p@@ and@@ or@@ a .
for me , there was more of a real way of doing my job , the real process that has changed the results .
so , what can we do from all of that ?
what is lessons that we learned ?
i think the first thing is , i think , the curi@@ osity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human fe@@ ature .
and our imagination is a force that can even make a reality .
and the a@@ im of your team is more important than any l@@ or@@ ac@@ ers of the world .
to me , young film@@ makers come to me , saying , &quot; give me an ad@@ vice about how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t worry about yourself .
that &apos;s what dri@@ ves others for you . don &apos;t worry about yourself , don &apos;t stop your own , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a professional sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , and in terms of studying fail@@ ures , fail needs to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a lot of sen@@ su@@ ation there , it &apos;s power@@ s there .
not a big effort that was dem@@ and@@ ing innovation , it was ever appropriate without risk .
you have to be willing to take risks in order to take risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you on the way : failure is an alternative , fear , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today , i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may surprise something because my ful@@ l-@@ time job at the foundation are main@@ ly about vac@@ cin@@ es and sa@@ ps , to the things that we have to inv@@ ent and deliver and deliver the poor@@ est two billion to make a better life .
but energy and climate and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more importantly than any other on the planet .
climate de@@ gra@@ dation means that their presi@@ dents don &apos;t grow over many years , and it &apos;s too much rain , and it &apos;s too little rain , and things are going to change the way that their fra@@ gi@@ le environment can &apos;t hold the environment .
it &apos;s dying to alzheimer &apos;s dying . it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty . it leads to un@@ rest .
so , will climate change is going to be horri@@ ble for them .
and also , the energy activity is very important for them .
in fact , if you could reduce the price of one thing , to obvi@@ ance the price of poverty would be more effective at the bottom of the most effective .
well , the energy activity is wrong over the time .
in fact , the pro@@ gr@@ ession society is based on energy progress .
the co@@ her@@ al evolution is the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very strong case in the electricity cycle , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so we find ourselves in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price half -- get on a new bar@@ rier , and that bar@@ rier depen@@ ds on co2 together .
co2 dri@@ ves the planet , and the equ@@ ation of co2 is actually quite clear .
it redu@@ ces the amount of co2 that leads to temperature incre@@ ases and temperature temperature has some very negative effects , and effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , the indi@@ rect result that the natural eco@@ systems cannot ada@@ pt such a very strong change and collapse together all the systems .
now , the ex@@ act relationship between a carbon increase , and the way of the temperature change , and where their other conditions are , there &apos;s some ambi@@ tions , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambi@@ gu@@ ity about how bad these consequences become , but they &apos;re going to be extremely awful !
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists once , &quot; do we really need to go down to the near zero ?
not half or a quar@@ ter for half or a quar@@ ter ? &quot;
and the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to increase the temperature .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we &apos;ve got a 3@@ .@@ 5 meter tru@@ ck that has to be under a three-@@ foot bridge , and you can just pen@@ et@@ ble in a little bit of it .
here &apos;s what needs to be down , down to zero .
well , we &apos;re doing a lot of carbon dio@@ xide every year , over 26 billion tons of carbon .
each american is about 20 tons . people from the poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow , we have to be able to get change that dri@@ ves that on zero .
it &apos;s been lin@@ ked up .
only a different economic change has changed it at all , and we have to go from being able to re@@ duc@@ ing , and we need to reduce a redu@@ ction to zero .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors . a little bit multi@@ pli@@ cation , you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to bring on the bottom of the number of people , from the services that each person uses in average , from the services that each person can use in average , the average energy for every service and the co2 that is em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit .
so let &apos;s look at each other and think of each other , and let &apos;s think about how we get that on zero .
probably one of these numbers needs to come very close to zero .
now this is the basic al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take it through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today , 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people are alive .
and it goes up to nine billion . that &apos;s going to move up to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vac@@ cin@@ es , health care and re@@ production medicine , we may be able to reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the moment we &apos;re going to see a bar@@ rier about 1.@@ 3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
it depen@@ ds on everything that we eat food , clo@@ thing , television , heat , heat .
and these are very good things and verb@@ al redu@@ ction , which is to make these services available to everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is going up .
in the weal@@ thy world , in the upp@@ er billion , we may be able to se@@ ttle and use less , but on average , that number will go up every year and have more than dou@@ bled , the number of services that are provi@@ ded per person per person .
here &apos;s a very basic service . is there at home , so that you can read the home@@ work ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tas@@ ks under the street light .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s a good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t get up .
because of different success@@ es in the body sector , through other forms of air , through new metho@@ ds , there are a lot of services that they have to reduce some individual services to reduce 90 percent of their own services .
in other services , like making ferti@@ li@@ z@@ ers , 10@@ 5 million : 0@@ 5 : 5@@ 6 : 5@@ 6@@ ,000 -- is hun@@ ting ; 00 8@@ 5 : 5@@ 8@@ ,000 or air traffic , air traffic , is a lot smaller for impro@@ v@@ ements .
in total , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we might be able to reduce a factor of three or maybe a factor of a factor of six .
but in the first three fac@@ tors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to perhaps 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not going to go out .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this will be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s em@@ it@@ ted per energy unit .
it &apos;s a question of whether you can get that on zero .
if you burn char@@ coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost any manufacturing method for electricity is now em@@ power@@ ed co2 , except rene@@ w@@ ables and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy mira@@ cles .
now , if i use the term &quot; mira@@ cle , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mira@@ cle . the p@@ c is a mira@@ cle .
the internet and the services of the services is a mira@@ cle .
people here have contribu@@ ted to the development of a lot of this mira@@ cle .
normally , there &apos;s no de@@ ad@@ line that you need a mira@@ cle to a particular date .
normally , you &apos;re just just wrong and some come from , some of them don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to give full gas , and we get a mira@@ cle in a very short time .
now , i was wondering , how can i really get this up ?
is there a natural illu@@ stration , a demon@@ stration that &apos;s de@@ pic@@ ted to the idea of people here ?
and i remember last year when i took mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os and sort of like people liked this .
and the idea was really sensitive for them , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
so for energy , this stru@@ ck me up here .
i decided that without drin@@ king drin@@ bs , my lat@@ ent contribu@@ tion to the environment would be here .
so here are a couple of natural fire@@ flies .
you &apos;ve in@@ sure me that you don &apos;t pay . you probably don &apos;t even get the glass behind the glass
well , there &apos;s all kinds of play@@ mil@@ ing solutions like these , but they don &apos;t get a lot of a lot .
we need solutions , either one or several who have an un@@ belie@@ vable sc@@ aling and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able reli@@ ability , and even though there are many direc@@ tions where people are looking at , i really see five who can afford these big requi@@ re@@ ments .
i &apos;ve re@@ je@@ cted , po@@ ral , fusion and bio@@ fu@@ els .
they might afford a moder@@ ate contribu@@ tion , and if you do not afford better than i expect , that would be great , but my core stat@@ ement here is that we have to work on all the five things , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they &apos;re having significant problems , because they all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fu@@ els , burning by fossil fu@@ els , burning by micro@@ gas or natural gas .
what you have to do there seems to seem simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to do it . you have to do all the co2 that bur@@ ns out of the sh@@ red@@ ks , and you &apos;re dra@@ pped up under pressure , and you &apos;re just going to dri@@ ll somewhere , and you &apos;re hop@@ ing that it &apos;s
there &apos;s a couple of pil@@ ot@@ ies that make it on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to get to 100 percent , it &apos;s going to be difficult , and it &apos;s going to be a big challenge for the flow of co2 , which is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the sal@@ e@@ set question .
who &apos;s going to make it a chance ?
who can guar@@ an@@ tee something , which is literally a lot of billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from zer@@ o-@@ scale and other things ?
so that &apos;s a lot of volu@@ me .
so , that &apos;s a tough nu@@ t .
the next thing is nuclear energy .
they &apos;ve got three big problems , and the cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries are high , and the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human engagement , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then , what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concern@@ s .
so three very difficult problems that might be solu@@ ble , and that you should be working on it .
and the last three of the five five i &apos;ve cap@@ tured .
it &apos;s the rene@@ w@@ ables of rene@@ w@@ ables , as they often call them .
and also they -- even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they &apos;ve got some re@@ turns .
one is the energy den@@ sity that these technologies are producing dra@@ matically less than power .
these are energy mes@@ ners , you &apos;re talking about a lot of square kilometers , thousands of times more land than a normal power station .
fur@@ ther@@ more , these w@@ ells are inter@@ rup@@ ting .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and it doesn &apos;t seem the wind all the time , and the wind is not going to collapse .
and therefore , if you &apos;re depen@@ dent on these sources , you have to have a way to have a way to get the energy in times , if it &apos;s not available .
so , there are great aids challenges . there are challenges in trans@@ mission , and if we say that the energy source outside of the country is outside , they don &apos;t just need the technology , but they also need to deal with the risk that the energy is coming from where different comes from where different comes from .
and there &apos;s a charge problem problem .
and in order to show the dimension , i &apos;ve got all kinds of bat@@ ter@@ ies that are made , the cars , computers , mobile phones , flas@@ h@@ lights , flas@@ h@@ lights , ti@@ cket lights , for everything . and this is what i &apos;ve found with the amount of electr@@ onic energy that uses the world , and i find that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies that we &apos;re producing are less than 10 minutes of the total of the total energy .
so we need a big break@@ through here , which is something that will be more better for a factor of 100 than the approach@@ es at the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these sub@@ temporary sources about how we &apos;re going to say 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumption .
if you want to get care of 100 percent on it , you need an incredible fan@@ cy battery .
now , where should we go about , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get the dest@@ ination ?
what we need are a lot of companies that work on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need to have at least 100 people .
in a lot of a lot , you &apos;ll say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of us here in the ted group , and i think there &apos;s a lot of people who already work there .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , among other people , one called es@@ ol@@ ar that has great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
vin@@ de k@@ ho@@ s@@ la : invest in do@@ zens of companies that do great things , and have interesting ways , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
na@@ than my@@ hr@@ v@@ old and i &apos;re fund@@ ing a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , follow the nuclear approach .
there are some innova@@ tions in the nuclear sector , mod@@ ular , flu@@ id .
the development has stopped in this industry a little while ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concep@@ ts are around .
the ter@@ ra@@ ma@@ m concept means that instead of a part of the ur@@ ans , one percent , the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , which is u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 .
it &apos;s a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never do reas@@ on@@ ably simu@@ lation , whether it would work , but since there &apos;s modern super@@ computers , you can simu@@ late it and see that , yes ! with the right materi@@ ali@@ stic approach , it looks like it works .
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better to cost the cost of cost .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste waste of today re@@ ac@@ tors as an oper@@ ant .
so instead of breaking on your head , you just burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
the ur@@ an is consum@@ ed by gradu@@ ally , a little bit like a c@@ and@@ le .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of a colum@@ n , often known as a se@@ arch@@ ing wave re@@ actor .
it really dri@@ ves the fuel problem .
so here &apos;s a picture of a hole in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s bur@@ ned today , so it turns out to be a com@@ modi@@ ty of ur@@ an .
the val@@ ves are the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you fil@@ ch ocean water and just filter , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s li@@ fes@@ time .
and you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concep@@ ts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our te@@ stim@@ ine look like ?
now , let &apos;s go until the goal we have to reach , and then we talk about the course of the inter@@ section .
a lot of them talk about 80 percent redu@@ ction to 20@@ 50 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent are going to be created in the poor@@ er countries , and still a little bit of agriculture , and hopefully it will be a clean threat and c@@ ement to be clean to be clean .
so in order to achieve these 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , has completely trans@@ mit@@ ted their electrical generation .
the other note is whether we use the zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest of it .
this is great important .
that &apos;s going to be a key element of this ob@@ stac@@ le .
if we go back from there , how should the 20@@ 20 te@@ stim@@ ony look like ?
it should have kept the two elements again .
we should use the efficiency requi@@ re@@ ment to get re@@ duc@@ tion , and the less we em@@ it@@ ate , the less we will be the carbon sum , and it will also be the temperature .
but in fact , that note for the things that we &apos;re enter@@ ing that are not entirely limited to the big re@@ duc@@ ing , just the same , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for this break@@ through .
these break@@ through@@ s , we have to track with total gas , and we can measure that , in corpo@@ rate numbers , in pil@@ land and regu@@ lations change .
there are a lot of great books to this top@@ ic .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the ele@@ ction , &quot; and david m@@ ck@@ a@@ ys , &quot; the hot air , the hot air .
they really go through it and create a frame where this can be ambi@@ ted , because we need to support all the pages of all direc@@ tions .
there &apos;s a lot of things that need to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very consi@@ stent desire that we &apos;re inv@@ enting this technology .
if you were to give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a v@@ acc@@ ine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , hal@@ b@@ bled energy , without co2 , it &apos;s going to be acc@@ essi@@ ble . i &apos;m going to
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get that desire , the fall will be horri@@ ble between the long term and shor@@ t-@@ term conc@@ ern , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of the lives of that two billion will be a lot worse .
so , what do we need to do ?
what do any measure do i explain ?
we need to be used for more fore@@ set .
if countries are fac@@ ed in places like cop@@ es , they don &apos;t just want to talk about co2 .
they should disc@@ uss this innovation strategy , and they &apos;d be sho@@ cked by the ridi@@ cul@@ ous fun@@ ds that are going to be spent for these innova@@ tive approach@@ es .
we need market ri@@ pes , co2 ta@@ xes , ca@@ p &amp; amp ; trade &apos;s something that creates a price of price .
we &apos;ve got to spread the message .
we need to lead the dialo@@ gue more rational and complete , and the things that are being condu@@ cted by the government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can ful@@ fill it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand ter@@ ra@@ g@@ power a little bit more -- so can you give us an idea of scale of these invest@@ ing of these invest@@ ments ?
bill gates : in order to do the simulation on a super@@ computer , get all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need only a couple of 10 million , and even if we te@@ sted our materials in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure that it works reas@@ on@@ able , you &apos;re only in the 10@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ 0-@@ million .
the hard step is to build the first re@@ actor , to find other billions of billions , the statisti@@ cian and the place that actually buil@@ ds the first of them .
once the first thing is , when it &apos;s just done as promis@@ ing as promis@@ ers , it &apos;s very clear , because the economic importance , the energy is so different than nuclear energy , as we know it .
in order to understand this , this is almost how to build in the ground almost like a ver@@ tical wea@@ pon of nuclear fuel , this supp@@ ele@@ d@@ ated vac@@ cin@@ es , and then the process is going on , and it &apos;s continu@@ ing to continue down ?
b@@ g : exactly . now you have to re@@ store the re@@ actor , so there are a lot of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and get stuff into it . that &apos;s not good stuff . it
if you &apos;ve got very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a colum@@ n -- which you &apos;re bu@@ ried , without all of the comple@@ tion@@ ality .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it bur@@ ns about 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuclear re@@ actor that has provi@@ ded a solution for the waste .
b@@ g : yeah . now , what happens to the g@@ arb@@ age : you can get it there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then take it , and put it into the next re@@ actor and burn it into the next re@@ actor , and burn it .
and what we &apos;re starting to do is take the waste that &apos;s already there , which is already in these fri@@ cks or dry bu@@ ds in the re@@ ac@@ tors , and that &apos;s our star@@ cin@@ es . that &apos;s our star@@ cin@@ es .
so , what &apos;s a problem of these re@@ ac@@ tors was a problem , what we put in our fil@@ es , and it &apos;s going to reduce the waste of the waste dra@@ matically during that process .
but as you &apos;ve talked to different people in the world talking about these things .
where &apos;s the biggest interest of doing this really really ?
b@@ g : well , we haven &apos;t set up on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting pres@@ ent@@ ary rules for everything called the &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name , and there are big interest , and the people of the company were in russi@@ a , india , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve talked about the energy table and talked about how this is going to be the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have made a difference in the direction .
this is a vari@@ ation of a thing that &apos;s been made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster re@@ actor , and some countries have built this , so everyone who has conver@@ ted a fast re@@ actor , a can@@ di@@ date for our first first .
in your imagination , in terms of time and prob@@ ability , does this really really bring into life ?
b@@ g : well , we need one of these sc@@ al@@ able , electrical things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to inv@@ ent , and then we &apos;ve got 20 years to go to the year .
this is sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that has shown us the environmental models that we need to hold .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ g@@ power , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big desire , it might seem easy to think .
and lu@@ ck@@ ily , there are do@@ zens of companies , and we need hundreds of companies , the same as the ones that work , the way they work , will cause the pay@@ load for their pil@@ ots , can deliver it .
and it would be the best thing if it can do multiple , because then you could use a mix@@ ture .
anyway , we need a solution to a solution .
in terms of the big possible break@@ through@@ s , is this the biggest thing you know ?
b@@ g : one of the most important things is the most important thing .
that would be without the global requi@@ re@@ ment , but it would cause it as much as much as well .
in the nuclear sector , there &apos;s other innova@@ tions .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well , but there &apos;s the mod@@ ular method , and that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid re@@ actor guy , which seems a little hard , but maybe it seems to say that about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about it is that an ancient molecule has a million times as much energy as it has , say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and they &apos;re main@@ ly the radiation , the foot@@ print and the cost , the potential , the potential , is the impact , so the impact on the country , and other things , almost in a more li@@ dy .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we need to introdu@@ ce the emergen@@ cy skills to try to keep the so@@ ther@@ -@@ temper@@ ely ?
b@@ g : when you get to that situation , it &apos;s like you ate too much , and you &apos;re in front of a heart attack , and what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research direction called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which is associated with various techniques to del@@ ay global warming , so that we &apos;ve come up for 20 or 30 years to go together with us .
this is just an in@@ sur@@ ance techni@@ que .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on in@@ sur@@ ance because you might get rid of it , so you eat it , because you know that you &apos;re going to save heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a dis@@ course in ge@@ o@@ engineering , whether you should have allowed it , if things get faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
climate mas@@ ke@@ ri@@ sts : do you have one or two sent@@ ences for those who might to convince you ?
b@@ g : well unfortunately , unfortunately , the skep@@ tics live in a very different cam@@ ps .
the ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very little .
do you say that there &apos;s negative impli@@ cations to do with the clou@@ ds that are moving things moving ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at least , where there &apos;s a chance in a million .
the main problem here is a similar thing about aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot of time for it .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of commit@@ ted problems to invest into something that you just have later about , and the investment is not so clear . in fact , that the i@@ p@@ c@@ c is not necessarily the worst scen@@ ari@@ o , and there are people in the rich world looking at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , okay , that &apos;s not necessarily big dra@@ ma and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big dra@@ ma .
the fact is that these un@@ certain@@ ty should worry about us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time the skep@@ tics will say , &quot; okay , i &apos;m not going to say that it &apos;s not going to im@@ it@@ ate co2 , i wish , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t work me not to do it , but i &apos;m probably going to accept it
and that would be your answer to the b@@ j@@ ph@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument that , if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all of the other goals suff@@ er , the poverty redu@@ ction , the cost of malaria and so on , that it &apos;s a du@@ m@@ b waste of resource to invest money , while there &apos;s better things that we can do .
b@@ g : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend more than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dra@@ matic .
in addition , other things should not suff@@ er .
you get to big money , and there are very meaning@@ ful people con@@ tradi@@ ct , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund it , and i &apos;m going to try to fund it , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with me
it &apos;s because it &apos;s very short in front of a cost and fund@@ ing only the learning cur@@ ve , and i think we should try to try more things that have the potential to be much more che@@ aper .
if the sub@@ strate that you get is a very high energy activity , then only the rich will be able to get the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifest@@ yle .
it &apos;s a disaster for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s an disaster .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g thinks about it .
his new lim@@ b is now , &quot; why is the research not discus@@ sing anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still becoming , because of his former stories , with the skep@@ tics camp , but he agre@@ es that this is a very rural group , and so he &apos;s now making the research argument now .
and that &apos;s a con@@ temp@@ t that i think is appropriate for .
the research , it &apos;s just nu@@ ts , how little it will be suppor@@ ted .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all the people here , when i say , i really hope that your wish is going to be true . thank you very much
b@@ g : thank you very much .
a couple of years ago at ted , peter sc@@ ill@@ man created a design test called &quot; the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ mal challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds need to generate the largest potential structure with 20 sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i , about a meter of diam@@ e@@ he@@ tt@@ i , about a meter of diam@@ on@@ ds and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and build a diam@@ sh@@
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low needs to be up at the top .
and , even though it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s actually really difficult , because it &apos;s really hard to work together very rapi@@ dly .
and so i just thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design work@@ shop .
and it was a huge success .
since i &apos;ve been doing 70 work@@ sh@@ ops around the world , with students , develop@@ ers and architec@@ ts and architec@@ ts , even with c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 5@@ 0-@@ day companies , and there &apos;s something in this task that i want to share with you , and i &apos;d like to share some of those with you .
normally , most people are starting to ori@@ ent themselves for the task .
you &apos;re talking about , you &apos;re thinking about what it &apos;s going to look like , it &apos;s going to bur@@ den around power .
and then they invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . they sk@@ et@@ ch , and they sp@@ ell sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i .
they invest a lot of their time in your own , increasingly , growing up .
and finally , before you have no more time , someone takes the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they &apos;re going to clean it up to the top , come back to the top and go back and &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; and you &apos;re going to get your work .
but what &apos;s always , almost always happens , is that the ta@@ -@@ da is going to a &quot; u@@ h-@@ n , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ v causes the whole thing , the whole thing bur@@ st and bran@@ ches .
there are a bunch of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h-@@ n &quot; moments than others , and the worst ones are fresh b@@ w@@ f &apos;s clo@@ se@@ ments .
they lie , they s@@ hr@@ ink , they &apos;re conf@@ used , and they &apos;re really making in@@ tra@@ c@@ table .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; and under the best are fresh gu@@ ards of the kinder@@ garten garden .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
as peter said to us , they don &apos;t just produce the highest to@@ wers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : how does that come ? why about those ? what about those ?
and peter tells us , &quot; no one of the kids invest@@ ed at the ce@@ o of the sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i g@@ m@@ b@@ h . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in terms of power .
but there &apos;s one other reason .
and that &apos;s that b@@ w@@ ney &apos;s students have been trained to find a right plan , ok !
and then he reali@@ zes him .
what happens when you put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top of the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds to me , what ?
in other words , what kids do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low and build prototyp@@ es , successful prototyp@@ es , always with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low at the top , so that they have multiple times the ability to re@@ pair the opportunity to re@@ pair the ra@@ ir@@ ly prototyp@@ es .
con@@ struc@@ tors recognize these kinds of collaboration as a core of an i@@ ter@@ a@@ tive approach .
and with each attemp@@ t , kids get inst@@ antly feedback , and what doesn &apos;t .
and so the performance is to work with prototyp@@ es , so far -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are doing .
the average for most of them is about 500 in@@ ches , b@@ w@@ th students , half of them , who are raising half of them , but not much , child gar@@ dens children are better than adults .
who &apos;s at the most successful ?
architec@@ ts and engineers , for lu@@ ck .
diam@@ a is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand tri@@ d@@ gles and good self-@@ assem@@ ble ge@@ tri@@ cal patterns are the key to build resili@@ ent structures .
ce@@ os has a little bit about average . but here &apos;s going to be interesting .
if you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive admini@@ str@@ ator on the team , they &apos;re going to be signific@@ antly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and recognize , &quot; this is going to win . &quot;
you can predict the predic@@ tions . why is this happening ?
it &apos;s because they have special skills of process@@ ing .
they take the process , they understand it .
and this team , which gover@@ ns and on the work , is going to signific@@ antly improve the performance of the team , signific@@ antly improve .
speci@@ alized skills and process@@ or skills and their combin@@ ation and their combin@@ ation .
if you have 10 teams that are geogra@@ curr@@ ing , you get about 6 , you get stable structures .
now , i tried to do something interesting now .
and i thought we &apos;re going to take the po@@ cket &apos;s worth .
so i took a $ 10,000 prize on software for the w@@ inn@@ ers .
so , what do you believe with these design students ?
what was the out@@ come that ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a $ 700 in@@ ch high construction , he would have killed the prize home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high levels of competition have a strong effect ?
so we repe@@ ated this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think right now ?
now they understood the advantage of &quot; prototyp@@ ing . &quot;
and so , for the same , bad team became one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least of the time .
and there are deep lessons for us , about the nature of heal@@ ing and success .
and you might ask : why would anyone actually invest time to create a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ a &apos;s challenge ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , to help teams , video games , video games , and &quot; certain artists . &quot;
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenges does is , it helps to identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
because , frank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a shared language , a common language , to build the right prototyp@@ e .
and this is the value of this experience , this very simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in , can go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ho@@ wes@@ da@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
there &apos;s a ligh@@ t@@ -@@ ready ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy there .
they find crazy examples from all over the world , how people are optimi@@ zing and re@@ duc@@ ing the system .
there &apos;s also the world record as well .
and the basic lesson , i think , is actually a continu@@ ation of spor@@ ating spor@@ ts .
it dem@@ ands that we all make our senses to the task , and that we &apos;re using our thinking , how our emotions and our actions , in the challenge that &apos;s in front of us .
and sometimes a small prototyp@@ e of this experience is all that needs to get us from a &quot; u@@ h-@@ n &quot; -- to a ta@@ -@@ da , &quot; minute . &quot;
and that can make a difference a lot of difference .
thank you very much .
so , let &apos;s do that as if we had a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room needs to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and you can stay right now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i often asked my friends in the last time , and they would all go to the past , and they would all go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america , &quot; america &apos;s looking at the super@@ star . &quot;
&quot; i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re kind of stru@@ ck up to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , sort of fri@@ gh@@
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not a part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ er .
it &apos;s because we don &apos;t go back on the planet , they go forward .
so , i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the biggest time that we &apos;ve ever had on this planet , no matter which sc@@ ales you call : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , vulner@@ ability , dis@@ par@@ ance rates of disease .
there &apos;s never been a time like this before .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died all the time they were 60 years old .
and my grand@@ parents turned this number to 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the edge of the wo@@ unds .
so there should be better than a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born in new del@@ hi can expect for as long as the rich@@ est man in the world has been 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that true ?
small@@ po@@ x : small@@ po@@ x , the small@@ po@@ x has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve re@@ formed the demo@@ graphi@@ cs of the earth in a way that doesn &apos;t ever have any war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;ve disappe@@ ared .
we refer@@ red them . be@@ et@@ w .
in the weal@@ thy world , diseases that millions of us have rema@@ ined thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed only one generation , bar@@ ely even .
di@@ ph@@ ine , ro@@ cks , child &apos;s existence ...
does anyone even know what that is ?
vac@@ cin@@ es , moder@@ cin@@ es , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are success@@ ers of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to try things , see if it works , it &apos;s going to change it , one of the great achie@@ vement of humanity .
so , that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned , you know , they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achie@@ vement , one billion people around this world every day in the world will go to bed every day .
that number goes up , and it &apos;s going very fast , and that &apos;s hu@@ mili@@ ating .
and it &apos;s not just that we &apos;ve used our imagination to de@@ va@@ at this world to the world .
drin@@ king water , ancient land , rain@@ fore@@ sts , oil , gas , gas : they disappe@@ ar , and if we don &apos;t elimin@@ ate ourselves from that chaos , we disappe@@ ar .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think we can do it .
and i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think that we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t destro@@ y it at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a little bit of wonder .
but that &apos;s what kee@@ ve me at night -- one of the things i &apos;ve been in wake at night , and we &apos;ve never benef@@ ited scientific progress as now , or never .
and we were never able to be able to put it reas@@ on@@ ably , as we can .
we &apos;re at the th@@ res@@ hold of amazing events on a lot of places , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds of , 300 years before the re@@ vel@@ ation to find a time where we &apos;re consum@@ ing progress in progress , in which we &apos;ve been strug@@ gling about these things , in more fron@@ ts than we &apos;ve been .
people are s@@ mil@@ ing in their faith , and it &apos;s so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t free them .
it &apos;s not even the truth going to free it .
and listen , everyone &apos;s got a right at its opini@@ on , even a right to its point of progress .
but do you know what you &apos;re not right of ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . sorry , they don &apos;t have .
and i &apos;ve taken a while to find that out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vac@@ cin@@ ation for &quot; the new yor@@ ker , &quot; a little article .
and i was ama@@ zed to get on resi@@ stance about what was at the end of the most effective practice in health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did whatever i was doing , i wrote an article , and i kept going .
and soon , i wrote an article about mathema@@ tically engine@@ ered fo@@ ods .
the same thing , it &apos;s just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this would be &quot; fran@@ ken@@ -@@ food , &quot; why they believed that molecules could melt around a certain rather than a random way to the area of the nature .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , and i kept doing the article
i mean , &quot; i &apos;m a journalist .
we &apos;re typ@@ ing , we &apos;re going to eat , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay
but i was worried about these artic@@ les , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and finally , i discovered it .
and that &apos;s because these fan@@ t@@ makers that made me crazy at all was not a fan@@ cy at all .
these were highly people , educ@@ ated people , in@@ tra@@ c@@ table people .
and they were just like the people in this room .
and that sort of got me through another one .
but then i was thinking , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we arri@@ ve at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress as we did before .
we &apos;re all talking about it .
we &apos;re talking ir@@ on@@ ically , with little approach@@ es , says , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons that are there , and i think we know what causes these reasons are .
we have the confidence in institutions , in auth@@ ority , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call a couple of names , and people will understand .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ wee@@ al , the real , vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of destruction , the u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction , the u.s. pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction .
i mean , you know , you can sele@@ ct your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we thought were always right . thank you very skep@@ tical .
ask , ask evidence , ask evidence , ask it .
don &apos;t take any more than gran@@ ted .
but here it is : if you get to the evidence , you have to adop@@ t this evidence , and you &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell that from the reason that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen them , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story , which brought autis@@ m epidemic with cle@@ an@@ ers , mu@@ mp@@ s , and ro@@ ff@@ ine vac@@ cin@@ es .
very fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
often studies have been done to see if that was true .
number studies should be done , that &apos;s a serious thing .
and the data came in .
the data came in from the u.s. , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and they were all the same , no cor@@ relation , no com@@ modi@@ ties , none of them .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see what we see , that we feel really real .
we don &apos;t believe in a b@@ und@@ le of docum@@ ents of a government who has data , and i understand that , i think we all do it .
but , you know what ?
and the result of this was cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c .
cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c because of this fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world in which the vac@@ cin@@ ators are fall@@ ing for mas@@ ri@@ les .
this is sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous , and we should be as@@ ham@@ ed .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
so what &apos;s happening is that we could do that .
now , i understand that . i do .
because does anyone have cle@@ an@@ ers here ?
has one in the audience who see someone die from mas@@ ners ?
doesn &apos;t happen very often .
in this country , it &apos;s not happening at all , but it &apos;s about 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of dea@@ ths from mas@@ ners , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not happening here , we can push it , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can walk around and walk around mes@@ sages from fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like op@@ ra@@ h and lar@@ ry king live live .
and you can do that because they don &apos;t rel@@ ate to cause caus@@ ing causes and cor@@ relation .
they don &apos;t understand these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing is .
and this is something that we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quick .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he commit@@ ted us from one of the worst mo@@ vers of human human beings .
no fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ y , no di@@ vor@@ s , child &apos;s existence , bu@@ ff , disappe@@ ared .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do so much .
it &apos;s called paul off@@ it .
he has just developed a ro@@ ta@@ vi@@ al v@@ acc@@ ine with a few other people .
he can save the lives of 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ , 50@@ 0,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , that &apos;s good , except that paul goes around and talks about vac@@ cin@@ es and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop jam@@ an@@ tee .
and that &apos;s what he actually says like this .
so , paul is a terror@@ ist .
when paul talks about a public audience , he can &apos;t tell any ar@@ med bu@@ ll@@ er without any r@@ un@@ k .
he gets calls at home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vac@@ cin@@ es are in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate .
take them on , go back to the diseases , awful disease , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
we now have mas@@ ners in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to make worse , and pretty soon children will die again , because that &apos;s just a matter of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die about mas@@ ders .
what about child paraly@@ sis ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a com@@ ent@@ ary of mine made me written a few weeks ago , and i said i was a little bit of scrat@@ ch .
no one ever said this before .
she wouldn &apos;t vac@@ cin@@ ate her child against kin@@ dness . not a case .
soli@@ d .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a ph@@ lot of kin@@ dness , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have auto paraly@@ sis in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s somebody sitting in la@@ gos , in la@@ gos , and he &apos;s going to go to los angeles , at the moment , he &apos;s on o@@ hi@@ o .
and in a couple of hours he lands , and he ten@@ ds a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these amazing ted days ton@@ ight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infe@@ cted with a soli@@ ity , and we don &apos;t know , because this is the way the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not .
we love to sh@@ in ourselves in lying . we love that .
have you recor@@ ded all your vi@@ tam@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ y@@ ac@@ e@@ a : a little anti@@ o@@ xi@@ t@@ um , a little anti@@ anth@@ rop@@ y that makes you on the edge .
i know you &apos;ve done this because half americans do this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
the data compar@@ es all the time .
they sha@@ ke their ur@@ in . they almost don &apos;t do anymore .
that &apos;s okay , you &apos;d like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ in numbers .
i &apos;m totally agre@@ ed to them .
dark ur@@ in . dark .
so why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think that i understand -- we hate the business industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have any confidence in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is dung .
and it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely ama@@ z@@ ingly cold and se@@ arch@@ ing itself to us that can afford .
so we &apos;re running away , and where are we going to do ?
we &apos;re walking into the arms of the plac@@ e@@ bo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love the plac@@ e@@ bo industri@@ es .
but , you know , that &apos;s a really serious thing , because the stuff is cra@@ m@@ b , and we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve got all kinds of little pro@@ ps here .
none of it -- g@@ ing@@ ko , it &apos;s called e@@ ma@@ ac@@ e@@ a , who is , ac@@ ai , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re giving billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s na@@ ked .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scre@@ am me up and say , &quot; well , what do you worry about ? don &apos;t people do what they want .
that &apos;s the way you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
it &apos;s because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the health minister , who says , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to accept my law to mammo@@ graph@@ y , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ bre@@ bu@@ ber , who want to treat his patients with a brand proce@@ d@@ ure .
if you go to that path , where belief and magic and magic replace science , they get to a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they &apos;re going to th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki in south africa .
he brought 40@@ 0,000 of his people , because he agre@@ ed that red birds , po@@ ckets and le@@ mon oil are much more effective than anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs , that we know that they can bra@@ ke the out@@ come of aids .
hundreds of thousands of un@@ reli@@ able dea@@ ths in a country , which is worse than any other one of this disease .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they &apos;ve got them . they &apos;ve always got them .
now , the brain lo@@ west epidemic that we are right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d struggle between the wor@@ ries of gene@@ tically modi@@ cally modi@@ cally modi@@ cally modi@@ fied fo@@ ods and bio@@ -@@ eli@@ te .
this is an i@@ dio@@ tic debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
this is ide@@ ology , not science .
everything that we eat , every ri@@ ce , every bran@@ ch , every two-@@ dimensional pe@@ al , each ro@@ il@@ or@@ as , was changed by the people .
you know , there was no mand@@ ar@@ ine in par@@ ad@@ ise .
there were no can@@ tali@@ can@@ e mel@@ n@@ ons .
there were no christ@@ mas trees . we did all of this .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 1@@ 1@@ -@@ 1@@ 1@@ ly .
and some of these has worked and some of it didn &apos;t work .
we got rid of that , which didn &apos;t work .
now , we can do it more , and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vi@@ tam@@ in a in ri@@ ce , and the stuff can help millions of people , to get their lives exten@@ ding their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we re@@ gar@@ d@@ ably re@@ gar@@ d@@ ingly re@@ duc@@ ed food .
so why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m going to hear about is too many chemicals , pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want to patent companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies see@@ ds see@@ ds .
and you know what my answer is to all of this ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s re@@ ference that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
and that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , mor@@ ality , pat@@ ent@@ ine .
you know that science doesn &apos;t have a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it works , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed , and it kee@@ ps millions of people from in@@ fl@@ ir@@ es .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent . 70 percent .
and this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed . sh@@ ame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it it .
and why ? mathema@@ tically , it really shif@@ ts food .
we don &apos;t want to encoura@@ ge people to eat this bu@@ red stuff , for example , &quot; for example . &quot;
mani@@ ok is something which is a half a billion people eating .
it &apos;s a little bit like a po@@ ta@@ to .
it &apos;s just a b@@ und@@ le cal@@ ories . it &apos;s the dung thing .
it has no nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are doing all this in it .
and then people could not be the food and wouldn &apos;t get blin@@ d-@@ blind .
you wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve up , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ sis , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to that is , why are we going to fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why are we going to fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to s@@ wal@@ ink genes ?
it &apos;s not about sho@@ ot@@ ing genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our in@@ genu@@ ity on lar@@ gely food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about ri@@ ce kr@@ is@@ pi@@ es , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the most time time to understand what that means .
because , you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do so far as we do , we do something about something that we don &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty , high-@@ tech col@@ oni@@ alism .
there &apos;s no other descri@@ ption for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s not wor@@ thy of ours , and we really need to keep it .
and after this incredibly funny entertain@@ ment , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go in this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway , anyway . i want to do that anyway .
right now , in the present , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can make this time machine on everything that we want .
we can move them , where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we have to lead these conver@@ sa@@ tions , and we have to think , but if we get into the time machine and we &apos;re going to go into the future , we &apos;re going to be very happy to have it done .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned about it , this is something that the world needs now .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ve been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect for some time , and it may seem strange that a ma@@ gi@@ cian is interested in it , unless you look at it as , as &quot; an illusion , which is going to be appropriate if someone thinks it &apos;s going to be hard enough to do it . &quot;
in other studies , there are a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in some studies in some studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which is , in fact , because the person thinks what happens to her is a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical or a kind of -- in the pain management management , for example , if the patient is doing what &apos;s happening to her , a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body , a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body , that is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body that you call the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
it becomes a de@@ ception to something , because someone percei@@ ves it so that way .
so in order to understand each other , i &apos;d like to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that is at least since the 195@@ 0s in every ma@@ ma@@ on book for children .
i myself learned him from the cu@@ b sc@@ under@@ s of the p@@ lot fin@@ der in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;m descri@@ bing him .
so , let &apos;s see what happens .
the kni@@ fe you can analy@@ ze ; my hand you can analy@@ ze .
i &apos;m going to just hold the kni@@ ves like this in my own .
i &apos;ll go back my sle@@ e@@ p .
and in order to make sure nothing in my sle@@ it@@ age , or come out of it , i &apos;m just going to push my wr@@ ist up here .
and in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time moving anything , so as long as i &apos;ve got conver@@ sa@@ tions , nothing can go out of my sle@@ e@@ p or come out .
and the goal with this is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the kni@@ fe will be ac@@ compli@@ shed through my na@@ ked physical magne@@ tis@@ m .
in fact , it &apos;s so ti@@ red of his place that i can sha@@ ke it without thro@@ wing the kni@@ ves down .
nothing wal@@ ks into my sle@@ it@@ ute or comes out , no stam@@ ckets . and they can study everything .
ta@@ -@@ da !
now , this is a trick that i often spend small kids who are interested in magic because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception , because you can learn a lot about de@@ ception , even though it &apos;s a very simple kind of a trick trick .
probably a lot of you know here in the room that &apos;s the trick .
he works the way that it works .
i &apos;m holding the kni@@ fe in my hand .
i say that i close my wr@@ ist to make sure that there &apos;s nothing going away in my sle@@ ttle , or comes out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i make my wr@@ ist is that the actual myster@@ y is the actual secret of illusion .
so the moment that i fli@@ ps my hand from you , so you can see them from the back , and the fing@@ ers here , my memory finger , just from where he was , in a position where it was so stre@@ t@@ ched .
fab@@ ul@@ ous : great trick ?
there &apos;s someone in the back sitting there who had no childhood .
so , here he is here . right .
and as i turn around , i change the fing@@ ers that way .
and now , you can talk about why this is a de@@ ception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fing@@ ers down there : because the mind and the way it &apos;s process@@ ing information , doesn &apos;t count them , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s really not about , and then i open my hand , right ?
of course , it &apos;s held there , but it &apos;s not through magne@@ tis@@ m of my body , but through a trick , through my pres@@ ence , is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing is , by turning me back , it &apos;s going to hi@@ de through this movement that the fing@@ ers will move back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the kni@@ fe .
that &apos;s a trick you can take your friends and neighb@@ ors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
a year ago or so , i read a study that really came out of me really really .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , and that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been an amazing thing to do .
and it turns out that if you offer a plac@@ e@@ ther in the form of a white p@@ ill , in the form of an as@@ pir@@ in@@ p@@ ill@@ ar , that &apos;s just a round , white p@@ ill , which has a certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect that has a certain
but if you give the shape in which you give the copy of the plac@@ e@@ ther , for example , in a smaller p@@ ill , and you can make these blue holes and make a letter on it , it &apos;s actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effective .
and that , even though it &apos;s any pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical of any -- they &apos;re just nu@@ ro@@ wing p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill isn &apos;t just as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? it made me really s@@ hr@@ ink me .
but it turns out that &apos;s not all of us yet .
if you take cap@@ ri@@ les , it &apos;s even more effective than p@@ ills of any shape .
a color@@ ful cap@@ su@@ le , which is at a very bottom yellow and on the other red , is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
it &apos;s also a role of do@@ zation .
a pil@@ ro@@ ws twice two days is not as good as three p@@ ills -- i can &apos;t remember the ex@@ act statistics of statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s the cru@@ cial thing , but it &apos;s
... that &apos;s also the do@@ si@@ tu@@ s@@ ies of the do@@ si@@ als too .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ulti@@ mate plac@@ e@@ bo effect , you &apos;ve got to go to the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ inge with an effective -- a few milli@@ li@@ ters of an effective sub@@ stance that you inje@@ ct to a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s a lot stron@@ ger than a white p@@ ill .
this ch@@ art is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a proje@@ ctor .
so , the fact is that the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill that doesn &apos;t do as good as a cap@@ su@@ le that doesn &apos;t really appear as well as the need@@ le .
and none of it has some really pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical property , and it &apos;s just our belief that makes us a stron@@ ger effect .
and i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that obviously is a de@@ ception , and let it look really real .
we know from this study , that you have to get to the need@@ le if it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is an ei@@ gh@@ th in@@ ch of hu@@ t@@ na@@ l . it &apos;s very , very cra@@ pp@@ y , and i &apos;m going to first take you a little bit of a very ster@@ ili@@ zing .
this is really my fl@@ fl@@ y . it &apos;s not ste@@ i@@ an &apos;s speci@@ le fl@@ at@@ ens .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
so i &apos;m going to clim@@ b these need@@ le into my skin and turn through it , and i &apos;m going to turn it through the other side , right now .
if you get weal@@ thi@@ er -- if you fall really in trouble -- i took this a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman who i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s become almost more power@@ ed with a woman .
so i &apos;m suggest@@ ing that if you get very little , you look at the next 30 seconds , you &apos;re going to look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first heal@@ ing part here .
you can see it , you can see it , but you can see it as well , if you want
so , right here , right here , where my fl@@ um start , the lower part of my arm i &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a little bit .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make it nu@@ ts ?
and just a little bit through my skin just a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we &apos;ve had with the mes@@ ner@@ sy .
sort of .
but now you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers , don &apos;t you ?
so , am i going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , you know .
and i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s certainly not so stupid , and it &apos;s going to be the skin , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
so what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know it .
and people at the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen it right . &quot;
now , the people in the side of rooms come into the side .
let me show you close to you .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my fl@@ un@@ k , and i can turn this around .
sorry . if you get weal@@ thi@@ ous , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
now , people behind the back or the one who would some@@ day go on the video some@@ day , say , &quot; well yeah , it looks very impres@@ sive , but if it was real , he would -- you know , here &apos;s a hole , and there &apos;s a big hole , and if it was really real , it would ble@@ aten flo@@ wers . &quot;
okay , let me ski@@ p out a little blood for you .
yes , here it is .
so normally i would take the need@@ le out now .
i would clean my arm cle@@ aner , and i &apos;ll show you that there are no wo@@ unded .
but i think in this context here , and with the purpose of being a de@@ ception , something real , i &apos;m going to let the need@@ le go in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll be pleas@@ ed on that . thank you very much .
everyone &apos;s talking about happiness now .
i &apos;ve gather@@ ed the number of books that have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the ti@@ tle in the last five years , and they &apos;ve picked up for about 40 , and there &apos;s been a lot more .
there &apos;s a huge wave of interest to be lucky among explor@@ ers .
there &apos;s a lot of lucky co@@ ach@@ ing .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but despite all of these ra@@ ins of work , there are several cognitive ones that somehow make it impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today will be main@@ ly going to act by these cognitive levels .
that &apos;s what la@@ ve that thinks about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just as op@@ posed to as anyone else .
the first one of these ro@@ cks is an in@@ qu@@ ir@@ y of complexity to ad@@ mit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word , because we &apos;re appl@@ ying it into too many different things .
and i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we might be limited on , but the whole thing that we have to give up is something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to adop@@ t the complicated view of what &apos;s being well-@@ being .
the second tra@@ p is a repres@@ ent@@ ative of experience and memory : it &apos;s basically between being happy in your life and happiness about your life , or happy with your life .
and these are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both immer@@ sed in the notion of happiness .
and the third is concent@@ ration of concent@@ ration , and that &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about a circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being , without the sense of being di@@ stor@@ ting .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive tra@@ cations .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right right now .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a question answer , because of one of my lec@@ tures , one story repor@@ ted . &#91; un@@ clear -- &#93; he said he had heard a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely poe@@ tic music , and at the end of the recor@@ ding , there was a terrible cir@@ cular sound , and at the end of the recor@@ ding , there was a terrible thing .
and then he ad@@ ded up , really pretty emotion@@ ally emotion@@ ally , and it &apos;s ru@@ ined the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t have .
what it had to ru@@ in it was the memor@@ ies of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of power@@ -@@ mo@@ sting music .
they weren &apos;t coun@@ ting , because he was liber@@ ated with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ in , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what this really tells us is that we might be thinking about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
there is a living self that lives in the present , and the present knows the present is capable of experi@@ en@@ cing the past , but it &apos;s basically the pres@@ ence of the present .
it &apos;s the real self that the physi@@ cian is about -- you know , when the doctor as@@ ks , &quot; is it hurt when i &apos;m attac@@ king you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory self is that that coun@@ ts and the history of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the physi@@ cian is talking by asking the question , &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
or &quot; how did your journey go to al@@ b@@ ani@@ a ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different un@@ its , the living self , and the memor@@ i@@ ent self , and that &apos;s part of that , is part of the appe@@ ar@@ ance of happiness in the way .
now , the memory self is a story@@ t@@ eller .
and this really starts with a profound response to our memor@@ ies -- it &apos;s beginning to start .
we &apos;re not just talking about stories , when we &apos;re going to do it on telling stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is , what we need to keep away from our experiences is a story .
and let &apos;s take you with an example of this .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients teaching themselves a pain@@ ful proce@@ d@@ ure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not fun today , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was done in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their recor@@ ds .
and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who &apos;s got more suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly had more suff@@ ered . his inte@@ m refle@@ ction was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how did these patients think that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise here .
and the surprise is that patient a has a much worse memory on the appe@@ ar@@ um refle@@ ction than a patient &apos;s .
the stories of the gut refle@@ ction was different , and because of a very significant part of the story , how it ends .
and none of these stories is very sophisti@@ cated or magni@@ fi@@ cent -- but one of them is this magni@@ fi@@ cent thing .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other one .
and the one that &apos;s worse was the one where the pain was at the very end at the end . it &apos;s a bad story .
so how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their gut refle@@ ction , and a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing rema@@ ining ? &quot;
and she was a lot worse for a than b in memory .
now , this is a direct conflict between the circum@@ stances itself and remem@@ ber@@ ing itself .
from the circum@@ stances of the circum@@ stances , there was clearly a little worse time .
now , what you could do with the patient , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s made clinical experiments , and it &apos;s made , and it works , and it works , you could actually be exten@@ ding the tube &apos;s refle@@ ction without just very much at it , and you can just sha@@ ke the
it &apos;s going to lead to the patient , but only a little bit and much less than before .
and if you make that for a couple of minutes , you have achie@@ ved that the living self is worse to the patient &apos;s life , and you &apos;ve got to realize that the memory of your patient is much better off , because now you &apos;ve given patient a a better story about its experience .
so what &apos;s a story of a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that cause us , and it &apos;s true for the stories that we inv@@ ent .
which is characteri@@ zed by a story of tran@@ scen@@ dence , lar@@ ge-@@ scale moments and ends .
end , very , very important , and in this case domin@@ ated the end of it .
now , the living self has continu@@ ously continu@@ es to be continu@@ ous
it has moments of life , one after another .
and you ask , what &apos;s going on with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve done that -- you know , you know , the psych@@ ological present consi@@ sts than about three seconds , which means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them , which means , you know , there are about 600 million of them . and most of you don &apos;t leave a lot of time .
most of you are completely ignor@@ ed by remem@@ ber@@ es of remem@@ ber@@ es .
and yet , you get the impres@@ sion that you should count that what happens during this st@@ lot of life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we consu@@ me while we are in the world .
and as we would be consum@@ ing it would seem to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that kee@@ ps the memory itself for us .
so we have the memory itself , and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the struggle of time .
from the circum@@ stances of the circum@@ stances , if you have a vac@@ ation and the second week as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ hour vac@@ ation clock .
and that &apos;s not how the memory itself does not work at all .
for memory itself , a two-@@ hour vac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one-@@ hour vac@@ ation , because there &apos;s no new memor@@ ies to be provi@@ ded in new memor@@ ies .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is the critical vari@@ able that separ@@ ates a remin@@ der self from a living self , time has very little influence on this story .
now , the memory self is more than remem@@ ber@@ ing and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient , who , say , have two impres@@ sions in two different surge@@ ons and deci@@ des what he should vote to , then is the one who choo@@ ses the memory , which is less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that will be sel@@ ec@@ ted .
the living self doesn &apos;t have a voice in that ele@@ ction .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience , and we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experience .
we &apos;re thinking about our future as a predic@@ ted memor@@ ies .
and in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ne@@ i of the memory itself , and you can think of the memor@@ ist self as one , which is sort of the experience of experience by experiences that don &apos;t need the living self .
i have the impres@@ sion that if we do vac@@ ation , which is very often , which is , we &apos;re going to do resili@@ ently in the service of memor@@ i@@ cians &apos; services .
and it &apos;s a little bit harder to justi@@ fy , i think .
i mean , how much do we to@@ ss from our memor@@ ies ?
this is one of the explan@@ ations that &apos;s been given for the domin@@ ance self of memory itself .
and when i think about it , i think of a vac@@ ation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , which is clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think there &apos;s a lot more often in relation to how often i think i think of other vac@@ ance .
and i probably have my memor@@ ies of this three-@@ wee@@ k@@ ly journey , i would say maybe 25 minutes for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever opened up the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures there , i would have spent another hour of a month .
now , that &apos;s three weeks , and those are just a half and a half hours .
and there seems to be an in@@ sur@@ su@@ ment .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , in a sense , how little appe@@ ar@@ ish@@ ing me on the to@@ cks of memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why are we giving memor@@ ies so much weight relative to the weight that we &apos;re going to experience ?
so , i want you to think about an exper@@ t experiment .
imagine your next vac@@ ation , you know , at the end of the vac@@ ation , all your pictures will be mis@@ sed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ eric drug , so that you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you choose another vac@@ ation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two kind of self , and you have to think about how you decide how to decide this conflict , and it &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think of time , you might get an answer , and if you think of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
why we choose the vac@@ ance that we choose is a problem that hol@@ ds us with a choice between the two kinds of self .
now , the two types of self are to@@ sting up two terms of happiness .
in fact , there are two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can use , one one of them .
so , you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the eyes in the life of the circum@@ stances of the life itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments of eye is a pretty complicated process .
so what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
and , by the way , we are able to get a pretty good explan@@ ation from the happiness of the life itself .
when you ask the happiness of memory , it &apos;s a very different thing to do .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or pleas@@ ant is the person when this person thinks about their life .
a lot of different term .
anyone who &apos;s unlike these terms is going to exac@@ ck@@ hr@@ ase the happiness of happiness , and i &apos;m involved to a lot of researchers about well-@@ being , who have just cra@@ gh@@ ted the research of the fortun@@ ate long way in the same way .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the law itself and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of memory itself has been recogni@@ zed in the last few years , and now you &apos;re hop@@ ing to measure the two separate spaces .
the gall@@ up organization has a global survey in which over half a million people have asked questions about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts in the direction of the direction .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
and the main lesson that we think is learned , i think , is that they are really different .
you can know how pleasure someone is with his life , and that &apos;s really not teaching them a lot about how happy he lives and vice ver@@ sa .
just to give you an idea of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is that if you hit someone , and you &apos;d tell you , oh , his father is a two-@@ meter man , how much would you know about your size ?
now , you &apos;d know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
they have such a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
if i tell you that someone has been in a scale of 10 in a scale of 10 , they have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy he is with his living self .
so , the cor@@ relation is small .
we know something about what makes happiness happiness satis@@ fac@@ tion .
and we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly to be satis@@ fied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure of pleasure , but that &apos;s domin@@ ant .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the course of the two ways of ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing , you will be doing very different things at the end .
so the conclu@@ sion of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness as being a re@@ plac@@ ement for well-@@ being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very brie@@ fly , another reason that we can &apos;t really think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things if we think about life , and if we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the cor@@ rect answer .
and if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happ@@ ier if they , say , in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the min@@ d@@ set of self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
now , because the care@@ ful self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could go to california at the end of california
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pur@@ sue what happens to people who are moving to california in hope , to be happ@@ ier .
now , your life is not going to become happ@@ ier .
and we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happ@@ ier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to be remin@@ ded about how awful the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o , and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;ve made the right choice .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about comfort , and i hope i &apos;ve given you an idea of how difficult it is .
thank you very much .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you very much .
now , when we finished a couple of weeks of books , they told me that there was a fairly interesting result that came out of this gall@@ up survey .
is this something that you can participa@@ te with , because now you have a few minutes left ?
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure , sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gall@@ on survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
and we found this in terms of the happiness of the movement itself .
when we look at how emotions interact with the income vari@@ es .
and it turns out that under a 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large explosion of americans , about 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 , but it &apos;s a big repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple , under a 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 income explosion of a year of 6@@ 0@@ 0,000 dollars a year .
se@@ ven@@ y-@@ four .
d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 , 6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they &apos;re going to become more un@@ fortun@@ ate , the more poor@@ er they &apos;re going to get
and we get a perfectly flat line on that .
i mean , i &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen flat lines so far .
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t stand to you any random fortun@@ e , but that lack of money , lack of money , and we can measure this mis@@ er@@ able very , very clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , the memory itself , you get another story .
the more money you deser@@ ve happ@@ ier is you .
that &apos;s not the case of emotions .
but dan@@ ny , in the american american education , is about life , freedom , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people are going to take these jud@@ g@@ ments seriously , i mean , it seems to put it all on the head , everything that we believe , for example , in terms of tax@@ oning policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , generally , that the country generally would take orders and make it based on it based on it based on it ?
d@@ k : well , you know , i think there are recogni@@ tion for the role of happiness in politics .
the recogni@@ tion will be slow in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries it &apos;s going to happen .
people are starting to recognize that they should be thinking about happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will disc@@ uss whether or not they want to study experience , or whether they &apos;re trying to explore life rat@@ ings , so we &apos;ve got to take this discussion a little bit more quickly .
how do you increase happiness is very different depen@@ dent on how you think and whether you think about the memor@@ ist yourself , or whether you think about the rest of your own self .
that &apos;s going to influence politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you have to measure the experience of the population &apos;s happiness .
that will be , i think , in the next year or two of the national statistics , i think , in the next decade or two .
well , it seems to me that this top@@ ic will be , or at least the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavi@@ oral economics .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m jan@@ e mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m designing computer games .
i &apos;ve been designing online games for about 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy to save the world in reality , as it is to save in online games .
i have a plan for that . i &apos;d like to convince more people , including all of them to spend more time with playing bigger and great games .
currently , we spend three billion hours a week with online games .
some of you may think , &quot; well , that &apos;s a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a little too much time , if you think about how many problems we need to solve in the real world .
but in fact , in the proje@@ ction , in my research , in the institute , i think , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most comp@@ elling problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to be dra@@ matically going to increase this time dra@@ matically .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated that it took time at 21 billion hours a week .
now , it seems to be something that may seem to be a little bit anno@@ ying , so i &apos;m going to do it so that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , climate confli@@ cts and o@@ bes@@ ity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 20 hours a week or at the end of the next decade .
no , i mean , really , really seriously .
why ? this picture descri@@ bes quite exactly why i think that games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously is serious .
this is a portra@@ it of phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he &apos;d set up a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classi@@ cal expres@@ sions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe some of the nu@@ an@@ ces in this picture are in this picture .
you probably see this sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fear , but also the first concent@@ ration of concent@@ ra@@ tions , very deep into solving a really difficult problem .
if you also play , you &apos;ll see some nu@@ an@@ ces here , standing up and the mouth are a sign of optimis@@ m , and the mouth are a sign of optimis@@ m . the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws show surprise .
this is a player on the edge of a so-@@ called epi@@ thetic ac@@ r@@ ar .
oh , you know that . ok . great . so we have a couple of players here .
an ep@@ c vic@@ tory is a result which is so super@@ -@@ positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination of imagination .
and when they do it , they &apos;re sho@@ cked that they &apos;re actually capable of being able to do something like this . that &apos;s an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
this guy is at a moment in front of an epi@@ c vic@@ tory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of proble@@ m-@@ re@@ pa@@ irs all over the world , when we take the barri@@ ers of the next century , and the face of people who are facing the edge of all the species at the edge of an ep@@ c of an ep@@ c .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re seeing more of this face in real life , when we &apos;re going to address hard problems .
i call it as the &quot; in life &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok . ok . &quot;
that &apos;s me , as i am , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad , &quot; face . &quot;
this is a gra@@ ff@@ iti of my former home in ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , california , where i &apos;m explor@@ ing in my ph@@ .@@ d. , why we are better in playing games than in real life .
this is a problem that has a lot of players .
we think that we &apos;re not as good as playing in games .
and i &apos;m not just talking about less success@@ fully , even though that bel@@ on@@ gs to it .
we &apos;re reach@@ ing more worl@@ ds . i mean , i &apos;m talking about motivation to do something meaning@@ ful , inspired to collabor@@ ate with collaboration .
if we are in a game world , i think a lot of us turn into our best version , and we &apos;re willing to be willing to solve the problem for any@@ time , trying to solve the problem for the time , as long as we need to try and try to do it again .
and in reality , when we fail failure , when we get to ob@@ stac@@ les , we often feel differently .
we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med . we feel ourselves . we feel thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , maybe depres@@ sed , fru@@ strated or zy@@ ni@@ c .
we never have these feelings , when we play games , we just don &apos;t have a game .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to look at as a ph@@ .@@ d. .
why is it impossible in play to think , you couldn &apos;t just reach everything ?
how can we trans@@ late these feelings from play into the reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of war@@ craft , which provi@@ des the ide@@ al environment to collabor@@ ative proble@@ m-@@ solving .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that are the epi@@ c vic@@ tory in online worl@@ ds that make possible possible .
well , first of all , if you go up in one of these online games , particularly in the world of war@@ craft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters willing to trust them to trust a global repres@@ ent@@ ative mission , and that &apos;s what happens right now .
but not just any mission , but it &apos;s a mission that fit perfectly to its current levels in the game , right ?
so this is what they do .
you never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their cap@@ abilities , so they have to be enga@@ ged , but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in the world of war@@ craft .
you don &apos;t sit around and roll@@ ing around , and there &apos;s always a little bit important to do .
and there are a couple of these volunte@@ ers .
and wher@@ ever you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to conclu@@ de their epi@@ c mission .
we don &apos;t have that simple life in real life , that feeling that , in a finger@@ bag of a finger@@ ho@@ und staf@@ f , they &apos;re ready to stand up .
and also , there &apos;s this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we are , and what we have to do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard from &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + half , &quot; or &quot; + one , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
that const@@ ant feedback is not going to be in real life .
if i leave this series , i didn &apos;t have one : + one talk + 1 and + half one crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i &apos;m not going to get this feedback in real life .
now , the problem of co@@ oper@@ ative online worl@@ ds like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to stand at the edge of an ep@@ c of an ep@@ c , that we rather spend our entire time in these game worl@@ ds .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
so far , all the world &apos;s world of war@@ cra@@ tor players have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years working to solve the virtual problems of a@@ gr@@ ar .
it &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it may sound an@@ xi@@ ous .
but in order to see it in context , 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago , our first pri@@ mate ancestors started to go forward .
so the first exciting pri@@ mate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend play with play , it just makes sense when you think about the time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extra@@ ordin@@ arily conven@@ tional .
but also , because it turns out that , by appl@@ ying all these time , we &apos;re actually going to change the way we &apos;re capable of being able to change what we &apos;re capable of as people .
we &apos;re developing to commun@@ ori@@ zing , heart creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . that &apos;s what i believe .
and if you look at this interesting stati@@ stic that was recently published by a resear@@ cher of car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university , the average young man of today in a country with a strong play@@ culture , has spent 10,000 hours with the 21@@ st year .
so , 10,000 hours is an interesting number , two reasons , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the u.s. , 10@@ 0@@ 0,000 hours are the accu@@ rate amount of money that they spend in school , from the fif@@ th grade to high school , if you never miss .
so we have a complete par@@ alle@@ l path here , where young people learn the same thing about what it means to be a good player , like anything else that they learn in school .
and maybe some of you may have read the new book of mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well , &quot; over@@ fli@@ ck@@ ers . &quot;
so , you know , the theory of success , the theory of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the magni@@ fi@@ cent study of cogni@@ tiv@@ ary science that when we spend 10,000 hours with the mou@@ ths of a random subject to the age of the 21@@ d-@@ life , we &apos;re going to be to master in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing whatever the most won@@ gh@@ ous people in the world .
so , what we &apos;ve got here is a complete generation of young people who are ma@@ ster@@ -@@ player .
so the big question is , &quot; what &apos;s the ex@@ act number of guys that are ma@@ ster@@ y good ? &quot;
because if we could find this out , we would have never had any human potential for us before that .
so many people in the world who spend at least one hour per hour per day playing with online games .
these are our ma@@ ster@@ -@@ fac@@ tors . 500 million people who are remark@@ ably good at &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we &apos;ve got another billion players who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever .
and if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry develop@@ s that are going to save energy and work on mobile devices instead of the broad@@ band internet , so that players all over the world , especially in india , china can play online .
you expect a more extra billion player in the next decade .
and we have a total 1.@@ 5 billion players with that .
so , i started to think about what it is to be doing in the games of this game .
here are the four things that i found . first of all , consi@@ sten@@ cy optimis@@ m .
ok , imagine this as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation .
and consi@@ sten@@ cy optimis@@ m is the desire to do something , to master a bar@@ rier , together with the belief that we have a commit@@ ted hope on success .
players always believe that an ep@@ c is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and try and do it , and that &apos;s the same thing .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are ma@@ sters of social nets in spi@@ der .
there are a lot of interesting studies that show that we like people more than when we play with them , even if they &apos;ve mis@@ sed us , even if they &apos;re har@@ m@@ ful .
the reason for that is that there &apos;s a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we trust that someone has time to give us that the rules are being kept , that we have the same purpose and keeping it to the play@@ end .
so the other thing that is en@@ ab@@ ling that is growing by atta@@ su@@ es , confidence and with each other .
as a result of that , we &apos;re building stron@@ ger social relationships .
happy produ@@ c@@ tivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of war@@ ror &apos;s player plays 22 hours a week , in a way , as part@@ -@@ time .
the reason is that , when we play , we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier to work hard than if we &apos;re doing comfort or doing nothing .
we know that as human beings do , as human beings do , when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right job .
and finally , epi@@ ani@@ cal importance .
players love to be a part of the out@@ come of the out@@ come of planet@@ ary planet@@ ar@@ an@@ ces .
here &apos;s a background of background in order to pull that in the right light , and you definitely know wikipedia , the greatest wi@@ ki in the world .
the second largest wi@@ ki in the world , with almost 8@@ 0,000 clu@@ ol@@ ings , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
and five million people are using it every month .
they &apos;ve put more information about the world of war@@ craft than over any other top@@ ic in every other wi@@ ki in every other wi@@ ki in the world .
they &apos;re creating an epi@@ c story .
they create an epi@@ c source of knowledge about the world of war@@ craft .
ok , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that lead to a single conclu@@ sion , and players are super@@ -@@ powerful , hop@@ e@@ ful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single one of the world .
and the only problem is that you think they can change virtual worl@@ ds , but not the real one .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
ed@@ ward ca@@ ens@@ o@@ va is a conser@@ ct scientist .
his work is brilliant . he &apos;s explor@@ ing why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worl@@ ds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be experi@@ en@@ cing less than a mass migra@@ tion in virtual worl@@ ds and online circu@@ its . &quot;
and that &apos;s one of the econom@@ ist . so he &apos;s logi@@ cal .
and he &apos;s saying ...
not like me -- i &apos;m designing games , i &apos;m a little bit more sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ing .
so he says this makes sense , in fact , because players can achieve more worl@@ ds than in real life .
they can make more stron@@ ger social bon@@ ds than in real life , and they get more feedback and re@@ wards in play than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s perfectly logi@@ cal at the moment that the times is more logi@@ cal in the virtual world than in the real world .
and i just wanted to do that , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
but it definitely doesn &apos;t be an op@@ tical situation .
and we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s coming back in a 2,@@ 500 years .
there are these ancient sau@@ ms , from she@@ et@@ lights , and you know , out of she@@ ets . you
in front of these magni@@ fi@@ cent games engineers , there were paper sc@@ ra@@ ps .
and these were kind of the first of people developed mes@@ h devices .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian , her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you may know this story , the story about how , and why games invented .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , a lot of contro@@ versi@@ al games , in the king@@ dom of ly@@ an , in the king@@ dom of fam@@ ine .
now there was such a great fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ di@@ es decided to be a crazy idea to a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people are strug@@ gl@@ ed .
it was an extreme situation . it needed you to do an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , the to@@ pe game , and they agre@@ ed a national strategy , and one day you would eat . the next day you &apos;d play .
and they &apos;d be so hum@@ bled in the bu@@ cket &apos;s game , because if we were so fascinating , and with satis@@ ble , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to have to eat .
and then , the next day , you &apos;d play . and the next day you &apos;d eat .
and her@@ od@@ ot@@ us survi@@ ved them for so 18 years , they ate fam@@ ine by a day and playing the next one .
just in the same way , i think , let &apos;s put games with games today .
we &apos;re enter@@ ing games to es@@ cape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re enter@@ ing games to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying in real life , and we &apos;re re@@ gar@@ ding ourselves what we need from playing .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
so that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us after 18 years , fam@@ ously not better , so the king decided to put a final piece of play .
they divi@@ ded the king@@ dom in two s@@ ells .
they played a wor@@ ker game , and the vie@@ wers were allowed to break up to an epi@@ phan@@ arian ad@@ vent@@ ure .
they dro@@ pped ly@@ di@@ es , and they made a look for a new home , and they &apos;d just come back with so many people to survive and watch with the rest of a region where they could be enga@@ ged .
that sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but the lat@@ est dna evidence shows that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ k , later , created the roman@@ mic string , the same dna as the old ly@@ di@@ ers .
and so scientists came up with a long time that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s wonderful story was actually true .
and ge@@ ologists found evidence of a global re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation that took almost 20 years , which may explain fam@@ ine .
so that &apos;s a crazy story to vote .
maybe they actually res@@ cu@@ ed their people by play by 18 years , and then they had this introdu@@ ction , and then they had a lot , and they learned so much about playing that they saved the entire civilization .
so , we can do that too .
we &apos;re playing war@@ way since 199@@ 4 war@@ craft .
this was the first strategy of engineering in real time in the world of war@@ cra@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
they were playing wor@@ tles for 18 years , and we &apos;re playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epi@@ c game .
so , they send half of their civilization looking for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion hours a week .
we should be trans@@ mit@@ ted by half of us a half a day per day , until we solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how are we going to solve problems of the real world ? &quot; and that question , i &apos;ve de@@ dic@@ ated my work in the project for the future in the last few years .
we have this ban@@ ner in our office in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it pres@@ ents the way we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before again .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we &apos;re going to introdu@@ ce the best results , and then people are em@@ power@@ ing to get this idea into reality .
we &apos;re going to introdu@@ ce epi@@ c vic@@ tory and give people the opportunity to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to create an epi@@ c vic@@ tory in their own future .
this is &quot; world without the oil without oil . &quot;
and the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to over@@ come an oil sc@@ ar@@ ri@@ st .
the oil p@@ ill is invented , but we have enough online content so that it &apos;s reali@@ stic for them , and they actually live their real life without oil . so , when they &apos;re sent to the game , they tell us where they live . and then they get news movies in real time trying to tell you how much oil costs , which is not how much oil costs , whether schools are closed , whether it &apos;s been closed . and they have to figure out how they &apos;re designing their real life , if it &apos;s true . and we ask them to be blog@@ ging about it , and we ask them to pay videos , or recor@@ ding videos or recor@@ ding . and we ask them to be blog@@ ging about it , and we ask them to vote on it , and we ask them to pay videos , or
we &apos;ve te@@ sted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed them for the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transforma@@ tive experience .
nobody wants to change your life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and they said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating ad@@ vent@@ ure that you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they would survive , and most of our players have commit@@ ted that in the game , the hab@@ its of the game .
so , for the next world head@@ ca@@ sting game , we &apos;ve got a greater , higher target than just oil sc@@ ar@@ city .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; super@@ bla@@ ct , &quot; in the institute for the future .
at the point of view , calcul@@ ating a super@@ computer is that people have only left a 3@@ 0-@@ year on the planet for three years .
this super@@ computer is called &quot; global survival &quot; propor@@ tion@@ ation , &quot; of course .
the call for the player to stand up , we &apos;ve done almost as a &quot; jer@@ r@@ y-@@ bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ om &quot; film .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ ess@@ master movies , where there are &quot; dre@@ am@@ -@@ team , &quot; they have the astron@@ au@@ ts , the scientists , the ex@@ -@@ be@@ am , and only together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just 5 people , say , everyone is in the dre@@ am@@ ar team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
ei@@ ght@@ ,000 players played the game eight weeks long .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they &apos;re &quot; super@@ bla@@ ct &quot; well gl@@ ory .
and the last game we &apos;re going to do on mar@@ ch 3@@ th . it &apos;s a game in partner@@ ship with the world bank .
if you conclu@@ de the game , you get the world bank , you get the emergen@@ ce of social care , you get in 2010 , 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universi@@ ties in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we &apos;re bringing them to learn social transforma@@ tion@@ ing .
we have a com@@ ic com@@ ic . we have &quot; level high &quot; for regi@@ onal understanding , knowledge , sustain@@ ability , vision and agen@@ cy .
i &apos;d like to invi@@ te all of you to share this game with young people around the world , throughout the world , particularly in the developing areas that benefit from their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world &apos;s social enter@@ pris@@ es
so , i &apos;ll go to the end .
i &apos;d like to ask you something .
what do you think is going on next ?
we have all these amazing players , and we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i &apos;m hop@@ ing that what i &apos;m hop@@ ing about is that gam@@ ers are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have all these super@@ power@@ s , happy produ@@ c@@ tivity , the ability to atta@@ ch close social networks , consi@@ sten@@ cy optimis@@ m , and that &apos;s what the real meaning is for epi@@ c importance .
i &apos;m really hop@@ ing that we play more powerful games to survive on this planet a more time .
and i hope you &apos;ll be designing with me like this with me like this .
in the next decade , when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m very sure about two things : that we can create any future future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i &apos;m saying , let &apos;s start the world shif@@ ting games !
thanks very much .
i &apos;d like to tell you something that i &apos;ve noticed a couple of months ago in writing with an itali@@ an article a few months ago .
i &apos;ve always been driving my syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary , but i was ready to work with the tex@@ ts , and i found that i &apos;ve never re@@ f@@ used to work in my life , and it occur@@ red to me that i haven &apos;t really ans@@ wer@@ ed my life , which
so i &apos;ll explain to you the introdu@@ ction .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , &quot; ad@@ je@@ ctive , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ eless , re@@ fin@@ ed , re@@ fin@@ ed , re@@ fin@@ ed , re@@ fin@@ ed , bur@@ ri@@ ri@@ zed , re@@ fin@@ ed , re@@ fin@@ ed , re@@ fin@@ ed , re@@ fin@@ ed , re@@ fin@@ ed , ar@@ ran@@ med , po@@ ster@@ ed , pain@@ t@@ ary , te@@ stam@@ di@@ ri@@ t sen@@ ge , el@@ ev@@ ated , stre@@ t@@ ched , stre@@ t@@ ched up from traffic , covered , broken , an@@ ger and we@@ ak and we@@ ak .
ant@@ ony@@ m : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend , and i had to lau@@ gh at the first time , it felt so ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but i was just coming to coun@@ t@@ less@@ ly , and i couldn &apos;t talk about it , and i had to stop reading , and i had to go and collect me with this kind of reas@@ on@@ able sau@@ ce , and the emotional of emotional sho@@ ck .
of course , this was a very , very old syn@@ ony@@ -@@ word dic@@ tion@@ ary , and i just thought that the ex@@ ecu@@ tion had to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy in the early 198@@ 0s when i was just starting to build element@@ ary school , and started to create my sense of self outside of my physical body , also in terms of other children and to the rest of the world around me .
and god , thank god , i didn &apos;t use syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ ary then .
if i was going to take this contra@@ ct seriously , i would be born into a world that would percei@@ ve someone like me as a person whose lives could be positive in any way , but now i &apos;m going to give the opportunity and ad@@ vent@@ ures and ad@@ vent@@ ures i &apos;ve ever experienced .
so , immediately i wrote the online copy of 2009 , and i was expected to find a promis@@ ing contribu@@ tion here .
so here &apos;s the sequen@@ tic version of this device .
well , it &apos;s not a lot better .
in particular , the last two words re@@ com@@ men@@ d me is &quot; near ant@@ ony@@ m &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that have in these words , and how we constru@@ ct these values .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking , and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the roman@@ c@@ us , really believed that the language of a flight has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about l@@ oud , is mani@@ fest .
so , what do we really want to mani@@ fest -- a dis@@ ab@@ led people , or a powerful person ?
just being described an ei@@ ght@@ ful person as a child , could be willing to con@@ stra@@ y them and conver@@ t them to engage them .
wouldn &apos;t it be kind of beautiful to open do@@ ors ?
a man who opened for me was my childhood doctor was at the a@@ .@@ i@@ . du@@ po@@ nt institute in wil@@ m@@ ing@@ ton in del@@ hi .
he &apos;s called dr. pi@@ zza &apos;s ti@@ ll@@ o . it &apos;s a it@@ al@@ o-@@ american whose name , as you can imagine , most americans couldn &apos;t talk exactly cor@@ rec@@ tly , so he &apos;s been called dr. p@@ . .
and dr. p@@ .@@ . , always used to fly very color@@ ful , and it was just created for children as well .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- ti@@ ll my physi@@ o@@ therapy therapy .
i had to be a single opportunity to repe@@ ee@@ ze infin@@ itely often with these cru@@ m@@ ble , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ ones -- in various colors -- that &apos;s what you know to build my leg mus@@ cles , and i hat@@ ed these be@@ at@@ ers more than anything else . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them . i hat@@ ed them .
and imagine if i actually did it as a five-@@ year-old kid with dr. p@@ .@@ d. , and so i tried to stop doing this practice , naturally without success .
and one day , he looked at me at one of my practic@@ es -- these practic@@ es were just ti@@ red and gl@@ ori@@ ty -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , ai@@ mee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to break one of these be@@ at@@ ers .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
it was just a very simple piece of dr. p@@ . so i was doing the practic@@ es that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the assu@@ mption that rob@@ ust five-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds were going to be in the hospital in the second floor , but he actually made me look at my daily career hor@@ ror with new eyes , and so it became a new and a new way of talking about it . it became a new and exciting experience .
and i &apos;m wondering how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl has sha@@ ped my self , and i could imagine how to see me as a very strong , powerful and at@@ le@@ th@@ ic human being .
so this is just one example of how adults can make the imagination of power in power posi@@ tions .
but how many examples of syn@@ ony@@ mous dic@@ tion@@ aries pres@@ ented us , our language doesn &apos;t give us a space to imagine what we all wish to do : to en@@ able anyone to see themselves as a powerful person .
our language assu@@ ps the social changes that have been avo@@ i@@ ded in many cases by a technologi@@ cal change .
from the medical point of view , you can say , of course , that my legs , the las@@ er surgery for visu@@ ori@@ ties , k@@ un@@ artic@@ -@@ artic@@ les of ti@@ tan@@ ium and artificial at@@ ts of ti@@ tan@@ ium and artificial at@@ tribu@@ tions for aging body that allow people to really use their natural dest@@ in@@ y , not to talk about the boundar@@ ies that define their natural dest@@ in@@ y , people allow themselves to define their identity , to define themselves in their own way , and to ori@@ ent the world to groups that they choose themselves .
so , maybe this technologi@@ cal change ten@@ ds to make sure that there &apos;s always been another truth , that there &apos;s always been another truth , nam@@ ely , that each person of society can be something very special and very powerful , and that the human ability to ada@@ pt , our biggest increase is our biggest .
the human sk@@ ill is to ada@@ pt -- this is an interesting story , because people are asking me to tell me how to engage with wi@@ ins , and i &apos;m going to tell you something : that sentence has never been familiar for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very un@@ comfortable to answer the questions of people , and i think , i think , i understand why .
so this is a sentence that lives with wi@@ ti@@ tu@@ tives from the idea that success or happiness depen@@ ds on solving a challenge , without being aware of being involved with the experience of the experience , as if my life has been able to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate the possibility of a life with a pro@@ s@@ thetic , or whatever people feel with me with my dis@@ ability .
but the truth is that we change . of course , we are em@@ bed@@ ded by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physi@@ cally , emotion@@ ally , emotion@@ ally , or even both .
and i just cla@@ im that it &apos;s good .
aff@@ plants are not a bar@@ rier that we need to cur@@ ve in order to deal better with our lives better .
hin@@ tions are just the way our lives are .
and i tend to be hin@@ ting as my sha@@ dow as my sha@@ dow .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s har@@ dly familiar , but he &apos;s constantly with me all the time .
and i don &apos;t want to do that unless the impact is to put up the sc@@ ar@@ f of a human being to the fight of a human
there are pl@@ ie@@ fs and challenges in life , and they &apos;re just about real , and each person &apos;s going to do it differently , but the question is not whether we come with wi@@ gen@@ ism or not , but how we &apos;re going to come with it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to preser@@ ve su@@ d@@ th@@ ers , but we also pre@@ p@@ are them to get a good thing to get a good thing
and we don &apos;t really like our kids , if we feel them that they can &apos;t ada@@ pt to them .
you have to exp@@ and two things : one of the medical fact is to be am@@ pu@@ t@@ ated , and to the other , the socie@@ tal concern@@ s of whether i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led or not .
and to be honest , the only real and en@@ ab@@ led dis@@ ab@@ led that i had to put myself apart is that the world is constantly meant to be expla@@ ining me with these defini@@ tions .
in our desire to protect people who are at heart and to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical predi@@ ction , or even a predi@@ ction to living , that they expect , we need to make sure we &apos;re not really dis@@ ab@@ led to the bottom that somebody is actually dis@@
maybe the actual concept that only is about what &apos;s wrong in a broken , and how we re@@ pair it , for each individuals , a greater dis@@ ability than path@@ ology itself .
if we don &apos;t treat a human people , not all of its forces and opportunities and recogni@@ zing , we create , in addition to the natural struggle , that you might have to lead , another disease .
we &apos;re de@@ gra@@ ding a man that has value for our society .
so we need to look beyond the pat@@ ch and focus on all the real@@ ms of human cap@@ abilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented and our magni@@ fi@@ cent agen@@ cies , a connection , conne@@ cts .
we should not den@@ y this explan@@ ation or den@@ den@@ ess , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them under the car@@ pet , but it &apos;s about recogni@@ zing in the wi@@ cations of the wi@@ cations .
it seems to me to make clear that we don &apos;t necessarily have to over@@ come wi@@ tations , but that we &apos;re open for it , but that we &apos;re open for it , to pack them on the che@@ a@@ f , to use a fight expression , and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we can do it , as something natural , familiar and useful and useful and feel like that , through their pres@@ ence , not so coun@@ ted by their pres@@ ence .
that year , we cele@@ br@@ ated the 200 and birth@@ day of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , has appe@@ ared to something very true in the human character .
i would write it this way : not the most powerful of his species survi@@ ved , not the most intelligent of its species , but the one that can ada@@ pt to change the best thing .
confli@@ cts come from confli@@ cts .
not only of dar@@ win@@ in &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and over@@ blo@@ wn , from the struggle of the human spirit , is determin@@ ed by conflict .
so , again , change and ada@@ pt are the greatest skills of people .
and we may not know what the bot@@ ms we &apos;re s@@ ni@@ gh@@ ted when we &apos;re really being te@@ sted .
in fact , that &apos;s exactly the sense of in@@ ference , a sense of the i@@ ph@@ a , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves a little bit of ourselves .
we can give aff@@ plants a new meaning that goes beyond a lot of times .
maybe we can see wi@@ ti@@ tu@@ des as change .
aff@@ pa@@ sts are for a change that we haven &apos;t agre@@ ed on yet .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve agre@@ ed to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
in fact , hon@@ est@@ ly -- who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal one .
there are the usual . the typical . but not the normal one , and would you really want to learn these poor , gra@@ y person , if they really would want to know it ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we think of this paradig@@ m pattern of normal versus the strength , or the strength to for@@ mu@@ late it even a little more dangerous , to exchange it , and so we can rele@@ ase the forces of very many kids , and invi@@ ting them to bring their special and pre@@ cious skills into society .
and what we &apos;ve found is that we &apos;ve always asked people from the members of our society , to be useful and contribu@@ ting to a contribu@@ tion .
there are evidence that even the ne@@ anderth@@ als in 6@@ 0,000 years ago , older people and people have car@@ ried with sever@@ e physical in@@ ju@@ ries , and this may happen , because the quality of life survival has been wor@@ th@@ ful for society &apos;s survival .
they haven &apos;t looked at these people as being broken and prof@@ it@@ less ; they were treated as something special and more valuable .
a few years ago , i walked up in the city where i grew up to a gro@@ und@@ ong market in the nor@@ the@@ ast of pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania , and i was standing there in front of a cock@@ per@@ ra@@ g to@@ ma@@ s there .
and it was summer , and i had stun@@ ts .
and i hear , as a guy behind me , he says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i turn around , and i see this el@@ der@@ ly man . i had no idea who he is .
and i was like , &quot; exc@@ use me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , they would bar@@ ely remember me . &quot;
when i first saw her , i &apos;d li@@ f@@ ted them out of her mother &apos;s bel@@ ly . &quot;
oh , so that &apos;s the thing .
and of course , it &apos;s made click , and of course .
this was dr. ke@@ an , a man that i had only known from my mother about this day because i , of course , was very typical , to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor pr@@ at@@ at@@ al diagno@@ sis of my mother was in vac@@ ation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , didn &apos;t .
and because i was born without a was@@ h legs , and my feet had finished , and i just had a couple of to@@ es on this and some to@@ es on the other foot , he was the chance to bring the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you could never walk , and never be so energi@@ zed like other kids or you could never lead an independent life , and since they were just going to lie me lying to me . &quot;
in fact , i found that he was colle@@ cting new@@ spa@@ pers of my entire childhood all of my childhood , whether i had won won i won in the second grade in the second class , whether i was running through the lan@@ der to hal@@ lo@@ ween , whether i had done my sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship or a member of my ath@@ le@@ d@@ ship , whether i had done my sch@@ ra@@ tic or one of my spor@@ ts students from ha@@ h@@ ne@@ a medical school and her@@ s@@ ch medical school .
and he called this part of his path the x factor , the potential of human will .
you can &apos;t just em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze enough how significant this factor of a human being can be a human .
and dr. ke@@ an continu@@ es to say , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t have anything else , and even if they &apos;re going to get kids out of themselves , then children can achieve a lot of money . &quot;
you see , dr. ke@@ an shif@@ ted his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagno@@ sis , and how someone goes through , two different things .
and also , i would change my thinking over time , if you &apos;d asked me in the age of 15 , if i &apos;d been color@@ ing my pro@@ s@@ thetic against legs and b@@ ones , i wouldn &apos;t have char@@ ted a second .
i really wanted to be normal at that time .
if you ask me about this today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve wit@@ n@@ essed something with my legs , rather than the experience of that experience .
and maybe that change could happen , because i &apos;ve wit@@ n@@ essed so many people who have opened do@@ ors , rather than meeting people who would li@@ mit me , or give me an idea of tran@@ scen@@ ding me
see , it really needs just one person who demon@@ strated them how to mani@@ fest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you en@@ able someone to activ@@ ate your own self-@@ inner forces -- the human mind is so re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ate -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people , then you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
and they teach them to open do@@ ors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; physi@@ gue &quot; is roots in the word &quot; edu@@ ardo . &quot;
it means to make something that &apos;s going to boun@@ ce the potential to sc@@ are the potential .
again , which is the potential that we want to do now , right ?
in the 196@@ 0s , a case study was done in the u.k. , after the time , kenya was trans@@ formed in a wide year of interest .
they call it &quot; re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ation , &quot; in the u.s. , we call this as &quot; tra@@ ce . &quot;
the students are divi@@ ded to gra@@ des .
and the one student is going to reve@@ al copy@@ und@@ ity , they get the better teachers , and so on .
they then gave students over a three-@@ month period of students who gave a &quot; concerned &quot; the note , &quot; and they were told they were legal they were very clever , and after those three months , they were actually writing a little bit of them .
and of course , it brea@@ ks to you the heart is that , again , sub@@ sequ@@ ently , the educ@@ ator is said , they &apos;re just suff@@ i@@ cient .
and it was exactly the same time after the three months , too .
but only those who were still in school -- apart from the students who had thro@@ wn the school .
and what &apos;s really cru@@ cial about this study was that teachers didn &apos;t get caught up .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that , you know , be the one-@@ student student and that are the students who are at the short time , and they &apos;ve taught them something and treated them .
the only real dis@@ ability is a broken mind that has been broken , has never been broken , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more beautiful . he thre@@ ars our natural , child@@ curi@@ osity , and our in@@ na@@ te ability to define the imagination .
if we can , however , we can continue to support the human spirit , to continue to experience themselves and other people around them beautiful , is curious and imag@@ in@@ ative , and then we &apos;re going to make our forces really positive .
if a spirit of these quali@@ ties have , we can create a new reality and new kinds of existence .
i want to end with a po@@ em that was nom@@ ined by a per@@ si@@ an po@@ et called ha@@ fi@@ ce in the 14@@ th century , and by which my friend jac@@ ques sig@@ bo@@ is tells me , and the po@@ em is called , &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows god , not the god of the name , &quot; not the god who knows about four words and repe@@ at them constantly repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , he just always says , come , stand , dance with me .
come on , come with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re currently right now ?
suppose i said , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory -- pre@@ c@@ isi@@ ve , more wise and faster .
or do you want to be more fit@@ ter , stron@@ ger , more power .
do you want to become more attra@@ ctive and more confi@@ dent ?
what would it be like to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who have always gradu@@ ally enga@@ ged for more creativity .
which one would you like to do ?
what would you like to have to have if you just could have one ?
creativity , creativity .
how many people would choose to choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me show you .
a few . probably about as many creative people here , there are some creative people here .
so that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose for a good memory ?
have a few more .
how about fit@@ ness , what about fit@@ ness ?
a couple of less .
what is with lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty ?
ah , the majority . i like to watch that , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of those , it would be a very different world .
is this all possible in terms of it ?
or is it perhaps possible ?
evolution has been a complete top@@ ic here on the ted conference , but today i &apos;d like to show you the view of a doctor &apos;s view .
the great gene@@ tic@@ ist in the 20th century , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ han@@ sky , who was also a commun@@ ant in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , wrote a paper , with the ti@@ tle , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in the evolution of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to switch your hearing device , take your own personal communication -- i &apos;ll give you per@@ mission -- and maybe you can get a look at ka@@ thr@@ yn schul@@ tz &apos;s book , which is to be wrong , because nothing else is going to make sense for you to do any sense for them .
but if you accept biological evolution , you assu@@ me : is it just about the past , or is it about the future , or is it about the future ?
is it true for other things , or is it true ?
this is another gli@@ mp@@ se of the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the re@@ vel@@ ations in all direc@@ tions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , all of the sudden exi@@ sting the bran@@ ches of these bran@@ ches of the bran@@ ches of these bran@@ ches in evolutionary terms : they have survi@@ ved fit@@ ness and strength .
the human part of this bu@@ g , far , is , of course , that &apos;s what we &apos;re most interested in .
we &apos;re bran@@ ching from a common ance@@ stry to modern chimpanze@@ es about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , maybe 20 or 25 different speci@@ les of hom@@ ini@@ ds had gone from hom@@
some of them have come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 13@@ 0,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re pretty remote from the other parts of life , but in fact , the biggest mechanis@@ ms , our cells are quite equal to our cells .
do you realize that we can take advantage of it and make the mechanis@@ ms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insu@@ lin@@ s , which is used to treat diab@@ e@@ tic ?
this is not like human@@ il@@ lin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemi@@ cally un@@ wh@@ el@@ med from what &apos;s coming out of the pan@@ cre@@ as .
and as we &apos;re talking about bacteria , we &apos;re aware that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads to cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times as many people .
i mean , do you think when ant@@ oni@@ o dama@@ si@@ o pres@@ ents your refle@@ ction , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a magni@@ fi@@ cent hospit@@ -@@ friend@@ ly environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s fir@@ m , it &apos;s very spi@@ se .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutri@@ ents that you could just wish without nee@@ ding your hand .
it &apos;s really a ligh@@ t@@ weight way for bacteria , with intro@@ duc@@ ing inter@@ depen@@ dence , je@@ od@@ ly forced forced to the ex@@ act edge .
but , if you &apos;re , you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for your life .
they &apos;re helping the di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on nutri@@ ents , and they &apos;re prote@@ cting them against certain diseases .
but what &apos;s going to come in in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um in the form of a species ?
or are we likely to be something else -- something that might even be more better to the environment ?
now , if we go back to the time of the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first indi@@ cations of living organisms , maybe three or four billion years ago on earth -- the first several or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , which has been repli@@ cated in the last &apos; 5@@ 0,000 years , has actually been repli@@ cated in the last 5@@ 0,000 years .
in this massive un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on earth is only equi@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed in the world , the animal king@@ dom , like a single click , and human life , a little note of con@@ ference .
that &apos;s what we were .
now , this introdu@@ ces the entertain@@ ment value of this talk , so i hope , here &apos;s why i hope , is , you know , d .
now , when i was a fres@@ h@@ man at college , i had my first biological biology clas@@ ses .
and i was fascin@@ ated by the elegan@@ ts and beauty of biology .
and i loved myself in the power of evolution , and i insi@@ sted something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in low-@@ life organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is continu@@ ing to continue in both dea@@ ar@@ e-@@ skin cells .
but at the time , as several species of organisms came up , things started to change .
so sexual re@@ production comes into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introdu@@ ction of sexual re@@ production , which is the genome pas@@ sing , the rest of the body is de@@ fe@@ st@@ it@@ ly sensitive .
in fact , what you might argue is that the inevi@@ table of the death of our body in evolution in the same moment is the same as the sexual rene@@ w@@ ship .
now i have to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex per death , sex per death , death , death , death -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s got my dou@@ bt dou@@ ble@@ ly .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george bur@@ ns , who introduced his show in las v@@ eg@@ as &apos;s show in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .
and one night , there &apos;s a th@@ um@@ p on his hotel room .
he op@@ ens up the door .
before him before him , it &apos;s a gor@@ ge@@ ous s@@ hr@@ in@@ king sho@@ w@@ man .
she looks at him and he says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super@@ -@@ sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the sou@@ p . &quot;
and i came to the reali@@ zation as a physi@@ cian that i was working with a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily consi@@ stent , just different .
i &apos;ve tried to preser@@ ve the body .
and i wanted to hold us healthy .
i wanted to re@@ store the health for a disease .
and i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the spread of the genome to the next generation of the next generation , ada@@ pt and survival generation .
so , from a evolutionary stand@@ point , you and i and i &apos;ve developed bo@@ ster rock@@ ets to send the gene@@ tic@@ al cla@@ tch to the next level of orbit , and then let &apos;s break down into the sea .
and i think we would all understand the mo@@ od , the tur@@ dy all the time , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve the in@@ mortality through my work .
i don &apos;t want to do it by the bar@@ bs . &quot;
evolution is not necessarily the lon@@ gest life to pre@@ fer the lon@@ gest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the biggest , the stron@@ gest or the fa@@ st@@ est , the fa@@ st@@ est , and not even the smar@@ test .
evolution explor@@ es the creatures that ada@@ pt to their own environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survi@@ ving and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that ther@@ m@@ op@@ hi@@ l are , and by the way , the hot ste@@ am survi@@ ves otherwise , if fish would be there , it would have vac@@ u@@ um coo@@ ked fish to the conclu@@ sion , but they &apos;ve been able to have a vi@@ able environment there for itself .
so , what does that mean when we look back , what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and most of all , as we look at the next phase , i would argue that there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to continue to evol@@ ve .
we have achie@@ ved a kind of equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
and the reason for that would be that we first had a lot of genes , managed to get a lot of genes that otherwise had been sel@@ ec@@ ted and out of the popu@@ lations .
and second , we as a species , we have con@@ fir@@ med our environment so that we &apos;ve managed to ada@@ pt to us , and we ada@@ pt to them as well as we fit them .
and by the way , we &apos;re going to wan@@ ting and collapse and we &apos;re doing so much that you can &apos;t tell longer that isol@@ ation is necessary , for evolution to address stat@@ ance .
the second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional species , of course , refer@@ ers by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here , is that the whe@@ el of evolution in evolution is slowly ma@@ sting , but they &apos;re aw@@ m@@ bling .
and so far as isol@@ ation comes out as a species of dist@@ ant planets , it will be isol@@ ated and the change of the environment that could produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third option , a comp@@ elling , fascinating and deli@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing possibility .
i call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just natural , but led and decided , as individuals , in the decisi@@ on-@@ making decisions we make .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we could do this ?
let &apos;s take a look at the reality that people are doing decisions in some cultures in some cultures , in some cultures .
they are , in some cultures , the ele@@ ction to have more men than they have women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the one and the family choo@@ ses .
so think , if it &apos;s not just possible to pick your child &apos;s gender , but also to adop@@ t genetic adap@@ tations , to conser@@ ve and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic change to elimin@@ ate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or alzheimer could elimin@@ ate cancer risk or stro@@ ke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it to make these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re looking at , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 199@@ 0 , and it took 13 years old .
it cost 2.@@ 7 billion doll@@ ar@@ s-@@ worth .
the following year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in it in one to four months .
today , you can see a sequence of three billion base pa@@ irs of the human genome to a price of about 20@@ ,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time until the reality will be , that there will be the 1,000 dollars of human genom@@ es , and it will be increasingly available to anyone .
a week ago , at the national acade@@ my of engineering , the national acade@@ my of engineering for fran@@ c@@ is ar@@ n@@ old and wil@@ lem ste@@ cker , two scientists who developed indepen@@ dence from other techniques that encoura@@ ge the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to aff@@ ord@@ able proteins in a more efficient way -- which is called fran@@ land ar@@ n@@ old &apos;s &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the las@@ er prize , the scientist sh@@ in@@ ya y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a agre@@ ed for his research in which he took a therap@@ al skin , a fi@@ bro@@ sis , and through the manipu@@ lation of only four genes , the cell indu@@ ted to take it to a plu@@ ri@@ po@@ tent stem cell -- a cell poten@@ tially able to be able to become perman@@ ent cell in your body .
and these changes are coming in .
the same technology that produ@@ ces human insu@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just prote@@ cted in itself , but also to produce the imm@@ unity against other viruses .
whether or not you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experiment@@ al study in the gang with influ@@ acc@@ a that has been built in the cells of a tab@@ a@@ v@@ ine of a tab@@ a@@ v@@ ine .
can you imagine a good thing that comes from to@@ bac@@ co ?
this is all true today , and in the future today , it &apos;s going to be a lot more possible .
now , just imagine two other little things .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your des@@ cen@@ dan@@ ts ?
what if they could change the sper@@ m and protein , or the fresh ferti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g , to give your kids a better chance for a healthy life -- elimin@@ ation of diabetes , the he@@ m@@ op@@ mo@@ c@@ ence , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be heal@@ thi@@ er children ?
and then the analy@@ tical techni@@ que , the same engine of science that can en@@ able the change to prevent disease , could allow us to be able to adop@@ t super@@ -@@ at@@ tribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ e@@ pa@@ gation -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the sc@@ ar@@ ri@@ ty of a ken mountain mountain , especially if you can exp@@ and it &apos;s the next generation of the wat@@ e machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fi@@ bers that will be able to make them run faster and longer ?
why no longer life live ?
these are going to be ir@@ lin@@ able .
and if we are at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the at@@ tribu@@ tes we want , we will be trans@@ formed from al@@ t complexity evolution to ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that &apos;s probably meant to be 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it to thousands of years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that have to be their grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children .
are we going to en@@ able these decisions a society that is better , the more successful , is the most friend@@ er ?
or will we choose more sel@@ ec@@ tively different at@@ tribu@@ tes that we want to have for some of us , and not for other of us ?
are we going to be a society forms of di@@ vor@@ ce and more uni@@ qu@@ isi@@ te , or rob@@ ust and so many str@@ angel@@ y things ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
and most of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom ma@@ sters that we &apos;re going to need to make in order to make these decisions ?
in the good way of evil , and before you might think , these choices are going to be in us .
thank you very much .
so i want you to imagine something , a port@@ able robot that is recogni@@ zed to give you a human@@ -@@ human ability , or another , the wheel@@ chair wor@@ ker helps to stand up and go back .
and we at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y bi@@ on@@ ics , we call these robots ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ ons .
they &apos;re nothing else than something you &apos;re putting up in the morning , and that &apos;s what makes you extra strength , and that &apos;s going to increase your vel@@ o@@ city , and that &apos;s going to help you to keep your balance
in fact , that &apos;s the real ra@@ pe of human and machine .
but it &apos;s not just that -- it &apos;s fu@@ ri@@ ating and inter@@ acting with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers , who is giving about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s a question that they should wear more equipment .
and of course , this leads to some major compli@@ cations -- back in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of it -- chr@@ onic spin@@ en@@ cing in@@ ju@@ ries .
so we thought that we would be able to embra@@ ce this challenge and create an ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introdu@@ ce you to h@@ ul@@ c -- or the human universal ec@@ car@@ r@@ ers .
soldi@@ er : with the h@@ ul@@ c@@ -@@ ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on , i can carry 200 pounds across different ter@@ rain , a lot of hours .
it &apos;s a flexi@@ ble design that allows you to b@@ low deep , deep to heat , and to lead to hot mov@@ ements . &quot;
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then my strength and resili@@ ence .
we &apos;re so far , with our industrial partner this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on in this year .
so , it &apos;s true .
let &apos;s now take our look at the wheel@@ chair fir@@ ms , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 6@@ 8 million people who are being infe@@ cted in the wheel@@ chair in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conser@@ va@@ tive esti@@ ma@@ tion .
and we &apos;re talking a lot about very young people with spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury , who are in the b@@ ength of their lives -- 20@@ er , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- being hit by dest@@ in@@ y and the wheel@@ chair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , its number is multi@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly multi@@ pli@@
and pretty much the only option -- when it comes to a brain level , or the other compli@@ cations -- is the wheel@@ chair .
and so , by the way , 500 years since , i &apos;ve got to say , is very successful introdu@@ ction .
so we thought that we could start to write a whole new chap@@ ter in mo@@ bility .
now , let me introdu@@ ce you with apple bo@@ x@@ sen , which is car@@ ried by am@@ anda bo@@ x@@ tel , who suff@@ ered a spin@@ al cor@@ d in@@ j@@ ury that has been able to run a spin@@ al cor@@ d for 19 years and so far .
thank you very much .
as i said , am@@ anda affec@@ ts our eleph@@ ory .
it &apos;s got sensor@@ s .
his completely non-@@ invasi@@ ve sensor@@ s in the hall@@ s , the signals back back to our on@@ bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ based computer , which is atta@@ ched on your back .
and these are also battery pac@@ ks , and the engine is pul@@ ling on your hi@@ ps , as well as to your k@@ nee jo@@ kes , which you &apos;re moving forward in this very smo@@ oth and very natural gan@@ g@@ way .
i was 24 years old and in the white form of a mon@@ str@@ ous pur@@ ve tree during a sk@@ un@@ k of sk@@ en@@ k .
in a fra@@ ction of one second , i lost every feeling , and every movement below my be@@ ak@@ age .
not long after that long after i was a doctor , and he said , &quot; am@@ anda , you &apos;re never going to go back . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s the steel of every five of my consciousness from my consciousness .
adap@@ table technologies have been able to learn to try to learn and sk@@ et@@ ch again , to clim@@ b , and even driving with the hands of whe@@ el .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back , until now .
thank you very much .
and as you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to meet us and argue with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got all the potential here to change life &apos;s life -- not just for the soldiers , or for am@@ anda here , and all the wheel@@ chair dri@@ vers , but for all .
thank you very much .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a director of the development department of a non@@ profit organization called ro@@ bin blan@@ k .
if i don &apos;t plan poverty , i farm as a company &apos;s help of a fire@@ man on a volunte@@ er del@@ age .
now , in our city , in which volunte@@ ers , volunte@@ ers have been suppor@@ ted , you have to be very early at the brand scene to be able to be able to be able to com@@ pose with com@@ pla@@ int .
and i remember my first fir@@ es .
i was the second volunte@@ ers on the mountain , so i had a pretty good opportunity to be able to inv@@ ent .
but it was still a struggle against the other volunte@@ ers to meet the accoun@@ t@@ ary of the main man and find out what our tas@@ ks would be .
when i found the main man , he just had a very serious conversation with the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ der , who had certainly one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was standing in the bat train and bar@@ bs under a screen , and her house was in fl@@ ames , and her house was in fl@@ ames .
the other volunte@@ ers who came up in front of me -- call him le@@ x lu@@ ther -- got the prime man first , and was asked to go to the house , and to save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was so far more l@@ oud .
there was a law@@ yer or a pro@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce or a cure , who now told the rest of his life , to tell people that he was in a burning house to save a living living living , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the main man win@@ ds me up to me .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up , and you have to go over the fire , and you have to get this woman a pair of shoes .
i swe@@ ar to it .
now , not exactly what i was hop@@ ing about , but i went to -- the sta@@ irs up , the hall@@ way , the hall@@ way , on the real fire@@ men , who were just ready to get in the bedro@@ om at that point , to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i wor@@ e my pre@@ y back , standing on the door of my sil@@ ent , and i met the belo@@ ved dog .
we put our cla@@ ims outside to the hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his more attention came from me than mine .
a few weeks later , the fire@@ was@@ h would get a letter of hou@@ se@@ hol@@ ds , where they were doing their house with the res@@ cu@@ e of their house .
one of the most respe@@ c@@ tious kin@@ dness : someone had brought her a pair of shoes .
so , both in my career at ro@@ bin &apos;s sin@@ as and my end career as a volunte@@ er , i &apos;m wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed by gener@@ osity and kin@@ dness in the big scale , but i also see the embra@@ ce and the mu@@ ts of individuals .
and do you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i look around this room and see people who either have achie@@ ved a significant success or on their way there , i &apos;d like to offer the memory of memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to wait a difference in the life of another , until you have achie@@ ved your first million .
if you give you something , you &apos;ll give it it now .
if you &apos;re in a sou@@ d@@ ball , you &apos;re going to go to a park kitchen , you &apos;re in the neighborhood .
be a ment@@ or@@ or .
not every day will give us a chance to save the lives of a human , but every day we give us a chance to change one .
so they get rid of it ; they save the shoes .
thank you very much .
br@@ un@@ o gu@@ is@@ san@@ i : mark , mark , come back .
thank you very much .
so i just came back from a community that knows the secret of the progress of humanity .
a place in which women are doing the regul@@ ator with sex &apos; clock , and the game requires the day -- where is fun is a serious thing .
and no , it &apos;s not fan@@ man or san francisco .
ladies and gentle@@ men , their rela@@ tion@@ ing .
this is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s at the western fore@@ sts of con@@ go .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are combin@@ ed with chimpanze@@ es of our ne@@ ar@@ est living rela@@ tives .
that means we have a shared ance@@ st@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now the chimpanze@@ es are known for their ag@@ gressi@@ ve agen@@ cy .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve over@@ fit@@ ted this very clo@@ sely in the narra@@ tive of human evolution .
but bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s give us the other side of the me@@ d@@ al
as chimpanze@@ es are done by large , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed c@@ ots , the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ society &apos;s developed by em@@ power@@ ed fe@@ males .
they &apos;ve been looking at something like this , because this leads to an exc@@ ell@@ ent toler@@ ant society , where vulnerable violence has not been obser@@ ved .
but unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least known among the pri@@ mates .
they &apos;re living in the dep@@ ths of the con@@ gol@@ ese ur@@ yer , and they &apos;re just hard to get to the obser@@ vation .
the con@@ go is an parado@@ x -- a country of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dar@@ k@@ ness itself -- the scop@@ e of a violent argument that has been killed for decades and has contribu@@ ted to as many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction also is the survival of the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s .
and meat capture and the dec@@ line of the pi@@ meter lead to that you can &apos;t even fill a sta@@ dium with the l@@ ength of bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- and even there &apos;s no good there to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a loss of herr@@ ing , that the trees are sh@@ red@@ ded .
who are these relative ones ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , because they have a lot of times , bis@@ ex@@ ual sex , with inter@@ acting part@@ ners , and rules like confli@@ cts and social creatures . &quot;
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all human@@ it@@ arian problems -- because life &apos;s life is more than the cam@@ o@@ bo@@ s life .
bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s -- like people -- love to play their lives for a time .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children games .
for us , and it &apos;s a game of play for the atta@@ ch@@ ment of relationships and nur@@ turing of toler@@ ance .
this is how we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play and resili@@ ence makes creativity and resili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of inter@@ actions , diversity of connections , diversity of connections .
and if you look at bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s at the game , you see the evolutionary orig@@ ins of human la@@ kes , dance and ritu@@ als .
play is the gl@@ ue that kee@@ ps us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i &apos;d like to show you some unique foot@@ age straight out of the wild .
first , a ball@@ game on bon@@ o@@ bo art -- and i don &apos;t think about foot@@ foot@@ ball .
so here we see a young female and a male &apos;s game in a play game .
take a look at what she does .
this may be the evolutionary orig@@ in of , &quot; you put it in the eg@@ gs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
yeah !
so sex games are distribu@@ ted , both in bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and in humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ide@@ al order where you get new elements into play -- like the te@@ stes -- and also how the game requires both confidence and fun@@ ds -- while it &apos;s extremely fun at the same time that it &apos;s extremely fun at
but the game is a form of for@@ it@@ ure .
play is a for@@ mul@@ er , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which are more quie@@ t , fan@@ t@@ arian , curious -- maybe just to dete@@ ct the won@@ t again .
and i want to show you , this is fu@@ k@@ u , a young fe@@ males , and they &apos;re be@@ ac@@ efully with water .
i think the way they play sometimes sometimes , and we &apos;re alone , and we &apos;re out of our inner worl@@ ds and outside worl@@ ds .
and it &apos;s this play@@ ful curi@@ osity that makes us explore and interact , and the un@@ expected connections that we form are the real amount of creativity in creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insi@@ ght that bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s off@@ ers us in our past and pres@@ enting pres@@ sur@@ es .
but it &apos;s also a myster@@ y for our future , a future where we have to ada@@ pt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity and plastic and plastic en@@ for@@ c@@ ently en@@ for@@ c@@ ently .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills of skills .
in other words , play is our adap@@ table jo@@ ker .
to ada@@ pt to us success@@ fully to an un@@ sustainable world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best out of our play@@ work ?
play is not ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
it &apos;s cru@@ cial .
for bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and people equ@@ ally , life is not made from teeth and cla@@ ws alone .
even if it &apos;s har@@ dly appropriate , play may be the most important thing .
and so , my pri@@ mates , let &apos;s embra@@ ce this gift of evolution and play with this gift , while we re@@ discover creativity to the auth@@ ori@@ ties and the de@@ fau@@ lt .
thank you very much .
i want you to imagine two pa@@ irs , in the mid@@ - 197@@ 9 , exactly exactly the same day , exactly the same moment , every single baby -- okay .
so two pa@@ irs , every single one is a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to take too much time to imagine fusion , because if you think about it all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
just think of that for a moment .
and in this scen@@ ari@@ o , imagine that , in a case , the sper@@ ma is a great ch@@ om@@ o@@ so@@ me that hits the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
and in the other case , the sper@@ m is an x chromo@@ some that hits on the x chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
both of them are survi@@ vor@@ able , both of them .
we &apos;re going to come back on these people later .
most of my activi@@ ties , i &apos;ve got two sh@@ ots on it .
but under a hat , i &apos;m working with the story of an@@ atom@@ y .
i was a histor@@ ian , and in this case , i &apos;m looking at how people went through an@@ atom@@ y -- that &apos;s , human bodies , animal bodies , animal bodies -- how they &apos;ve actually thought of body flu@@ ids , with the body concep@@ ts , as you &apos;ve thought about the body .
the other hu@@ t that i &apos;ve been carrying with my work is the activ@@ ist , as a patient law@@ yer -- or , as i sometimes say , as im@@ patient , as im@@ patients -- by people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people , the body guys , asking the social nor@@ ms .
and so , for example , i &apos;ve worked with people who are si@@ am@@ arian tw@@ ins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with z@@ il@@ gen@@ ous farmers -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with inter@@ sexual people whose gender , whose gender is at@@ yp@@ ic -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the word of inter@@ sexu@@ ality for this .
inter@@ f@@ ance comes up in a lot of different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples of gender vari@@ ations that don &apos;t respond to the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have someone with a x@@ y chromo@@ som@@ e-@@ wide basis , and the s@@ ry of the y ch@@ om@@ o@@ da comes up the proto@@ gen that we all have the fe@@ ro@@ c sta@@ dium , and we &apos;re all growing up to te@@ sti@@ cles .
and that &apos;s why the te@@ stes give te@@ ds in the fe@@ al stage te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
but because this individual is missing the re@@ cep@@ tor to dete@@ ct the te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t respond to te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
and that &apos;s called and@@ ro@@ gen@@ e@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ c@@ ating .
so , a lot of te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , but there &apos;s no reaction to that .
as a con@@ sequence , the body develop@@ s more of the typical female in terms of it .
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it usually takes until you get the pu@@ ber@@ ty and grow your brea@@ sts and you develop your brea@@ sts , but you don &apos;t get your peri@@ o@@ de until someone &apos;s going to be something different here .
and they &apos;re doing some tests , and they find that instead of drin@@ ks and cont@@ identi@@ al , in fact , they get sti@@ cks in it and they have a y chromo@@ some .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of this person for a particular person , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ c@@ ens , called ad@@ ren@@ al@@ in@@ c@@ ens .
they &apos;re in the back of your body .
and the side kid@@ ney people have ro@@ oms , which are vi@@ ri@@ li@@ zing hor@@ mon@@ es .
most of the women , as i am -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromo@@ som@@ a , but i think i probably have the compar@@ e -- most women like i &apos;m actually talking about and@@ ro@@ gens in the world .
we produce and@@ ro@@ ws , and we &apos;re talking to and@@ ro@@ gens .
the con@@ sequence is that somebody like me actually had a brain that has more and@@ ro@@ gens than a woman who was born with te@@ ds , and has a and@@ ro@@ cra@@ tor de@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ ct .
so , the gender is really complicated ; everyday sexual math is not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be surro@@ unded throughout the entire band@@ wid@@ th .
another example : a few years ago , i got the phone call of a 19 year-old girl who was born as a boy , and he had a friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , lived as a man , and he had just figured out that he had a fish car@@ e and a for@@ ter@@ us .
he had a huge form of a na@@ tive side of the side of the side of hyper@@ blood .
it has taken x@@ x chromo@@ , and in the wom@@ b , his side was so strong that they basically created a male hor@@ mon@@ ary environment .
and as a con@@ sequence , his gen@@ it@@ als were male , his brain was ex@@ posed to the typical male part of the hor@@ mon@@ al spectrum spectrum .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one kid@@ sed something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he had gotten enough medical problems , in fact , because he was inter@@ hi@@ sting that the doctors found that he was in the inner world .
okay , just a quick example of a vari@@ ation of inter@@ sexu@@ ality .
some people with x@@ x chromo@@ som@@ es , something called o@@ state dar@@ is , is blo@@ wn out of den@@ tic tis@@ su@@ es of den@@ se tissue .
we don &apos;t exactly know why this is happening .
so , the gender can occu@@ r in a lot of different var@@ ie@@ ties .
the reason that children with this kind of body -- whether or not it &apos;s reti@@ red adults or si@@ ce tw@@ ins , whether it &apos;s inter@@ hab@@ enti@@ al -- from surge@@ ons are often being placed to the nor@@ m , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s for their physical health of benefit .
in a lot of cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
and the reason why they often do have different kinds of surgery in a lot of surgery is because they thre@@ aten our social categ@@ ories .
in fact , our system is based on the idea that a certain an@@ atom@@ ical occu@@ r is associated with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman has to have a female identity , is to be a black person , is to be a black person , is to have a modern an@@ atom@@ y in terms of their own history .
so , we have this horri@@ ble simpli@@ stic idea .
and when we &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with a body , which is actually something very different for us , this is what we &apos;re consum@@ ing in terms of this categ@@ ori@@ zation .
so in our culture , we have a lot of roman@@ tic ideas about individu@@ alism .
and our nation really pres@@ cri@@ ma@@ zes a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , who are two people in a body .
when i first experienced most of the pres@@ ent@@ ations , the south african run@@ ner in ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya last year , whose gender had been asked at the lei@@ s@@ at@@ le@@ s@@ ology last year , in ber@@ lin .
many journ@@ alists called me with the question : &quot; which is , &quot; what test will you do that tells us if ca@@ ster se@@ men@@ ya is poor@@ ly or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journ@@ alists that there &apos;s not a test that test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit that nature doesn &apos;t have to ad@@ mit the gap between male and ir@@ ly , or between male and inter@@ gender and fa@@ i@@ cially , we are the ones that make that separ@@ ation line as naturally .
so , we have a situation like that , where the further our science advan@@ ces , we have to tell ourselves that these categ@@ ories that we &apos;ve been asked for stable an@@ atom@@ ic categ@@ ories , which resul@@ ted very simple conver@@ sa@@ tions to create perman@@ ent identity circu@@ ums , far more fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing than we &apos;ve anti@@ ci@@ rop@@ ed .
and that &apos;s not just about gender in gender .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which consi@@ ds as much more complicated than our ter@@ min@@ ology has ad@@ mit@@ ted
when we looked at our vie@@ ws , we started in all sorts of un@@ conven@@ gu@@ ary areas .
so , for example , we &apos;re stru@@ cking up at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanze@@ es in the first place .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them just by a little nuclear nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ de ?
while we continue to exp@@ and our science further , we get increasingly into a zone of dis@@ comfort , where we need to recognize that the simpli@@ stic categ@@ ories that we had probably had too simple .
we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of different parts of human life .
one of the areas that we &apos;re looking at that , in our modern culture today , in the united states today , are the struggle over the beginning and the end of life , are the struggle of life
we have tough conver@@ sa@@ tions about which point becomes a body for a human , so that he has another right than the fe@@ tal life .
we now have very difficult con@@ tex@@ ts today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- asking about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
you &apos;d have someone who had a li@@ mit under the nose , and when they moved around , they didn &apos;t have to bur@@ y them yet .
if they didn &apos;t move up , you &apos;d be bu@@ ried them .
but today , we &apos;re now in a situation where we &apos;re going to de@@ f@@ end people &apos;s li@@ vi@@ c organs , and they want to ferti@@ li@@ ze them other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re following the fight with the really hard question when someone is dead , and it brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have as simple categ@@ ories as we did before .
now , you might assu@@ me that all of the categ@@ ories of categ@@ ory would be really happy to make me happy .
i &apos;m poli@@ tically pro@@ gressi@@ ve , i &apos;m prote@@ cting people with unusual bodies , but i have to ad@@ mit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categ@@ ories are really far less inse@@ cure than we thought , it makes me look forward .
and it appe@@ ars to me in terms of how democracy is consi@@ der@@ ing democracy .
so to tell you about that sugge@@ sti@@ on , i have to first know that i &apos;m a big fan of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers .
and i know they were ra@@ ti@@ ti@@ sts , i know they were sex@@ i@@ sts , but they were great .
and i find that they were so strong and strong , and so radical , and so radical , in which they were doing me to look at the s@@ nap@@ tt@@ y em@@ bas@@ sy of 17@@ 7@@ 6 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely for@@ gotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the emergen@@ ce fa@@ thers .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were from my view of the original an@@ atom@@ ical activi@@ sts , and that &apos;s why it was .
and what they came back was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and they built it through another , which was radi@@ cally and beautiful , and it was meaning@@ -@@ year-@@ year for us to be sc@@ ared .
and as you all remember , our fo@@ unding fa@@ thers re@@ je@@ cted the concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was based on a very simpli@@ fied concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
the red@@ all@@ ers of the ancient world had no concept on the dna , but they had a very idea of the birth on the right .
they had a blue blood concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had the political power should have to make this political power because of the cont@@ amin@@ ant blood line from grand@@ father for the father and so on .
the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers get this idea back and created them through a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and this concept said that all humans had been created equ@@ ally .
and they ni@@ vel@@ ed the game field , and they decided that an@@ atom@@ ically , the common@@ ness coun@@ ts , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now they made that part , because they were part of an en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ing system where two things grew together .
the democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science also grew up .
and if you look at the history of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , the fact that many of you are very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a kind of islam@@ ali@@ stic world .
and they went away from explan@@ ations virtu@@ ally , and they measu@@ red things like a super@@ natural concept of power , back , where the trans@@ mission on a very va@@ sty concep@@ ts of birth is based on its ground .
they moved to a sort of a natural concept .
and if you look at most of the time indepen@@ dence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and the nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they made us a concept that had an@@ atom@@ ic common@@ ali@@ ties .
and they &apos;ve done a really wonderful way of prepar@@ ing the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened for years after that ?
so , for example , women who attra@@ ct the elec@@ lt , the concept of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers , which says that an@@ atom@@ ical is more important than the an@@ atom@@ ical difference , and said , &quot; that we have an intern@@ al and in@@ struc@@ tive gra@@ il as a difference , and said , &quot; that we don &apos;t have an intern@@ al and in@@ struc@@ tive gra@@ il as a difference , etc . , etc , etc . &quot;
and women repor@@ ted that success@@ fully .
and the next thing was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people write like so@@ cab@@ et@@ kee@@ pers talking about , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we &apos;re finding men in the mar@@ g@@ ins of the citi@@ zen char@@ ity , which say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have different skin paint , which consi@@ ders in an@@ atom@@ ical common@@ through@@ s of an@@ atom@@ ical differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing at the dis@@ ab@@ led legal movement .
and of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all of the common@@ ali@@ ties , we have to ask questions about why we &apos;re going to main@@ tain certain dis@@ connect .
well , gran@@ ted , i would like to main@@ tain certain separ@@ ators , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
i want to say , for example , a fish is not the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the an@@ atom@@ y .
i &apos;m not going to say five year-@@ ol@@ ds should have the right to give your assu@@ mp@@ tions to sex or to be married .
so , there are some an@@ atom@@ ical dis@@ connect that make sense for me , and that we think should be keeping .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what they are and why we stay them , and whether they &apos;re meaning@@ ful .
so , coming back to these two creatures that have been given at the beginning of the talk .
we &apos;ve had two creatures , both in 197@@ 9 , the same day .
imagine that one of them , mar@@ ia has been born three months , so it &apos;s born at a jun@@ e 19@@ 80 in 19@@ 80 .
h@@ ein@@ rich , on the other hand , is born to the prime m@@ in , so he &apos;s born at one one of mar@@ ch 19@@ 80 .
just because of the fact that mar@@ ia was born three months , they &apos;re doing all sorts of rights three months before h@@ ein@@ rich -- to have the right to have sex , to have the right to drink the right , to drink the right .
h@@ ein@@ rich has to wait on all this , not because he actually has another biological age , only because he has actually had another biological age of his birth .
we find other other od@@ di@@ ties of what their rights are .
h@@ ein@@ mer , because you &apos;re supposed to assu@@ me that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s with x@@ y -- because you assu@@ me that he &apos;s a male , he can now be re@@ placed what mar@@ ia doesn &apos;t need to worry about .
now , mar@@ ia , not in all states , can &apos;t believe the same thing that h@@ ein@@ rich in all states has , and that &apos;s the right thing to mar@@ ry the right .
h@@ ein@@ rich can tell a woman in every state , but mar@@ ia can only mar@@ ry a woman in a few states today .
so , we have this perman@@ ent an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that are more proble@@ matic and questi@@ on@@ able in many ways .
and to me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is going to make progress in the area of an@@ atom@@ y , that we get to a point where democracy that beha@@ ves in an@@ atom@@ y might fall from an@@ atom@@ y , could be there ?
i don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it feels like that , sometimes the science is self-@@ depen@@ dent .
so where are we going to do ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pra@@ g@@ matic position : &quot; well , we have to pull a line anywhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them anywhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are going to go in a very strange position .
so for example , texas at one point decided that , at one point , texas means hot , that you don &apos;t have a y chromo@@ some , and to mar@@ ry a woman means that you have a y chromo@@ some .
now , in practice , people aren &apos;t te@@ sted on their chromo@@ .
but it &apos;s also very bizar@@ re , because of the story i first told you about the and@@ ro@@ cra@@ tion de@@ cep@@ tor de@@ fe@@ st@@ ator .
if we look at one of the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , dr. martin lu@@ ther king , he off@@ ers us in his &quot; i have a dream of talking , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we shouldn &apos;t talk about &quot; your skin color , &quot; but jud@@ ging the property of their character , &quot; and goes beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
and i &apos;d like to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
now , how do you do that in practice ?
how do you ju@@ dge people in terms of their characteri@@ stics ?
i also want to point out that i shouldn &apos;t be safe that we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of people , because i have to ad@@ mit that i know a series of golden re@@ tri@@ ever , which probably deser@@ ves so@@ und@@ ly than some of the people i know .
i would like to argue that i &apos;m probably familiar with some bright lab@@ els that are capable of more capable , intelligent , intelligent and en@@ danger@@ ing decisions about their sexual relationships than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that i know .
so , how should we operate the question of the characteri@@ stics of the character ?
it turns out to be a really hard way .
and one part of me was wondering , what if the content of a person@@ ality would be something that would be a machine read@@ on@@ able in the future -- could be made by f@@ mr@@ i visible visible ?
do we really want to go into that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to make thoughts about democracy &apos;s questions .
and in our way around democracy , we &apos;ve done really well , and i think we &apos;d be doing good things in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran , in iran , where a man who is sex@@ ually attra@@ cted to other men , it &apos;s pun@@ ished , because he is willing to inter@@ se@@ ct a heal@@ ing form , in which case he &apos;s going to stay alive .
the conditions of these species are not going to exist .
and i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these conditions -- a surge@@ on that i talked to a few years ago , who had been brought up some si@@ tically tw@@ ins , to separate them , in part , to make a name , in part , to make
but when i started with him , and he asked why he made these interven@@ tions -- it was highly ris@@ i@@ ous sur@@ ger@@ ies -- his response was that in his country , these kids would be very poor@@ ly treated , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
and i said to him , &quot; well , do you have poli@@ cy political as@@ y@@ l instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they are , without having them change the state of the state .
that &apos;s why i think we need to be a leader .
well , just to conclu@@ de , i just want to tell you that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fa@@ thers .
and i &apos;d like to think about the possibility of what democracy might look like , or look , if we had to do the mothers more about the mothers .
and i want to say something that is radical for a fe@@ min@@ ist , which is something radical , and that i think that there may be different ways of intro@@ duc@@ ing from various types of an@@ atom@@ y , especially when people interact a group of group .
for years , because i &apos;ve been interested in commun@@ ality , i &apos;ve also been interested in a lot of gender in the gender of gender
and one of the things that i really found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
in fact , what we &apos;ve learned from the under@@ ground studies is that women , on average -- not every , but the average -- but the average -- more to be wise social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable in the group , are a lot of attention to people who are
and that &apos;s why , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i was educ@@ ating a graduate school , one of my graduate teachers asked me in fe@@ min@@ ism -- i looked at myself as a fe@@ min@@ ist , and i was doing it -- a really serious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what fe@@ min@@ ism is becoming female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard of .
in fe@@ min@@ ism , it &apos;s about re@@ duc@@ ing stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about gender , so fe@@ min@@ ism isn &apos;t resi@@ stant .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that there might be some female in fe@@ min@@ ism .
it &apos;s meant to be something that could be something , on average , which is , in average , that male brains diff@@ er to us from the very sophisti@@ cated social relationships , and awareness for it for the prote@@ ctive need to worry about .
so where the fo@@ unding fa@@ thers were extremely accu@@ rate about how individuals could be prote@@ cted before individuals before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we em@@ bed@@ ded more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re not just being prote@@ cted , we &apos;re not just prote@@ cting , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it is that we &apos;re going to be in the future when we &apos;re doing democracy about an@@ atom@@ y -- less about the individual body thinking less about the individual body of identity , and thinking more about relationships .
so that , as a people , as people try to make a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m j@@ ess@@ i , and this is my su@@ it@@ case , right ?
but before i show you , what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to do a very public commit@@ ment , and that &apos;s , i &apos;m obs@@ essed with the out@@ f@@ its .
i love to find each other a different kind of color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit , to be able to get crazy out@@ its , and also to photograph and blog and blog .
but i don &apos;t buy a new one .
i get all my clo@@ th@@ es from a second hand on air@@ port and in calcul@@ t-@@ hand@@ -@@ hand@@ -@@ hand@@ s .
o@@ oh , thank you very much .
calcul@@ ated hand sh@@ opp@@ ing allows me to reduce the impact of my qua@@ ke on the environment , and also on my own pur@@ pos@@ es .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars usually do for a good cause ; i see quite unique ; and it makes sh@@ opp@@ ing to my very personal clo@@ th@@ es .
and i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to have my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
is it going to cost less than 20 dollars ?
when i ask all the answers , i feel like i won .
so i come back to my su@@ it@@ case , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve pac@@ ked for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does anyone do with so many out@@ its with this ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve gotten with .
i brought up seven pieces of under@@ wear , and that &apos;s all .
under@@ gro@@ unds for just one week are all i &apos;ve done in my su@@ it@@ case .
i was fir@@ ming that i could be able to find anything i might wear , if i &apos;d come to pal@@ m spr@@ ings .
and since you didn &apos;t have heard of me as the woman who runs around here at ted in your under@@ wear -- that &apos;s what i &apos;ve found a couple of things .
and i &apos;m probably going to show you my out@@ f@@ its for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i believe , whether you don &apos;t learn it or not , from these ad@@ vent@@ ures , not to carry nothing new .
so let &apos;s start with sun@@ day .
i call this the gri@@ gh@@ ent tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look at great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars for less than 50 dollars .
this whole out@@ fit , including the jac@@ ket , took me 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive piece that i had car@@ ried in this whole week .
mon@@ day : paint is a little bit of powerful .
it &apos;s almost more physi@@ ologi@@ cally impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing light red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to pull other happy people .
tu@@ es@@ day : ada@@ pt is completely over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time of my life trying to be myself , and ada@@ pt me at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you surro@@ und yourself with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreci@@ ate it .
we@@ dn@@ es@@ day : embra@@ ce your inner child .
occasi@@ on@@ ally , people tell me , i &apos;d like to say , &quot; or i remember them at their se@@ ven@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds , or i remember them on their
and i &apos;d like s@@ mile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
don@@ ner@@ day : sel@@ ure is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good in something good , you definitely have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me this day for day .
but only when i was 30 years ago , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll sum@@ mar@@ ize this short for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and out and out of a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t carry .
so there &apos;s no exc@@ use for someone here in this crowd .
we should be able to ro@@ ck everything that we want .
thank you very much .
fri@@ day : a universal truth -- five words : golden pa@@ il@@ le@@ tes fit all the time .
and finally , satur@@ day : to develop a unique , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world a little bit about one word without saying a word .
it was pro@@ ven me over and over and over again , when there was people going up , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conver@@ sa@@ tions .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my very tiny su@@ it@@ case .
so before i go home to broo@@ kl@@ yn , i &apos;m going to don@@ ate this all again .
because the lesson that i myself leave myself with this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to do it emotion@@ ally , because right around the street , there will always be another crazy , color@@ ful , ri@@ cious , ri@@ cious , ri@@ cious out@@ fit , just waiting for me to wait a little bit of love in the heart and look at it .
thank you very much very much .
thank you very much .
good after@@ noon , all together .
so i &apos;ve got something i &apos;d like to show you .
think of this as a visual point , as flying as flying vision .
this is what we call in our lab , per@@ su@@ asi@@ ble design .
so let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m origin@@ ally itali@@ ans , and every boy in it@@ al@@ y grew up with this picture in it@@ al@@ y , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that in for@@ mul@@ a 1 , something very interesting in the past decade has happened something very interesting .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a for@@ mul@@ a 1 race , they took their budget , and they &apos;d put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the ri@@ vers were good enough , they won the race .
now today , you need , if you want to re@@ gain a race , in fact , something like this , something like this -- something about the car in real time , has a couple of thousands of sensor@@ s , the information from the car , allow this information out of the system , and then re@@ pair it and use them to send decisions in real time , and change things in real time as information is being colle@@ cted .
this is what you would call , in engineering , a re@@ al-@@ time controll@@ ing system .
and , in essen@@ ce , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made from two parts -- a moving part and a rec@@ ant .
what &apos;s interesting today is the re@@ al-@@ time control systems are starting to start in our lives .
our cities have been equi@@ pped , in the last few years , with mobile programs and electr@@ on@@ ics .
they &apos;re going to be in the free .
and as a computer , they start re@@ acting in a different way , and they start percei@@ ved and powered .
when we go to cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i &apos;d like to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lives there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- cause up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so , if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
out of the cities , pull up all of that experience and moving in the objects of everyday life .
this is from a exhi@@ bi@@ tion called pa@@ ol@@ a ant@@ on@@ ell@@ i for mom@@ a later a year , in the summer , in the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; i &apos;m going to be . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , starting to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if each at@@ om will be out there , a sen@@ sor and a driver &apos;s licen@@ se .
and this changes radi@@ cally the interaction that we humans have with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
you know , when mich@@ el@@ angel@@ o formed mo@@ ses , he says he took the ham@@ mer at the end and he thre@@ w it on mo@@ ses -- in fact , you can still see a little spot down -- and said , &quot; per@@ ch@@ é n@@ on par@@ l@@ i ? why don &apos;t you care ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins our first time to respond to answers .
i &apos;m just going to show you a couple of examples -- again , to embra@@ ce our environment and embra@@ ce the idea of our environment .
so let &apos;s start with the feeling of that .
so the first project i &apos;d like to show you is in fact one of the first of our lab@@ s .
it was developed two and a half years ago in it@@ al@@ y .
and what we &apos;ve done is , in fact , using a new kind of network that &apos;s been used all over the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and using anony@@ mous and ag@@ gre@@ dat@@ ated information from this network that are colle@@ cted to the oper@@ ator to understand how the city works .
the summer was a lucky summer -- in 2006 .
it was the foot@@ ball world c@@ up of the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship
some of you will remember it , it was playing as it@@ al@@ ing against fr@@ ance , and then at the end of zi@@ dan@@ e , the head@@ sha@@ ke .
and no matter it@@ al@@ y has won the end of it@@ al@@ y
now , look at what &apos;s happened on this day , only watching the activity of the activity that &apos;s happening in the network .
and here you see the city .
you can see in the middle of the col@@ o@@ s@@ se@@ um , the li@@ red ti@@ ver .
in the morning , in front of the game .
you &apos;re looking at the ti@@ mel@@ ine on the top .
before after@@ noon , people here and there , and there , the phone calls and they move .
and the game starts -- sil@@ ence .
fr@@ ance makes a tor . it@@ al@@ ing a tor makes a tor .
hal@@ f-@@ time , people make a short call , go on the toi@@ let .
second seas@@ on . end of the normal game time .
the first exten@@ sion , second .
zi@@ dan@@ e , in a moment of the head of the head .
it@@ air w@@ ins . yeah .
now , that night , everyone went to the center to celebra@@ te .
and they saw the great vel@@ el .
the next day , everyone went to the center to meet the coun@@ t@@ ary and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everyone went down .
you &apos;re looking at the image of the room , like co mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since the tube time , people go to celebra@@ te people -- to have a big party , and you &apos;ll see the inci@@ ct at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today in a way , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
again , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but it &apos;s about things that we use and consum@@ ing .
well today , we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps from which a ma@@ c computer is , how they came together .
but we just know just a little bit about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed a few little mark@@ ers to pur@@ sue the g@@ arb@@ age while he &apos;s going through the system .
so we started with some volunte@@ ers that have helped us , a little more than a year , in se@@ attle , to tag the things that they thre@@ w off -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that you would be going to throw away .
we then have the little chi@@ ps , the little br@@ ands , thre@@ aten on the g@@ arb@@ age , and we started tracking it .
so here are the results that we just got .
from se@@ attle ...
after just a week .
with this information , we realized that there are a lot of in@@ struc@@ tions in the system .
and we can actually do the same things with a less energy .
it wasn &apos;t available before the data before .
but this is happening a lot of inse@@ ctive and complicated things .
the other thing is that we believe that when we see every day , that the c@@ art we throw away , not just disappe@@ aring away , that it &apos;s still on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re still thro@@ wing away every day away .
and if we were to show that to the people , then we can drive a behavior change .
and so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
so my collea@@ gue at mit , as@@ sa@@ f bi@@ der@@ man , could give you a lot more about vision , and the many other magni@@ fi@@ cent things you can do with , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we discus@@ sed , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we discus@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s the accu@@ ra@@ cy of our environment .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in the clin@@ a@@ go@@ za a few years ago , spa@@ in
it started with a question of the may@@ master who came to us and said that spa@@ in and south europe have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of architecture as part of architecture .
and the question was , how could technology rel@@ ate to technology , new technology with this ?
and one of the ideas that have been colle@@ cted in a pair of work is , imagine these tu@@ bes , and val@@ ves , magnetic val@@ ves , val@@ ves that open up and close .
they &apos;re doing something like a water@@ ten@@ sion of water dete@@ ction from water .
if these pieces are fall@@ ing down , you can write it , you can write patterns , images , text , text ads .
and you can approach him , and he &apos;s going to open up , and he &apos;s going to open up , just as you can see in this picture .
well , we introduced the ma@@ yo@@ r of bel@@ hole .
it &apos;s very like him .
and we got the mission to design a building at the ent@@ r@@ ance of exp@@ o .
and we called it the digital water pa@@ ir@@ li@@ on .
the whole building was made out of water .
there &apos;s no do@@ ors or windows , but if you &apos;re approach@@ ing it , it will open up and you go in .
the cei@@ ling was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s wh@@ and@@ ly , if you want to reduce the inje@@ ction , you can even leave the roof down the roof .
or you could conclu@@ de the building , and the whole architecture is going to open up the whole architecture , like in this case , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destro@@ yed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destro@@ y the building , it &apos;s just the fact that architecture is almost disappe@@ aring .
so , here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s asked what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you see me , when i was trying to test sensor@@ s that open the water , not to become we@@ t .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all of the sensor@@ s were going to happen .
but in fact , it was even more fun that night .
all the kids from on@@ a@@ go@@ za came up to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to you , but a building that still had brea@@ ks and holes in the water , you had to jump without being we@@ ak@@ ed .
and it was , for us , very exciting , because as architec@@ ts , engineers , as designers , we think we &apos;re always thinking about how the people who are designing things that we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always un@@ predic@@ table .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical visu@@ als , the ima@@ gery from water and the proje@@ ction on it .
and this is what led us to think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
so imagine this foot@@ actual scen@@ es could really begin to fly .
imagine you could have little heli@@ cop@@ ters that fly through the air , and each one of you with a little piece of the light with a little bit of light -- just like a cloud that can move through the space .
so here &apos;s the video .
imagine a heli@@ cop@@ ter , like the one you saw before , which is moving with others , completely syn@@ chr@@ ony .
you can have these clou@@ k .
you can have a kind of flexi@@ ble screen or display display , like this -- a compar@@ able forma@@ tion in two dimensions .
or in@@ frequ@@ ently , in three dimensions , where what change is , the light is not the position , not the position of the video points .
they can play with different types of different ways .
imagine the screen just in different forma@@ ts or si@@ zes , in different resol@@ ves , in different in@@ stances of em@@ power@@ ments .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud of sculp@@ tural points that you can walk on , and through which they can look through them , which you can look up with many , many direc@@ tions .
what you &apos;re looking at here is a real fl@@ y@@ lic controll@@ ing controll@@ ing that goes down to form a compar@@ able spor@@ ts .
if you turn in the light , it looks like this , so the same way we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of the people is being controlled .
it may have every single foot@@ age of a pul@@ se that comes from people , from the mov@@ ements of people , or anything .
i want to show you a little bit of the first thing here .
we &apos;ve worked with ro@@ ber@@ to bol@@ le , one of the best bal@@ let dan@@ cers of our time -- the é@@ lau@@ le at me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan theater in new york and sc@@ ala in ma@@ il@@ and -- we &apos;ve made his mov@@ ements in 3d to use them as moment@@ um for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
and here you see ro@@ ber@@ to dan@@ cing .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you can see the sculp@@ tures , the different ac@@ tors .
it &apos;s simul@@ tane@@ ously a re@@ al-@@ time 3d scan , and it &apos;s a movement shot .
that &apos;s how you can ada@@ pt the whole movement .
and you can do this all the time .
but then , once we have all the recor@@ ds , they can play with it and play with paint , gravity and brea@@ thing .
that &apos;s what we like to use as a potential impul@@ se for the fl@@ y@@ fire .
i &apos;d like to show you the lat@@ est project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olymp@@ ics in london &apos;s day .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- it &apos;s called the cloud .
so the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re starting to engage the people to do something and change the environment -- almost something like what we call the cloud motion , how to move a bar@@ ger@@ or , but with a cloud .
imagine everyone else can give a little don@@ ation for a stand@@ point .
i think that the remarkable age of events last years , the last decade is that we &apos;ve moved from a physical world to a digital world .
it has di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed everything , knowledge , and it makes it acc@@ essi@@ ble by the internet .
no@@ wa@@ days , for the first time , we can do this -- and the campaign mis@@ str@@ as showed this -- we can take from the digital world , from which self-@@ organi@@ zing forces of networks to the physical world .
this can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
it means something which is built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can take us the next challenges -- think about climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world towards the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually invol@@ ve the people in which they put things together , colle@@ c@@ tively .
the cloud is again a cloud of dete@@ ction points , the same way as a real cloud is a cloud of a cloud .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of dete@@ ction , as our cloud is a
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it &apos;s covered with sculp@@ ting points .
they can move in and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them from the bottom , the most important moments for the olymp@@ ics of 20@@ 12 and view , and it &apos;s used as a way of conne@@ cting the community .
so both of us , the laws of physics in the sky and something you can do about the top , like london &apos;s new mountain sum@@ mit .
you can go in .
and sort of a digital ligh@@ t@@ asy in the night -- but as the most important , a new kind of experience , for all who want to go to the top .
thank you very much .
as a perfor@@ mer , it &apos;s very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to suggest that people are separ@@ ated by nature , and it &apos;s all connected to each other .
the first time i was almost 10 years ago in northern ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , where i saw my first ic@@ e@@ berg .
i &apos;m going to get rid of eff@@ or@@ t@@ ary .
my heart ra@@ ils , i was sc@@ ar@@ m@@ ful , while i was trying to cover what i was standing in front of
the ice mountains around me swi@@ t@@ ched around to the water , and i was able to just wonder that this was a s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke on another s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke , a year after year .
ic@@ et@@ els are born as a cal@@ f of a gl@@ aci@@ er , or by breaking out of ice she@@ ets .
each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
and they interact in clear ways with their surro@@ und@@ ings and their experiences .
some people fall up and gra@@ b up to the bit@@ ter end , while others don &apos;t stand up and down in an in@@ sur@@ ity of dra@@ matic passion .
if you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , you find easier that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , separ@@ ated and alone , just the way we tell us humans often .
but the truth is far away from it .
while there &apos;s a ic@@ e@@ berg , i brea@@ th@@ es its temporary atmosphere .
during the ic@@ e@@ berg , it pul@@ ls miner@@ al drin@@ king drin@@ king water that contribu@@ tes to a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m looking at my foot@@ age of this ic@@ e@@ berg as if i &apos;m going to do portra@@ its of my ancestors , in terms of consciousness , that you can look at these individu@@ ally individual moments from this way , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death when it &apos;s breaking up ; it &apos;s not a very end , but it &apos;s a continu@@ ation of your path along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ lands in the ic@@ e@@ lands that i &apos;ve done is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and one part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
i &apos;d like to show you the last pictures that i &apos;d like to show you , a ic@@ e@@ berg , which i &apos;ve been doing in c@@ lar@@ t@@ su@@ at@@ si@@ ak in green@@ land .
very r@@ ar@@ ely , you &apos;re actually going to wit@@ ness a roll@@ ing ic@@ e@@ berg .
so here &apos;s what it is .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
so , please watch the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg , and where it &apos;s on the water line .
you can see here , he &apos;s starting to roll , and the boat moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a size ic@@ e@@ berg .
it &apos;s about 120 feet out of the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you another side of its person@@ ality .
thank you very much .
my life is truly bl@@ essed by the work of the work in some amazing projects .
but the cool@@ est thing that i ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is quie@@ t .
st@@ j was one of the leading gra@@ ff@@ iti artist in the 198@@ 0s .
and then one day , he came back from running , and he said , &quot; pa@@ ps , my legs cr@@ as@@ hed . &quot;
and that was the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of that as well .
now there &apos;s completely paraly@@ zed to this today .
he can only use his eyes yet .
i was in charge of him .
i &apos;ve got a company that makes design and anima@@ tions , and gra@@ ff@@ iti is inevi@@ t@@ ably a more complex part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re in the art world and listen to .
so we decided , tony -- fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed -- fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed -- and suppor@@ ting his thing .
and i met with his dad and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to go back with him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw ste@@ phen haw@@ king -- can &apos;t all the paraly@@ zed people be able to communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard to the higher form of life and you have some remarkable in@@ sur@@ ance , you can actually do that .
ordinary people are not acc@@ essi@@ ble to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how are you communic@@ ating now ? &quot;
anyone ever saw the movie bu@@ tter@@ fly and sub@@ sen@@ si@@ ble glass ?
that &apos;s how you communicate -- this is how your fing@@ ers go along .
and i was like , &quot; very arch@@ a@@ ian , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just put up a check , and instead i made a check that i didn &apos;t have the most the most sli@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed idea of how to fix it .
and i was commit@@ ted to the place and i was standing on his brother and his father -- telling the words , &quot; well , my sugge@@ sti@@ on is saying , tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;re going to inv@@ ent him a machine , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art again .
because it &apos;s a far@@ ce that someone who does in your own , cannot be able to communicate it . &quot;
so i spoke to a few months later at a conference .
i met these guys from the gr@@ l , gra@@ ff@@ iti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then draw with a las@@ er poin@@ ter that regi@@ ster@@ es only the negative space .
so they &apos;re looking around and doing art instal@@ lations like this .
they &apos;re saying that all the things that are being shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the heal@@ thi@@ ers , and then they arri@@ ve , and then the bush words , and they actually make art in art .
but there was always another cycle of life in their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
so i went home and i went to dinner with my wife , and she told her all of us , and we thought , &quot; well , a second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use with your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that there can be a las@@ er , so that he can do gra@@ ff@@ iti again , that would be great . &quot;
so that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot later , and lots of things and a lot of things , we &apos;ve achie@@ ved some things .
first of all , we put the sur@@ sur@@ ance to the do@@ ors , and we actually got a device that he can communicate with a device that he can communicate with -- a ste@@ phen haw@@ king machine .
that was un@@ belie@@ vable .
and he &apos;s really incredibly funny -- i call him yo@@ da , because you &apos;re talking to him , or give an email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so mis@@ er@@ able , this guy is incredible . &quot;
plus , we &apos;ve flo@@ wn seven progra@@ mm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally from all of the world &apos;s tops of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i moved to the garage , and these ha@@ ck@@ ers and progra@@ mm@@ ers and con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cies and con@@ form@@ u@@ tic@@ als have taken up our house .
a lot of our friends thought that we were really du@@ m@@ b to do that , and we &apos;d come back and we &apos;d go back and all the images on the walls would be sc@@ aring gra@@ ff@@ ics .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been progra@@ mm@@ ed , we went to the beach record in ven@@ ice , my children have been em@@ bed@@ ded , my dog , and we &apos;ve created this .
it &apos;s called e@@ ye@@ ingu@@ a , and you can see the descri@@ ption of the descri@@ ption .
this is a cheap sun@@ glas@@ h that we pur@@ ch@@ ased on the beach record of ven@@ ice , a little cop@@ per wire , and some things from the building market and the electr@@ on@@ ics trade .
so we took a p@@ s@@ 3 camera , we built it , they put it on a light , and now we &apos;ve got a device available to free -- you can build it yourself , we can build it , we put the code free , the software can be able to down@@ load free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free from limit@@ ations .
no in@@ sur@@ ance can be ir@@ on@@ able .
it &apos;s not a hospital .
each paraly@@ zed can actually communicate with his eyes alone , or draw .
thank you very much .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back in the very flas@@ h room .
and i love this image , because it &apos;s the room of someone else , and that &apos;s his room .
now there &apos;s all of these ru@@ m@@ ble before the great un@@ en@@ vel@@ op@@ e .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of progra@@ mming labor , micro@@ -@@ par@@ li@@ ty and oper@@ ated brea@@ ks , tony was scri@@ red for the first time in seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking beyond his life support system .
we attra@@ cted his bed so that he can see it outside .
we set up a proje@@ ctor against a wall of the par@@ king ar@@ ray from the hospital .
and he dre@@ w back for the first time , in his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was in the par@@ king lot .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , we had to break up in the par@@ king lot , so we felt ourselves as a part of the emergen@@ ce scene .
at the end of the end , he came up with an email with the content : &quot; for the first time in seven years , i dre@@ w a little bit .
and i feel like i was gl@@ or@@ ed under@@ water , and i finally picked up and pulled my head up and pulled my head up so i can brea@@ the . &quot;
isn &apos;t that over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming ?
it &apos;s something like our fight wrong .
and that kee@@ ps us at the bottom , and we continue to evol@@ ve and continue to
and we need to do a lot more about this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but there &apos;s a magic ca@@ p of magic .
and someone who has such an arti@@ stic potential , deser@@ ves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stron@@ ger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all sorts of sele@@ ction .
we &apos;ve won a couple of pri@@ ces .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deser@@ ve in it .
it all comes out of our own po@@ ckets .
so the ex@@ pos@@ ure were like , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
arm@@ strong lau@@ f@@ ated us over us , and then in dec@@ ember , in dec@@ ember , the ti@@ me@@ -@@ magazine pres@@ ented us as one of the 50 best invention of 2010 , which was really very great .
and the cool@@ est thing is -- and this inclu@@ des all the circle -- that there &apos;s apri@@ l , in the down@@ town of los angeles at the down@@ town of los angeles , is going to be a pres@@ entation called &quot; some of the streets &quot; as the streets . &quot;
and there may be pretty much the har@@ dest repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives of the street &apos;s art scene -- bank@@ sy , she@@ par@@ d fa@@ i@@ re@@ y , ca@@ ws -- all these guys will be there .
so there &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is quite dis@@ gu@@ sting .
and so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , that &apos;s impossible , then it makes possible possible .
and everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this micro@@ phone , the e@@ ye@@ ler -- everything was impossible at some point .
do it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a program@@ mer , and i had never had anything to do with a super@@ source technology , but i just got around and surro@@ und me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and that question should each of you , should any one of you and every day that you feel something that needs to be done , if not now , when not now ? and if not i , who ? and if not i , who ?
thank you very much .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most well-@@ bor@@ ented children &apos;s boo@@ k@@ writer .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get to how a scientist wants to come .
you can have me as a farmer , or in lea@@ ther , but no one has ever cho@@ sen farmers .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you about cir@@ cles and re@@ vel@@ ations .
well , one thing is , it &apos;s usually something that you find because you &apos;re going to drop it anywhere .
you go around the block , and it &apos;s what it looks like as a re@@ vel@@ ation
this is a pain@@ t@@ asy of a circle .
and one of my friends made it -- richard b@@ oll@@ ing@@ hi@@ pers .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated place i &apos;d like to tell you about today .
my circle started in the &apos; 6@@ 0s at high school in sto@@ w , o@@ hi@@ o , where i was the nur@@ k .
i was the guy who had been be@@ aten up every week in the virg@@ ent@@ i le@@ per@@ age every week , until a teacher saved my life .
they saved my life by taking me the toi@@ let in the teacher &apos;s room .
that &apos;s what she was doing .
it did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a th@@ um@@ b , and i had 85 dollars , and it hit me to san francisco in california -- i found a lo@@ ver -- and then in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i found it in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , i found it in the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of the night , sig@@ ns , who said , &quot; i &apos;ve got to see you .
i &apos;m very sad that we never have learned each other as adults .
you can go to o@@ hi@@ o , and please come along with the man i know you &apos;ve found it in the world .
and i should mention that i have a plan@@ tur@@ al cancer , and i want you to go to hell . &quot;
well , the next day , we were in cle@@ vel@@ and .
we looked at them , we laugh@@ ed , we were cr@@ ying , and we knew that they had to be in a ho@@ spi@@ ce .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we got them around them , and we gave them eight , and we gave them eight , because it was needed .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , she turned to me , turned them into a box full of a box , and i was placed in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it became a circle -- and the re@@ vel@@ ation that i talked about was there .
the re@@ vel@@ ation is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i re@@ f@@ used to teach her .
and , you know , this part of life needs everything that is needed the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so gla@@ d that this has been mentioned here today , so often here .
he needs the same thing -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you very much .
imagine a large explosion , as you go up to 1,000 meters .
imagine a plane in a very smo@@ ke .
imagine a driver , the cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , bla@@ ke .
that sounds fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
now , i had a unique place on that day ; i was sitting on 1@@ d .
i was the only one who was able to talk with flight flight .
so i looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;d have caught a couple of birds . &quot;
the pilot had already looked at the machine , and we didn &apos;t have that far away .
you were able to see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things were working at the same time .
the pilot provi@@ ded the machine at the hu@@ d@@ son river .
that &apos;s usually not the rou@@ te .
he swi@@ t@@ ches the dri@@ ve engine .
just think of a sound plane .
and then he said three words -- the coura@@ ge@@ ous words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; en@@ ab@@ ling to wra@@ p up . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the bri@@ d@@ gles anymore .
i could see it in your eyes , there was sh@@ ells , the life was to end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned that day about me .
i learned that , in a moment , everything else is different .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we wanted to do in life , and i thought about all the people that i wanted to make a hand and didn &apos;t do it all the f@@ ences that i wanted to do , all the experiences that i wanted to do and never made .
and while i was thinking about it later , a phr@@ ase occur@@ red to me , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is so far , and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to change a little bit more in life .
and that ur@@ gen@@ cy , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about that day -- and this was when we were missing the george washington bridge , pretty much about hair -- and i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i really sel@@ ec@@ ted .
and i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my fau@@ lt , i en@@ counter@@ ed myself to become better immer@@ sion in everything i was pac@@ king .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my e@@ go room .
and i strug@@ gl@@ ed the time i &apos;m wa@@ sting for meaning@@ less things , with people who mean something .
and i was thinking about the relationship with my wife , with friends , to people .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to inv@@ ade negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
i had no more repor@@ ted for my wife two years .
it feels great at all .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i need to be happy for being happy .
the third thing that i learned about -- and this is what the inner clock started , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , &quot; -- down .
you can see the water coming .
and i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to break this thing up in 20 pieces , as you know it from docum@@ ent@@ ies .
while we dro@@ pped , i had this feeling , man , not dying is not fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
almost as if we were prepar@@ ing our lives , we were prepar@@ ing .
but it was a very sad thing .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sa@@ dness really formed in one thought , which is that i just enjo@@ yed one of those things .
i just wish that i could grow up my kids .
about a month after i vis@@ ited a month after my daughter -- first gra@@ ders , not a lot of arti@@ stic talent ...
... it &apos;s not yet .
and i &apos;m going to celebra@@ te , i &apos;m like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
and i realized that at the time , by looking at the dots with each other , that it &apos;s just a great father in life .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life , being a good father .
i became the mira@@ cle of the mira@@ cle that day wasn &apos;t going to die .
i got another gift , which is to look into the future and come back and to live and live differently .
my call to everyone who &apos;s flying today is : imagine , the same thing on your flight -- don &apos;t you -- but imagine , and how would you change it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that they were going up , because they think they were there forever forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are you the best parents that they can only be ?
thank you very much .
the idea behind the slo@@ x@@ net &apos;s computer wor@@ m is quite stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward .
we don &apos;t want the bom@@ b to build the bom@@ b .
the most important sig@@ ns there for the development of nuclear weapons is the ancient in@@ centi@@ vi@@ zation facili@@ ty in the boo@@ ges .
the gra@@ y bo@@ x@@ es that you see here , these are re@@ al-@@ time controlled systems .
now , if we are able to com@@ bine the systems , which are what dri@@ ves and val@@ ves control , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
these gra@@ y bo@@ xes don &apos;t run with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can manage that a powerful win@@ l virus is being used on a laptop that &apos;s used by a war@@ ning engineer to con@@ fir@@ m these gra@@ y box , then we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning behind slo@@ x@@ net .
so we start with a win@@ dow@@ y fi@@ pp@@ er .
the use data is trans@@ fer@@ red into the gra@@ y box , dama@@ ges the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , and the ir@@ ani@@ an nuclear progra@@ mming program is rele@@ asing -- mission ex@@ ecu@@ ted .
this is a child game , isn &apos;t it ?
so i want to tell you how we found this .
when we started tour@@ ing our research , six months ago was completely un@@ known , which was the purpose and purpose of that concept .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the win@@ k part , the cont@@ all@@ s part , it was made by coun@@ t@@ less scre@@ ening s@@ hr@@ in@@ ks .
and it seemed to have something like this , with these gra@@ y bo@@ xes , this re@@ al-@@ time control system .
so we got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infe@@ cted our environment with stu@@ x@@ net , and we studied this constru@@ ct .
and then something funny happened happened .
st@@ x@@ net had fallen like a labor@@ s that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- swe@@ et , but they didn &apos;t want to eat it .
and that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after having experim@@ ented with various types of che@@ ese , i came out that this is a very significant attack .
fully to a particular goal .
the fi@@ p@@ ger@@ er is activ@@ ated on the gra@@ y box when a special con@@ figu@@ ration has been discovered , even if the special program , which makes it in@@ her@@ ently trying to happen on that target .
and if it &apos;s not , it doesn &apos;t do pen@@ x@@ net .
so , this is really my interest , and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it might be , for example , a u.s. , american power station , or a chemical facili@@ ty in germany .
so , we should just figure out what the target is .
so we extra@@ cted and re@@ com@@ men@@ ded the commercial code , and we found that it &apos;s hard@@ -@@ struc@@ tured in two digital war@@ heads -- smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that they were very profession@@ ally designed by people who obviously had access to the information .
they knew all the bits and sou@@ ges that they had to attack .
probably they even knew the sho@@ ot@@ ing size of the machine admini@@ stration .
so , they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve had to get involved that the dr@@ ank of slo@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s a lot more sophisti@@ cated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a piece of this attack from this attack .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned building language language .
and i &apos;d like to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so , what we &apos;re first looking at was system process@@ ing , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
and then we se@@ arch@@ ed for ti@@ les and data and trying to connect this with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theor@@ ies about these goals that we could demon@@ strate or con@@ stra@@ int .
in order to make these theor@@ ies , we re@@ com@@ men@@ d that it &apos;s definitely about high-@@ quality s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it has to be a high-@@ quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because there &apos;s been repor@@ ted most infe@@ ction .
now , in this region , there &apos;s not a couple thousand tar@@ gets in this area .
it &apos;s basically running out of the bu@@ mp@@ bone nuclear force , and it &apos;s on the ur@@ ani@@ um in@@ struc@@ tive plant in the viet@@ tr@@ ance .
so i said to my assi@@ stant , &quot; let me take me a list of all the experts for cent@@ ri@@ ties and power plants from our cli@@ el@@ y . &quot;
and i called them up and doing her knowledge to compare their knowledge with what we found in the code and in the data .
and it worked very well .
so , it was possible to connect the little digital toi@@ let with the ro@@ yp@@ tor@@ ation controll@@ ing .
the ro@@ tor is this moving part inside of the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge , this black object that you see .
and if you mani@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze the speed of this ro@@ zza , then you &apos;re actually able to cra@@ ck the ro@@ tor , and eventually you can explo@@ it the cen@@ ter@@ fu@@ r , and then even to rele@@ ase the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ge .
and what we &apos;ve discovered is that the goal of the attack is to actually make it happen and not happen to it , and that &apos;s why war@@ ning engineers are des@@ per@@ ating , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get it behind .
the great digital war@@ let -- we made a gli@@ mp@@ se by looking very carefully by looking at data and data .
so , for instance , in terms of 16@@ 4 , there &apos;s a lot of this code , and you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started working with scientific liter@@ ature about how these cent@@ ri@@ ties are built in nat@@ ec@@ tis@@ es , and they found that they were struc@@ tured in what they call cas@@ u@@ ca@@ des , and each of the cas@@ ds con@@ tain 16@@ 4 cent@@ ri@@ ties .
so , it made sense , it was fit together .
and it became better than that .
these cent@@ ri@@ ties in iran have been divi@@ ded in 15 so-@@ called the distance .
and do you understand what we found in the commercial code ?
it &apos;s an almost iden@@ tical structure .
so again , it &apos;s really good together .
and that gave us a lot of confidence for what we were discus@@ sing here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , it didn &apos;t just go like that .
these results have been achie@@ ved by a couple of weeks of hard work .
and often we just ran into a stop@@ ward , and we had to collect us new .
anyway , what we found was that both digital spr@@ ops are actually going on in reality and the same target , but from various direc@@ tions .
the little lea@@ f takes off a cas@@ k , and the ro@@ tor turns off and slo@@ wing the ro@@ tor and slo@@ wing it down , and the big lea@@ f &apos;s head is going on with six pur@@ ch@@ ases in inter@@ actions and mani@@ pul@@ ates val@@ ves .
so , we &apos;re very confi@@ dent , and we &apos;re very confi@@ dent that we actually have determin@@ ed what the target is .
it &apos;s nat@@ ance , and it &apos;s just nat@@ ec@@ ty .
so we don &apos;t have to worry about that other goals would be made by slo@@ x@@ ors .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- made me tun@@ e out of the so@@ cks .
down there , there &apos;s the gra@@ y box , and on the top , you see the cent@@ ri@@ ver box .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s spre@@ ads the levels of sensor@@ s -- such as pressure sensor@@ s and vi@@ bra@@ tional sensor@@ s -- and there &apos;s legi@@ ti@@ mi@@ zing code to contribu@@ tion@@ ing , which is still wrong during the attack with fal@@ se data , running .
and in fact , this fal@@ se data of slo@@ x@@ net has already recor@@ ded before .
so it &apos;s just the same way in hollywood movies , where it &apos;s being f@@ ed the monit@@ or@@ ing camera with previ@@ ously recor@@ ded video recor@@ ds .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
and the idea of this is obviously not just the machine oper@@ ator in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s even much more dangerous and more ag@@ gressi@@ ve .
the idea is to re@@ je@@ ct a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine oper@@ ator can &apos;t respond fast enough to respond .
so in a power station , for example , if the big ste@@ am tur@@ bine becomes too quick , you have to open up the val@@ ri@@ can@@ es within a milli@@ seconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine gui@@ de .
so , at this point , we need digital security systems .
and if the thre@@ a@@ sts are , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explo@@ de .
and it &apos;s not the machine leaders , nor the security system , will notice it .
this is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
but it gets worse , even worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important about now .
think about it . that attack is gener@@ ic .
he has nothing to do with cent@@ ri@@ ven@@ ess , with an@@ an@@ an@@ ity .
so , for example , he would be working as well -- in a power station , or in a car factory .
it &apos;s gener@@ ic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attack -- you don &apos;t have to get the use of the data on a us@@ b stick , as we saw it at stu@@ x@@ net .
you could be able to spread ordinary wor@@ m@@ - technology .
you have to spread it just as much as possible .
and if you do that , you end up with a cy@@ -@@ wea@@ pon of a wea@@ pon of mass destruction
that &apos;s the con@@ sequence that we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not the middle east of these attac@@ ks .
they &apos;re lying in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the tar@@ t@@ est environments .
we have to ask the consequences , and we &apos;re going to start doing better care of ourselves .
thank you very much .
i &apos;ve got a question .
r@@ al@@ ph , and it &apos;s been repor@@ ted a lot of it , that people assu@@ me that the mo@@ s@@ gers is the main organization behind it .
is that your opini@@ on too ?
okay , so you really want to know that ?
yeah . all right .
in my view , the mo@@ th@@ wor@@ gers are involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the heart , super@@ power .
there &apos;s only one , and these are the united states -- for lu@@ ck@@ ily , for lu@@ ck .
because , otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thank you so much for giving us a san@@ ity . thank you r@@ al@@ ph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years to place myself in situations , which generally are very difficult , and at the same time .
i went to ja@@ il -- difficult .
i worked in a co@@ al-@@ min@@ min@@ o work -- dangerous .
i fil@@ med in war fields -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat anything more than this -- happy at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , the most part of my career , i &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to the very awful situations , and it &apos;s all about trying to study so@@ cially , to study so@@ cially , and are interesting , and hopefully , in a way that makes them happ@@ ily and acc@@ essi@@ ble in a way that makes them happ@@ ily and acc@@ essi@@ ble to the audience .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of mountain and spon@@ sor , i knew that i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard that i fli@@ pped up an ad a couple of weeks ago on e@@ bay a few weeks ago .
i sent a couple of facebook mes@@ sages , some twitter mes@@ sages , and i gave people the chance to stand the name rights at my ted@@ talk in 2011 .
in fact , a lot of happy people and companies , for@@ -@@ profit and non-@@ prof@@ its , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris ander@@ son will never leave that -- to buy the name rights at the talk that you &apos;re looking at , at the time , not a lot of content , and not a lot of hin@@ ts to what the top@@ ic would be .
and so what you &apos;ve got is this : your name here is , your ted@@ talk , that you have no idea what the subject is going to be , and who &apos;s ever been able to fly them for gran@@ ted , especially if i stand your company for your participa@@ tion , i think , especially if i stand up the company for your participa@@ tion
but , apart of that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know , how many people look at this ted@@ talks ?
a lot of a lot .
that &apos;s just the work of labor .
and so even though that war@@ ning , i knew that anyone would buy the name of the bill .
now , if you asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to say to you that with certain@@ ty .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we &apos;re explor@@ ing the world of marketing , the commer@@ ci@@ als .
now , as i said , i &apos;ve come through some pretty awful situations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ p@@ are me , nothing could seem to me , nothing so hard to go to a space and so dangerous as with these guys to go into a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i &apos;d like to do is a film around fin@@ e-@@ scale , marketing and commer@@ ci@@ als , and the whole film is fund@@ ed by ra@@ ge-@@ scale , marketing and commer@@ ci@@ als .
and the film is going to be the doctor &apos;s doctor . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the physi@@ cian &apos;s physi@@ cian &quot; is that everything , from above , from top , from the beginning to the end , is missing with bu@@ gs -- from the ti@@ tle spon@@ sor that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , this is the brand x .
now , this brand , the qu@@ al@@ com@@ m sta@@ dium , the sta@@ int center ...
these guys will be connected to the movie in your dest@@ ination -- forever .
and so the movie is going to be looking at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in fact , what ? in my infin@@ ity , forever ?
i &apos;m a red@@ mil@@ ing person .
that was more to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze .
it was &quot; in da@@ y@@ ness forever forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand of the brand as a ti@@ cket , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible categ@@ ory in the movie .
so we may sell a sho@@ e , and it &apos;s going to be the greatest sho@@ e that you &apos;ve ever wor@@ ed ...
the greatest car you ever met , from &quot; the chri@@ stian ones , &quot; the greatest drink , the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , is a remin@@ der of &quot; the chri@@ stian ones . &quot;
so the idea is , bes@@ i@@ des that br@@ ands are part of life , actually , to get them to fin@@ ance the film ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transpar@@ ency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of the stat@@ s .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning , beginning to end .
and i &apos;d love to be happy if ce@@ g was going to be able to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ulti@@ mate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how powerful people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use the point of view , because it has a negative con@@ not@@ ation -- but you know how that &apos;s going to be going to be going to be going to happen ?
how much money is requi@@ red to realize that ?
one and a half million .
i think it will be hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth proje@@ cting some really familiar mark@@ ers .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might see a hor@@ de of vol@@ li@@ on &apos;s vol@@ di@@ ots .
so what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is going to be very likely to be more likely .
but is it a difficult thing about the movie , or a difficult thing for me ?
j@@ k : both of us .
so , it doesn &apos;t mean that optimi@@ stic means .
so , my l@@ ord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help it .
all right .
fab@@ ul@@ ous .
we need to think of what the cra@@ cks .
yeah , yes .
when you look at the people that you have to do with ...
and there are some places that we can turn on .
just put the camera .
and i thought , &quot; just imagine the camera , &quot; would mean that we wanted to take a background interview .
it turns out it was really meant , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do it with your film . &quot;
and it just disappe@@ ared all of these companies , one after the other companies .
i don &apos;t want to do something about the movie .
and i was ast@@ on@@ ished .
they didn &apos;t want to do absolutely anything with the project .
and i was conf@@ used , because i was thinking , the whole concept , the idea of commer@@ lt , to present your product as many people as possible , so many people seem to be able to see it .
especially in the world today , in this inter@@ section of new and ancient media and the frag@@ mented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new exciting repres@@ ent@@ ative instrument , that the mas@@ ses brings this message .
no , that &apos;s what i thought i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a f@@ at@@ al er@@ ror , and that was the following thing .
in fact , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is is a problem is a problem .
you see , when you give a transpar@@ ency in google &apos;s search , this is one of the first pictures , it seems .
i really like your species , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . now .
that was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- fre@@ ely , to dete@@ ct and look and look around and look through and look through , and it &apos;s immediately understanding ; person@@ ality from vision and access to information , especially what &apos;s going to be the biggest problem . the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re hearing a whole bunch about transpar@@ ency right now .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ce@@ os say it .
but when it comes right now , it &apos;s meant to change something changes .
but why ? well transpar@@ ency is fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing -- like this magni@@ fi@@ cent bear , which is still brea@@ thing .
it &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this strange land street .
and it &apos;s very ris@@ ky , too .
what else would be ris@@ ky ?
all of a cru@@ f really cool club .
so this is very ris@@ ky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see when i was a kid , and my father got me with the lie -- and there he is sitting , and he looked at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three ver@@ sions of ver@@ sions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version of it . &quot;
so , what you &apos;re looking at with this film is we wanted to tell the real version .
but there was only one company , an agen@@ cy was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s because i knew john bon@@ d and richard kir@@ sh@@ en@@ hit@@ ds for years -- i realized i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the middle of the middle , and i had to go right with my team to go
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to be a significant problem , is a problem .
i have friends who do big , gigan@@ tic hollywood films , and i have friends who are doing little arti@@ tic@@ als as i do .
and my friends , the great , gigan@@ tic hollywood movies , say that the reason their films are so successful about the mars part@@ ners that they have .
and then my friends who make little artists films , &quot; well , how are we going to compe@@ te with these big , gigan@@ tic hollywood film@@ graph@@ s ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the chri@@ stian physi@@ cian . &quot;
so , how exactly are we going to see ver@@ in in the movie ?
every time i take on the path , and whenever i open up the medical s@@ ank , you &apos;ll see an extra@@ de@@ cu@@ edi@@ ty .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you going to be fresh enough for that interview ?
are you right now ? you &apos;re looking a little nervous .
i want to help you to cal@@ m .
so maybe you should get a little bit of this in front of the interview . &quot;
and then we give one of these magni@@ fi@@ cent ch@@ un@@ ks .
either &quot; fl@@ bi fusion , &quot; or a par@@ ad@@ ise win@@ ds , you &apos;ll have the ele@@ ction .
we &apos;re being equi@@ pped both for men and for women -- we &apos;re stuck , roll@@ -@@ on , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the shor@@ eline .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you an exc@@ ell@@ ent argument .
we &apos;re a little smaller brand .
and as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re an app@@ lic@@ ator as a brand .
so , we don &apos;t have a budget like other po@@ ps .
so , doing these things -- you know , remem@@ bers people from ban -- that &apos;s sort of why we &apos;re interested in .
who &apos;s the words that you would be able to describe ?
ban is the blan@@ k .
that &apos;s a great question .
it was re@@ war@@ ding technology .
technology is not the way that you should describe something that someone does in the slide .
we &apos;re talking about sh@@ ine , fresh .
i think , &quot; fres@@ h &quot; is a great word that this categ@@ ory really becomes a positive power , unlike &quot; re@@ lie@@ vation smell and mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure . &quot;
it wei@@ gh@@ s you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , more fresh , three times in@@ centi@@ ve .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a milli@@ on-@@ dollar corpo@@ ration .
what about me ? what about the prin@@ t@@ ning bubble ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , who are like me , ot@@ to &apos;s sex consum@@ ers .
you need to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
h@@ mm@@ m , my brand ?
&quot; i don &apos;t know .
i like to really like beautiful clo@@ th@@ es .
8@@ 0s re@@ vi@@ val hit sc@@ at@@ ter butt@@ on , except on the wake day .
all right , so what &apos;s the mountain ger@@ ry ?
unique one .
i think the gen@@ re , the style i &apos;ve got , is probably &quot; the local glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of glass sounds and stuff like that .
but normally , i &apos;ve got an ac@@ cess@@ or bu@@ cket , like sun@@ glas@@ ses , or a je@@ wel@@ ry and such a stuff .
if dan was a brand , he would be probably a classi@@ c mer@@ ce@@ des of the c@@ lar@@ a .
the one thing that i am is the one i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to say ris@@ thi@@ ous fly .
woman # 2 : part hi@@ pp@@ ie , part of yo@@ g@@ i , part@@ in broo@@ kl@@ y@@ n-@@ girls -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the ch@@ ie@@ f guy .
i sell block@@ prin@@ ts all over the country , around the world .
so , i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , di@@ stor@@ ted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fe@@ de@@ x , because i was cr@@ as@@ hing .
man 5 : artic@@ el@@ ed al@@ co@@ hol &apos;s swe@@ et@@ ed sy@@ co@@ hol swe@@ et@@ ling .
so is this happening ?
law@@ yer : i &apos;m a law@@ y@@ man .
i &apos;m a tom .
now , we can &apos;t all be the click brand , but i &apos;m often looking at the inter@@ ior of the shel@@ f of the wall glamour and the ris@@ ky fly .
and what &apos;s realized was that i needed a law@@ suit .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who really could help me understand what you call the word person@@ ality .
and so i found a company called ol@@ son z@@ ø@@ man at pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ g .
they &apos;ve helped companies like ne@@ st@@ les , fe@@ cer@@ ous , symbol mark to dete@@ ct these sig@@ ns of wal@@ k@@ ness .
if you were able to do it for them , you could also help me .
they brought up your pain@@ t@@ ings , yes ?
that &apos;s what i have . the first picture is an image of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how it &apos;s lin@@ ked to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who are forming my world@@ view .
tell me about the world .
m@@ d : the world , i think , is the world in which you live -- how people around you , the friends , the friends , the family , the way you live with life , the work and stuff .
all of these things come out and start from a place , and i get them and i start with my family in west virg@@ ini@@ a .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what does this link to the thoughts and emotions about yourself ?
it &apos;s the way that i &apos;d like to be .
and i like things that are different .
i like things that are que@@ ac@@ able . i like a strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does it make us ?
what &apos;s the ma@@ che@@ ble ? what pu@@ p sta@@ dium are you now doing ?
why is it important to laun@@ ch up ? what does the red represents ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you that aren &apos;t you .
which one me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ als do they run through ?
... it doesn &apos;t have to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed . what kind of roll@@ er@@ land do you see ?
ee@@ d@@ e@@ e ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your own pleasure .
yeah . good . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be there .
there &apos;s a lot of crazy things going on with this .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her brand person@@ nel was separ@@ ated two separ@@ ated , but rema@@ ining pages -- the mor@@ gan sp@@ ri@@ per brand is an ei@@ ght-@@ ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ able brand brand .
the re@@ vel@@ ation is very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost one con@@ tradi@@ ction with that .
and i think some companies will only focus on a strength , rather than on both of them .
a lot of companies tend to do this -- and this is human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and that they &apos;re wel@@ come to them , and they &apos;re actually turning them into something positive , and that &apos;s a sk@@ un@@ k of sha@@ ke .
what other be@@ e@@ ks are doing ?
the first one is a classi@@ c , apple .
and you can see here , ner@@ ke , wi@@ i , min@@ i , min@@ i of min@@ i co@@ op@@ ers and je@@ t@@ -@@ blue .
well , there &apos;s collap@@ sed cra@@ cks and ei@@ gh@@ als of ei@@ gs , these things that come and go , but there &apos;s a break , an ei@@ ght-@@ ei@@ ve-@@ brand brand is a pretty strong thing .
an ei@@ gh@@ th , un@@ fol@@ ded card . what &apos;s your brand ?
if someone asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would you do ?
you &apos;re on a tour at@@ cu@@ day ? are you something that makes blood in the wh@@ ength ?
or are they more likely to be on a jum@@ -@@ at@@ ri@@ ble ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quie@@ t , prote@@ ctive , conser@@ va@@ tive , conser@@ va@@ tive ?
up@@ set at@@ tribu@@ tes are things that are play@@ ing@@ ual , fresh as the san prin@@ ce , journ@@ al , ad@@ vent@@ ure , and lo@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing and kin@@ dly as an@@ ol fl@@ yn@@ n , ver@@ k and agi@@ le and rhyth@@ m , and my@@ sti@@ r , ma@@ gical and my@@ sti@@ cally like gand@@ al@@ ss .
or are they more like a down@@ l-@@ at@@ t@@ ling ?
are you min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing and mon@@ li@@ n like 00@@ 7 ?
are they establi@@ shed , tradition@@ ally , nur@@ sions , vulnerable , com@@ passionate , com@@ passionate as op@@ ra@@ h ?
are they reli@@ able , stable , sla@@ ve , safe , sla@@ ved , sla@@ ved , wo@@ unded , and in terms of the d@@ al@@ ai lam@@ a or yo@@ da ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies and the &quot; no &quot; said , &quot; no , &quot; because they wanted to be part of the project .
most of them didn &apos;t want to do with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to happen 17 mar@@ k@@ ings who were willing to engage on this control that wanted to do with someone such as an ei@@ gh@@ le and coura@@ ging like me , and who eventually en@@ ab@@ led us to tell stories that we might not have told -- the stories that we didn &apos;t normally have to tell -- stories that would normally be suppor@@ ting a custom@@ er .
they com@@ pla@@ ined us to tell the story of neuro@@ marketing , as we tell the story in this film , that today you use mr@@ is to t@@ ack@@ le the pleasure centers of the brain , all about adverti@@ sing and films .
we went to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o , where we were ex@@ ecu@@ ted to sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no far@@ m far@@ m , no poster , no fl@@ yer , nothing .
and we went to school distri@@ ct in which companies are doing their way in di@@ ma@@ ted schools , across america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects of which i get the most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , the ones where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brand br@@ ands did .
because they went to the middle po@@ sters , they went to the agen@@ cies , and they said that the agen@@ cies might not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negoti@@ ate directly directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people get to thinking about , that our world@@ view is challen@@ ging .
and how did that do that for you ? what makes it successful ?
now , since the film came out of s@@ und@@ ance film festi@@ val , we can look at this .
according to bur@@ r@@ al , the pre@@ mi@@ er in janu@@ ary , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 9@@ 00 million squ@@ ie@@ ts of this movie .
it &apos;s actually only one year of two a half weeks of a year .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been issu@@ ed .
it &apos;s not even online yet . it &apos;s not a tre@@ eting .
he has not come out of other countries yet .
well , finally , the film has done a very big deal .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agen@@ cy that we talked about , re@@ com@@ men@@ ding their custom@@ ers to let the fing@@ ers go from it .
one of the things that i believe is that if you get your chance , there &apos;s risks that can make risks in these risks , in these risks .
i think if you keep people off of it , then you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepar@@ ing all the company , you &apos;re prepar@@ ing the whole company .
and i feel like we need to encoura@@ ge people to get risks .
we have to encoura@@ ge people not to have a fear of opportunities that they might be sc@@ ared .
finally , we should stop the fear of fear , we should wel@@ come fear .
we should put the bear in the c@@ age .
wel@@ come the fear of fear . do you hate the risk .
so , a big bu@@ ffer is made , so we &apos;re going to wel@@ come the risk .
and then finally , we should wel@@ come transpar@@ ency .
now , more than ever before , more than ever , brings us a little bit of hon@@ est@@ y .
and that said that , with hon@@ est@@ y and transpar@@ ency , my whole talk , &quot; they &apos;re wel@@ sum@@ ed transpar@@ ency , &quot; was pres@@ ented by my good friends of em@@ c , who paid $ 7@@ 0 for the name of e@@ bay .
big data is trans@@ formed in great opportunities all over the world in great opportunities .
em@@ c : &quot; they &apos;ll wel@@ come transpar@@ ency transpar@@ ency . &quot;
thank you very much .
now , mor@@ gan , in the name of transpar@@ ency , the transpar@@ ency of transpar@@ ency is , what &apos;s happened to the $ 7@@ 100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my po@@ ck , and i &apos;ve put on the director of the ted organization , the sa@@ pl@@ -@@ foundation -- a check in a $ 7@@ 0 , to fund my ted on the next year .
so my name is am@@ it .
so 18 months ago , i made something else at google , and i was involved to do something with muse@@ ums and art , and my che@@ f@@ in , who is now , and i gave them green light .
and it took pictures of 18 months .
a lot of fun skills and stories , i can tell you , at least 17 very interesting muse@@ ums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my own personal view is very easy to explain with this slide and its own access .
and i grew up in india .
i became a great education compon@@ ent -- i didn &apos;t satis@@ fy me -- but i had a lot of muse@@ ums , and i didn &apos;t have access to that art .
and as i travel@@ ed , and i started to go and visit these muse@@ ums , i started learning a lot of learning .
and while i was working for google , i tried to worry about this -- to make art more acc@@ essi@@ ble -- to bring technology together .
we then created a team , a great team , and we started this with this .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demon@@ stration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that started doing since that started .
so you &apos;re just going to google pas@@ sing proje@@ ct@@ .com .
you can see in all of these muse@@ ums here .
there &apos;s the u@@ ff@@ i@@ z@@ i , the mom@@ a , the other , the ri@@ j@@ les , the van go@@ gh , the van go@@ gh .
in fact , i &apos;m in one of my favorite , the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan museum of art in new york .
you go on two of them -- very simple .
tex@@ ture , and wh@@ ales , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bom@@ bay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make a difference .
you go around , and you recy@@ v@@ eil it .
you want to ori@@ ent yourself in the museum ?
open the map , and jump them with a click .
they are , they want to go to the end of the gan@@ ges .
just further . a lot of fun .
don &apos;t know .
thank you , but the best thing is coming .
so now , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , i &apos;m met by pie@@ ter bre@@ i@@ cks .
i see this t@@ us@@ sum@@ line .
if the museum gave us the image , we click on it .
now , this is one of the images .
these are all of the meta@@ data .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m going to click this down now .
this is one of the images that we &apos;ve ob@@ tain@@ ed with the so-@@ called gi@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ -@@ engineering technology .
this picture , for example , has about 10 billion pieces of pieces , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to do for 10 billion foot@@ points ? &quot;
so here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can go and zo@@ om in and zo@@ om in very easily .
you can see something fun here .
i love this guy ; the expression is un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able .
but then they really want to go deep into it .
and so i started playing around , and i noticed that there &apos;s something going on there .
and i was like , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
and i went close , and i realized slowly that these kids would actually er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate something .
i was a little bit earlier , talking with some familiar , and i actually found out that it &apos;s a game called squ@@ a@@ il , where a spr@@ int is cra@@ cked at the bottom of the shor@@ eline day with a stick .
appar@@ ently , it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
in order to go close , you can go to the s@@ ne@@ bs .
just to tell you , i zo@@ om out and zo@@ om out so you can see what you get .
so here we are , and this is the painting .
and the best thing is , in a second , goes forward .
so let &apos;s jump quickly to the mom@@ a , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , the wee@@ k@@ night .
in the previous example , it &apos;s been about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the br@@ ush stri@@ ke ?
and in fact , what if you want to see , how do you want to see the ma@@ ster@@ piece of this ma@@ ster@@ piece ?
you zo@@ om@@ ed in . you can actually go in .
i &apos;m going to zo@@ om into one of my favorite illu@@ ses of this image , until i really am in the sli@@ cks .
this is star@@ t night , probably before this before .
so now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot of others , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called colle@@ ction .
any one of you , anyone -- just if rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and create your own museum -- from all of these pictures you can put your own colle@@ ction .
very simple , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of zo@@ om -- you can zo@@ om around .
this is the sal@@ eting , &quot; in the national arts . &quot;
you can record everything with pres@@ ent@@ ations , send your friends , and you start with a conversation about what you feel when you look at this ma@@ ster@@ piece .
and i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all of the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even come out of the muse@@ ums .
i shouldn &apos;t be saying that .
and they come from the artists .
and that was a experience of hu@@ mili@@ ty for me .
i mean , i &apos;m hop@@ ing that we &apos;re going to be right with this digital media of art , and it &apos;s really present online .
and the big question that &apos;s been asked to me , &quot; did you do this to repli@@ cate the experience of a museum &apos;s experience ? &quot;
and the answer to that is no .
it &apos;s going to be the experience of effort .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing . thank you .
thank you very much .
this is a repres@@ entation of your brain . your brain can be sub@@ divi@@ ded in two areas .
this is the left half , which is the logi@@ cal side , and then the right half , which is the intui@@ tive side .
if we could have a scale to measure the ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ te of every he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , we could be able to point your brain .
for example , this would be somebody who is completely logi@@ cal .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intui@@ tive .
now , where would you choose your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided to have one of these extre@@ mes , but i think that , for most people in the audience , your brain looks something like this -- with a very high ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ te , which is at the same time in both he@@ mis@@ pher@@ es .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both ex@@ clu@@ si@@ ve or anything like that .
and they can be logi@@ cal and intui@@ tive .
and so i &apos;m looking at as one of the people , along with most other experiment@@ al quant@@ um physi@@ cians , who need a good share lo@@ gic to bring together the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good compon@@ ent to actually take the experiments in the same time .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we like to play it with things .
so we go out and play with it , and then we &apos;re looking at it , and then we &apos;re starting to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intui@@ tions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing at the same time can only be in a place .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that one thing at the same time in two different places is , but they haven &apos;t been born with this idea , they evolved it .
and i remember watching a kid playing on a hole th@@ res@@ hold .
he was a little kid , and not very good at it , and he was running all the time .
but i bet that playing it with the bottom of the ground , a very pre@@ cious lesson , which is , the big things don &apos;t just leave you , and that they stay at one place .
and this is a great concep@@ tual model in the world , as long as they &apos;re not a partic@@ le physi@@ c@@ ist .
it would be a horri@@ ble model for a partic@@ le physi@@ ci@@ sts , because they don &apos;t play with water s@@ ells , but with those little od@@ d particles .
and when they &apos;re playing with your particles , they make all kinds of weird things -- how they fly directly through walls , or they can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they wrote all of these obser@@ va@@ tions , and i called them the theory of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed to describe quant@@ um mechan@@ ics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t have to describe them to describe the big everyday objects around us .
now , it didn &apos;t have my intuition , and maybe just because i &apos;m not so often playing with partic@@ le games .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one ever saw a partic@@ le .
but my logi@@ cal side didn &apos;t wor@@ e it either .
because if all of these things are made out of particles , and all these particles are following the rules of the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , should not just follow the rules of the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics ?
i don &apos;t see why this shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i would feel more and more with the whole thing , if we could just show that everyday objects also would follow the rules of the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so a couple of years ago , i made this to do that .
i created one of them .
this is the first object that you can see that was in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is just a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green do@@ t there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is what i &apos;m doing here . we &apos;re looking at the center here in the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big clo@@ se@@ -up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , and it &apos;s kind of sha@@ ped like a lea@@ f board , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way that one computer makes a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new si@@ zes , and stre@@ t@@ ched for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this as a swi@@ mming pool of sculp@@ ted hole and the thing .
now , this thing has the ability to be the ability in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ical super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analog@@ y to you .
you know how aw@@ k@@ while it &apos;s in a ful@@ l-@@ section of being a complete th@@ ush ?
i mean , when i &apos;m alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , i do all kinds of weird things , but i &apos;ll go into other people , and i &apos;ll stop doing all of these things , because i don &apos;t want to hurt them with it , or , frank@@ ly , they &apos;re going to be sc@@ ra@@ sting .
so quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that non@@ verb@@ al objects feel just the same thing .
the auth@@ ors for dis@@ mov@@ able objects are not just humans , but the light that seems to them and the wind that is tor@@ ling on them and the heat that is over to you and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see this piece of metal , this piece of metal , we had to s@@ wal@@ ink all the way out of the whole chain .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we swi@@ t@@ ched the light , put it into a vac@@ u@@ um , and we put it all the air , and cool@@ ing it up to all the way down , just in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the piece of metal was free to be@@ have as anything it wanted .
so , we measu@@ red its movement .
and we realized that it &apos;s really kind of moving .
instead of it , it &apos;s just sil@@ ent , it &apos;s vi@@ br@@ ated . the way it was vi@@ br@@ ated was something like this -- it &apos;s sort of an exten@@ sion and inter@@ rup@@ tive bubble in the air .
in which we gave him a little push , we were able to vi@@ bra@@ te it at the same time and not to vi@@ bra@@ te -- something which is just in the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
so what i &apos;m just going to talk about is what &apos;s truly fantastic .
what does it mean to vi@@ bra@@ te and not to vi@@ bra@@ te at the same time at the same time ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms from which the piece of metal is sil@@ ent and sil@@ ent , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down the same time .
just to pre@@ ce@@ tious peri@@ und@@ scap@@ es , they vote over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ u@@ si@@ fied .
that means that each at@@ om at the same time in two different places , which is , at the same time , that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
and i think that &apos;s really cool .
that &apos;s .
and that &apos;s what it takes me to do for all these year in the clean space , because , check this , the gap difference between one single at@@ om , and this piece of metal is about a single at@@ om , and this piece of metal is about the difference between the piece of metal and you
so if a single at@@ cle@@ om@@ a can be at the same time at the same time in two different places , this piece of metal in two different places , why not do it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logi@@ cal side says .
so imagine if you were to be at the same time at the same time , how would it feel like that ?
how would your consciousness deal that your body is del@@ oc@@ alized in the space ?
and there &apos;s another aspe@@ ct of the story .
when we heat it , we swi@@ t@@ ched the light , and we looked in the box , we saw that piece of metal was always in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition , that it looks like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ation is actually only stress objects that are spu@@ ned together in a small space .
you &apos;re hearing a lot of answers about how quant@@ um mechan@@ ics says that everything is connected to everything .
now , that &apos;s not exactly right .
there &apos;s even more behind it , it gets even deeper .
it &apos;s like these connections , their connection with all the things around them , literally reali@@ zing who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and weird of the quant@@ um mechan@@ ics .
thank you very much .
in 2007 , i decided that we should re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize the way we think about economic evolution .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they &apos;re going to live and to work and work , they &apos;ve been given the opportunity to choose between at least one of a hand full of different cities , who are all in competition , are about new resi@@ dents
at the moment , we are far away from this target .
there are billions of people in developing countries , which is not even a single city that they would wel@@ come .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more value than building it .
so we could easily get the world very easily with jo@@ int , perhaps even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound ab@@ sur@@ d for them , as far as they &apos;ve never thought about new cities , too .
you just swa@@ p out the a@@ part@@ ments on the cities of cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in a@@ part@@ ments , they &apos;ve already lived this ; the other half is not yet .
they could try to exp@@ and the capacity of the capacity of exi@@ sting a@@ part@@ ments .
but , you know , you know , in these homes , in these homes and their surro@@ und@@ ings , you know , to avoid fail@@ ures and their surro@@ und@@ ings to prevent the difference .
so it turns out it &apos;s very difficult to get all of these exten@@ sions .
but you could go to a completely new place , create a whole new hous@@ ing , en@@ ab@@ ling the laws there would support you and not to do it .
so i suggest@@ ed that governments are creating new areas that provide enough space for a city , and i gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
later , i &apos;ve found that , roughly around the same time , h@@ 4 and oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o about the challenge of the challenge of a re@@ form in hon@@ dur@@ as .
they knew that every year about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans would leave their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do , to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in hon@@ dur@@ as .
at this point , h@@ 4 to oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o said , &quot; what happens if we take a dis@@ rup@@ ted surface of our country -- what happens if we just give them a message -- a part of the american em@@ pi@@ re , a part of the can@@ adi@@ an plat@@ ury -- and if people want to work in the can@@ adi@@ an rules , or the united states , can you work there , and we can do everything on the surface of these mes@@ sages , what would you normally have to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , hon@@ dur@@ as suff@@ ered in a ri@@ gh@@ ten@@ y const@@ ant crisis .
in the next design elec@@ tions , pe@@ pe lo@@ bo , in a bran@@ ch , his program was both talking about both innova@@ tions , and a lot of pain .
and he dem@@ and@@ ed oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o to become his stable li@@ d@@ pan .
and in the mean@@ time , i was prepar@@ ing on a talk at ted@@ global .
through impro@@ v@@ ements , try and explore and investi@@ gate consum@@ ers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of char@@ ter city to the fundamental elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that deter@@ mine that you can &apos;t care exi@@ sting life ow@@ ners .
we give new technologies great ad@@ vice , but for progress , it needs technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
in 2010 , a friend of gu@@ atem@@ ala oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ o sent the link to the ted@@ talk to the ted@@ talk .
he showed him ja@@ y@@ 4 .
the two one were called me .
and he said , &quot; let &apos;s take that the head of our country ! &quot;
so , in dec@@ ember , we met in the beach room of a hotel in mi@@ ami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they &apos;re expen@@ se .
and i &apos;ve used this graph to show you how pre@@ cious ro@@ hl@@ and is in a place like new york , and think that there &apos;s a sphere in some cases per square meter per square meter per square meter .
but it was a fairly abstra@@ ct discussion , at one point when there was a break , oc@@ ta@@ zz@@ o said , &quot; paul , we may be able to look at the ted@@ talk . &quot;
so the ted@@ talk set in a very simple form that a char@@ ter city is a place whose first un@@ lived country , a fo@@ und@@ ly contra@@ ct that determin@@ es the laws that gover@@ ns there and people the ability to decide , either among those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hon@@ dur@@ as , who said we had to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is going to bring forward to our country .
i was asked to come to te@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ pa , and i was asked a lec@@ ture and a fif@@ th janu@@ ary .
so , i &apos;ve kept another one with a wise talk that has contribu@@ ted a graph like this , trying to illu@@ strate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city den@@ ver , and the sk@@ et@@ ch shows the new air@@ port , which was built in den@@ ver .
in fact , even this air@@ port has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
so what i &apos;ve been trying to convince the hon@@ ants is to convince a new city , if you want to build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with one area of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand hours .
poli@@ t@@ ly , they &apos;re all pr@@ opp@@ ing .
the faces of the audience were very seriously and care@@ ful .
the director of con@@ gress came up at the stage and said , &quot; professor ro@@ mer , thank you very much thank you very much for your talk , but we might be able to look very much the ted@@ talk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so , i sat down , and they played the ted@@ talk .
and i came to the core of the fact that a new city provi@@ des people new choices .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in hon@@ dur@@ as , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city is also provi@@ ding new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in hon@@ dur@@ as were depen@@ dent on the aid of partner@@ y countries , they could benefit from their coll@@ ar countries that they could be suppor@@ ted in the face of the law for this char@@ ter , and that everybody could trust that everyone could trust that the char@@ ter was really going to be launched .
and the insi@@ ght of president lo@@ bo , was that the certain@@ ty of the dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ dness that i thought about as a way to get foreign inv@@ e@@ stors to come and build this city for all of the par@@ ties in hon@@ dur@@ as that suff@@ ered in a lot of years in fear and mis@@ str@@ en@@ ce .
we &apos;ve been in a field .
this is a picture of this place .
it &apos;s a thou@@ ght@@ less thousand square kilometers .
and shor@@ tly after , on janu@@ ary of janu@@ ary , in the 19@@ th of janu@@ ary , they agre@@ ed with a change of the const@@ it@@ ution to have a particular kind of policy that is essential for specific development .
in a country , which has just been a terrible crisis , it was ele@@ cted in con@@ gress for 1@@ 24 to a voice change with 1@@ 24 to a voice .
all of the par@@ ties , all the conver@@ sa@@ tions of society , suppor@@ ted this .
to be part of the const@@ it@@ ution , it needs to be appro@@ ved by con@@ gress , but it has to be appro@@ ved
on febru@@ ary of febru@@ ary on febru@@ ary , the second time at febru@@ ary was appro@@ ved to a voice .
immediately after that ele@@ ction , between the 21@@ st and the 24@@ th , a d@@ ele@@ gation of about 30 bucks to the two places in the world who were most interested in the world , most of which were interested in the business of the city .
the one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big new urban midd@@ le-@@ class , which is built in south korea , big than the city ar@@ row of the city .
everything that you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the per@@ mit@@ tr@@ ation of it .
the other place that &apos;s been very interested in the city is sing@@ apo@@ re .
it &apos;s already been built two cities in china , and the third one is in prepar@@ ation .
so if you think prac@@ tically about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a building piece , and you &apos;ve already looked at that area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that mana@@ gers are allowed to participa@@ te , and it &apos;s also working on a very ex@@ ternal law system .
a country already has off@@ ered its su@@ pre@@ me court , as a dis@@ h for the exc@@ ei@@ ve appe@@ ar@@ ance of the neighbor@@ est system of the con@@ temporary system
and also , urban designers and blu@@ ers are very interested in .
they even get fund@@ raising with them .
and one of the things you know , it &apos;s already been done , there &apos;s a lot of r@@ inn@@ ers .
there are a lot of businesses that would like to be con@@ stra@@ ined in america , especially in a place with free trade , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people who assu@@ me that they &apos;d like to live perman@@ ently in a different place .
a million people dro@@ pped la@@ tin america , and they &apos;re going to the united states .
many of them are fa@@ thers who are forced to leave their families to watch their family , sometimes are the single single parents who need to ear@@ n money to make their food and clo@@ th@@ es .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children who are trying to find their parents who , in some cases , have not seen their parents , in some cases , not seen .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about hon@@ dur@@ as in hon@@ dur@@ as , an entirely new city ?
or do you even build du@@ t@@ ess@@ ness from these cities , or hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of them ?
so what is it for an idea to ins@@ ist that every family has a choice between multiple cities , who are in competition , are in competition of new resi@@ dents
this is an idea which is increasingly re@@ distribu@@ ting .
so my friends from hon@@ dur@@ as have asked me , thank you ted .
you know , how many decisions you &apos;re doing in a typical day ?
you know , how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve made a po@@ ll on about 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , which is expected to be a typical american on a day , is 70 .
interest@@ ingly , a study was done with ce@@ os , where they saw the ce@@ os for a week .
and these scientists have just docum@@ ented the various subje@@ cts that these ce@@ o are doing , and how much time they &apos;re doing them to do with decisions that are connected to the top@@ ics .
and what they &apos;ve found is that a average ce@@ o is working on the week at the age of 13@@ 9 .
each of these subje@@ ctive subje@@ cts , of course , was made out of many , many smaller decisions .
fif@@ ty percent of their decisions have been hit within nine minutes or less .
just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you &apos;re doing in the nine minutes of categ@@ ory against those who are in the last nine minutes ?
how good , do you think , are you posi@@ tion@@ ing the decisions in this ?
today , i &apos;d like to talk about one of the greatest decisi@@ on-@@ making of our modern time , the decisi@@ on-@@ circu@@ it problem problem .
i &apos;d like to talk about the problem and some kinds of solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you a couple of questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise you , because i &apos;m blind , just your hand , if you want to burn some cal@@ ories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i give you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is , are you ready to hear about the decision over@@ la@@ sting problem problem ?
thank you very much .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very , very pre@@ valent gro@@ und@@ ings , at least , he was really ex@@ clu@@ si@@ vely ex@@ clu@@ si@@ ve .
it was a store that was wir@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
this business , it was almost just as a jo@@ int partner .
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ d and cal@@ t@@ ens and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ it and vege@@ tables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of water -- and this was at a time when we actually dro@@ pped wir@@ i@@ on water .
i loved it to go to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , you know , how is it that you never buy something ?
here &apos;s the o@@ live oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including the ones that were lo@@ cked in bo@@ xes that came from thousands of years old o@@ vi@@ c trees .
so , one day i decided to go to the top , and i asked the board , &quot; does this model work that you really offer the people of all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed on the bush char@@ ges of tou@@ ri@@ sts , who came up every day and they were usually having their c@@ ameras in it .
so we decided to do an experiment , and we cho@@ se mar@@ ch &apos;s for our experiment .
here &apos;s your brand ri@@ pp@@ ings .
they had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of mar@@ star@@ ge .
we put up a little bar@@ re@@ l on the ent@@ r@@ ance of business .
we put up six different fla@@ vor@@ s of fla@@ vor@@ s or 24 different fla@@ vor@@ s of fla@@ vor@@ s , and we looked at two things : one , i &apos;d looked at two things : first of all , i would stay to more people and try to try to try to see mars &apos;s time ?
it &apos;s more people left when there were 24 percent , about 60 percent , than when they were six percent , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at that , in which case , people bought a glass mar@@ ch of mar@@ ch .
now , we saw the rever@@ se effect .
of the people who were sitting there , when there were 24 percent , there was only three percent of a glass mar@@ star@@ ge .
from the people who kept there , when there were six percent , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mar@@ ch .
well , if you calcul@@ ated it , people would buy six times more likely a glass of mar@@ ch that they had six to vote than if they had 24 to choices .
now , not buying a glass mar@@ ch is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our tr@@ at -- but it turns out that the decision over@@ la@@ sting problem is affec@@ ting us in very con@@ sequence of very consi@@ der@@ ate decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even if it comes against our own best interests .
so the theme of day : financial sav@@ ings .
i &apos;m going to show you a study that i &apos;m going to tell you with gu@@ r hu@@ ber@@ man , who , to me , ran through the fact that we &apos;ve seen the decisions of attra@@ cting decisions for almost a million americans from about 6@@ 50 miles in the entire united states .
and what we saw was , if the number of windows that had been possible to have a reti@@ re@@ ment sav@@ ings plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , the prob@@ ability affec@@ ts whether more for tomorrow is going to be saved .
and what we found was that indeed , in fact , there was a relationship .
so in these devices , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 meters that would attack people between two to 5@@ 9 different f@@ on@@ ds .
and what we found was that the more fund were ele@@ cted , that , in fact , the participa@@ tion was getting worse .
now , if you look at the extreme look , the plans that attac@@ ks two f@@ on@@ ds , they had a series of part@@ -@@ read@@ ings in the 7@@ 0s -- still not as much as we want .
in the plans that explo@@ des almost 60 pan@@ ths , the band@@ -@@ en@@ vel@@ tr@@ ation went to about the six@@ th percent of the percent .
now it turns out that even if they &apos;re ex@@ clu@@ ding themselves , when they &apos;re ele@@ cting , even more opportunities , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participa@@ te , more , more to the fact that the more opportunities they gave them , the more they ignor@@ ed it and the fund .
the more opportunities they gave them , the more they would add their entire money into c@@ ure &apos;s own market accoun@@ ts .
none of those extreme decisions , according to the decisions that someone would re@@ com@@ men@@ d , if we care about their future financial health care .
well , in the last 10 years , in humans , we &apos;ve seen three cru@@ cial negative consequences that cause them from more and more choices .
they s@@ hr@@ ink the decision -- push them , even if it comes to their own existence .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financial financial and worse , and more health care .
they decide more for things that you give yourself less satis@@ ble , even if they make it obje@@ ctive better .
the main reason about this is that we might enjoy this huge shel@@ ves full of may@@ on@@ a@@ ise , mu@@ ff , dis@@ k , dis@@ k and mar@@ ch and mar@@ ch , but we can &apos;t be able to pull the compar@@ ison and the limit@@ ations , and then in fact , choose something from the magni@@ fi@@ cent offer .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve te@@ sted in different ways and across different research places -- that you can just use in your business .
first of all , con@@ stra@@ int .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , and it &apos;s never been true .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; con@@ stra@@ ined . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they &apos;re losing ground space .
but in fact , we &apos;re finding it more and more , that if you &apos;re willing to restri@@ ct and get rid of the un@@ important fundamental possibility , well , then there &apos;s a ris@@ ing increase , it &apos;s going to be the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a way of impro@@ vement of decisi@@ on-@@ making .
when pro@@ ctor and gam@@ ble had dec@@ lin@@ ed the different head and white species of 26 to 15 , they were experi@@ en@@ cing a ris@@ ing increase by 10 percent of the time .
when the golden c@@ at corpo@@ ration gave birth 10 the worst selling cat@@ sin@@ fit@@ us , they learned that the prof@@ its went up to 8@@ 7 percent -- a result of both , the increase of the cost of selling and re@@ duc@@ ing costs .
you know , the average super@@ ma@@ cr@@ i today , they &apos;ll give you 4@@ 5,000 products .
a typical wal@@ m@@ art is off@@ ering you 100,000 products today .
but the nin@@ e-@@ largest super@@ market , which is the nin@@ e-@@ largest super@@ market in the world today , is al@@ di , and they &apos;re only provi@@ ding 1,@@ 400 products -- a kind of to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce in do@@ ses .
now in the world of sav@@ ings , i think one of the very best examples that have come on to the market , how to tell the best choices , was something that david la@@ ga@@ son has created very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s being off@@ ered at harvard .
now , every single harvard harvard fund is auto@@ matically accep@@ ting in a life@@ -@@ time age .
the ones who really want to make a choice will be killed 20 pay@@ s , not 300 or more fund .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i should li@@ ft it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the choices are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t hold them apart , it can &apos;t be your custom@@ ers either . &quot;
now , before we started with lunch today , i had a conversation with g@@ ary .
and g@@ ary said that he would be willing to provide all the people in this audience , an all@@ -@@ en@@ danger@@ ed ho@@ li@@ day to the most beautiful streets in the world .
so here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the street .
and i &apos;d like to read to you that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i &apos;ll ask you to cla@@ p , if you &apos;re willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s employees .
okay . anyone who is willing to take g@@ ary &apos;s off@@ ering .
all of all , are all of this ?
well , let me show you a little bit more of it .
you knew , it was a trick with it , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
and i think i may have heard more hands .
all right .
the fact is that you looked at mir@@ enting , the first time more information than the second time , but i would make you feel that it felt real at the second time , and i would feel that it was real .
because the pain@@ t@@ ings are consum@@ ing it for them to feel real .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of decision over@@ la@@ pping , it &apos;s the con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
what it &apos;s about is that people to understand the difference between opportunities , understanding what consequences are associated with , what consequences are associated with the other possibilities , and that has to be satis@@ fi@@ ed to this consequences and so that that consequences have to be vi@@ vid and so that it
why do people spend average to 30 percent more than they use a ec@@ me card or a credit card , than in a bar@@ en card , than a bar@@ di@@ t card
because it &apos;s not that it &apos;s not really a money .
and it turns out that when you make it something that makes something , it &apos;s a very good tool so that you can get people to save more .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i created with s@@ hl@@ om@@ o ben@@ ar@@ tz@@ i and al@@ ess@@ and@@ r@@ o soft@@ ter@@ o , we &apos;ve done a study with people -- employees who worked for teaching -- and these people were all in a gather@@ ing where they &apos;ve sent their participa@@ tion for their reti@@ re@@ ment business sche@@ re@@ -up .
and during that gather@@ ing , we &apos;ve had these colle@@ ction the same way that it &apos;s always been , except we &apos;ve ad@@ ded a little bit of a little bit of it .
the little thing that we had agre@@ ed to is that we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were going to save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participa@@ tion by 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or grow by four percent by the amount they were willing to pay for the sav@@ ant accoun@@ ts .
the third techni@@ que : categ@@ ori@@ zation .
we can make more categ@@ ories than to deal with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a library of time .
it turns out that in the tren@@ ches of super@@ markets on top of super@@ markets and below the nor@@ the@@ ast area , the number of 3@@ 3@@ 1 different types of maga@@ zin@@ es have had the number between 3@@ 6@@ 4 maga@@ zin@@ es .
but , you know what ?
if i show you 600 maga@@ zin@@ es and i share them in 10 categ@@ ories , or i &apos;m showing you 400 maga@@ zin@@ es , and they &apos;re tun@@ ing in 20 categ@@ ories , then they believe that i gave them more choices and a better choice , when i had given them the 400 of them , and have given them a better choice about that if i gave them the 400 .
because categ@@ ories tell me how i can hold them apart .
so here are two different je@@ tles of je@@ wel@@ ry out there .
one is called &quot; ja@@ zz , &quot; and the other is called s@@ v@@ . .
if you think the left display s@@ mile is s@@ wing , and the display on the right ja@@ zz is , you cla@@ p into your hands .
okay , so there &apos;s a couple of them .
if you think that on the left hand side is ja@@ zz , and the one on the right is s@@ wing , please cla@@ p , please cla@@ p .
okay , so a couple more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is ja@@ zz , and the guy on the right is s@@ wing , but you know what ?
this is a highly un@@ comfortable categ@@ ory of categ@@ ori@@ zation .
categ@@ ories need to tell the vote to tell something , not one who provi@@ des the sele@@ ction .
and this problem often shows you , when you look at the long line of all of these f@@ on@@ ds .
who do you really want to in@@ form with this ?
my fourth technology : anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion of complexity .
and it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to just feel simple .
we need to increase the complexity slowly slowly .
so let me show you an example of what i mean .
so let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the c@@ at of a car .
here &apos;s a ger@@ man car manufac@@ tur@@ er that allows you to con@@ figu@@ pa@@ te your car completely self-@@ repli@@ c@@ ating .
they have to make 6@@ 2 different decisions to completely design their car completely .
now , these choices in the number of choices in the number of choices that they offer per choice .
car colors , outside of the car -- i &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
motor mot@@ ors , ge@@ ar -- four choices .
so what i &apos;m doing now is , i &apos;m going to change the order in which the decisions are .
half of the custom@@ ers are going to be by the many ways , 5@@ 6 auto@@ faces to the low possibility , four species of dri@@ ves .
the other half of the custom@@ ers are from the low possibility , four ge@@ ards , to the 5@@ 6 auto@@ faces , a lot of possibilities .
what do i look looking at ?
how they &apos;re interested in .
if you &apos;re going to use the standard choice in the decision , it &apos;s meant you &apos;re going to be over@@ pres@@ sed , the heal@@ ing , i anno@@ b you .
and what you find is that the people who are interpre@@ ting from the amount of money , the people who pick out and over and over and over again the standard choice .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choice to the many , then they stay with it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is to change the order in which this information is being pres@@ ented .
when i get to the very simple interview , i &apos;ll teach you how i choose out .
even though the ge@@ ars pick up , nothing about my pre@@ fer@@ ences , i &apos;m still going to say it &apos;s still going to take me to go ahead .
it also dri@@ ves me in exc@@ ell@@ ence about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to encoura@@ ge myself with interest with interest .
so let me wra@@ p up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that are the problem of decision over@@ la@@ pping -- restri@@ ction -- are they going to go through the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming alternative ; con@@ cre@@ t -- do it real ; we can categ@@ ori@@ ze more categ@@ ories , less opportunities ; to worry about complexity , prepar@@ ing on complexity .
now , every one of these techniques i &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today is to help you the possibility -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , you can use it for yourself , good for the people who they offer services .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re sel@@ ec@@ ted to sele@@ ction .
and the more we choose by sel@@ ec@@ ting , the better we will be able to be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m kev@@ in por@@ c@@ ca , tr@@ end@@ s-@@ man@@ ager at youtube , i &apos;m watching youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today , let &apos;s talk about how video will become vi@@ ral vi@@ ral , and gradu@@ ally , why it &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ty , sing@@ er , com@@ edi@@ ans , com@@ edi@@ ans -- when i was young , it seemed to be so infin@@ itely difficult .
but web videos allows us to be in@@ san@@ e that we can all be in@@ san@@ e , or all of our creative activi@@ ties in a part of the culture of our world .
every single single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next satur@@ day .
but on youtube , more than 4@@ 8 hours of video is u@@ plo@@ aded up a minute .
again , again , there &apos;s only a tiny percentage ever vi@@ ral , and it &apos;s going to be more vi@@ tal and it &apos;s going to be thousands of times and so on to the cultural moment .
so , how does this work ?
three things : ta@@ ste@@ makers , part@@ -@@ based communities and the un@@ expected one .
well , so we want to .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god !
wo@@ w !
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , wo@@ w@@ w@@ . !
last year , soft@@ vas@@ que@@ z opened this video he had fil@@ med in front of his house in yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te national park .
in 2010 , it &apos;s been looked at 23 million times .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was popular last summer for the first time .
in fact , i don &apos;t want to do a vi@@ ral video .
and he just wanted to share one rain@@ bo@@ w .
because you can do that when you &apos;re secre@@ ting yo@@ se@@ mi@@ te mountain secre@@ ts .
he had sp@@ opp@@ ed a lot of natural video .
and this video was actually sent in janu@@ ary in janu@@ ary .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
there was j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ a .
j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ a sent the t@@ we@@ et , who made the t@@ we@@ et at the end of the day .
because ta@@ ste@@ maker like j@@ im@@ my k@@ im@@ a puts us new and interesting things , and they show a big audience .
so , fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day . god get on fri@@ day , right on fri@@ day . heart clas@@ ses to the wee@@ k@@ room , wee@@ k@@ ward . fri@@ day , fri@@ day , fri@@ day . fri@@ pp@@ er &apos;@@ stage &apos; stage fri@@ day . you didn &apos;t think we were going to lead this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
re@@ bec@@ ca bl@@ ac@@ k &apos;s &quot; fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular vide@@ ar@@ u@@ ters of the year .
it &apos;s been looked at almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graphi@@ cs looked like .
just like &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , &quot; it seems like nothing has come from .
what &apos;s going on this day ?
well , it was fri@@ day , it &apos;s fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
if you want to know it , these other spi@@ kes are fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed .
so , what about this day , this particular fri@@ day ?
now , to@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 put it up , lots of blogs started writing about it .
michael j@@ . nel@@ son from the myster@@ y science theater was one of the first one that made a jo@@ ke on twitter .
what &apos;s important is that a single person or a group of ta@@ ste@@ ers took a stand@@ point , with a big audience , and acceler@@ ating the process .
and then this community created by people who shared this big insi@@ der , and they started talking about it and appl@@ ying around with it .
now there are 10,000 par@@ es@@ u@@ es of fri@@ day at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a par@@ o@@ dy for every single hour of day .
unlike the next entertain@@ ing entertain@@ ment of the 20th century , the commun@@ ation of community &apos;s participa@@ tion is to become our way towards this phenomenon -- either by spre@@ ading it , or something new .
&quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; is anima@@ tion and music at a complete loo@@ p of music .
that &apos;s it , it &apos;s very simple .
this year , it &apos;s been looked at about 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-@@ hour version of that that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
even cat@@ ching cat@@ s look at this video .
cat@@ s are looking at cat@@ s that look at this video .
the importance of creativity , the creativity that has been known in the internet culture of tech@@ ologi@@ ons and ge@@ e@@ ks .
there were re@@ mix@@ es .
someone made a nasa &apos;s version of it .
and then it became us internation@@ ally .
a whole re@@ mi@@ x community came out of the ground that made it from a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we all can participa@@ te in .
today , we don &apos;t just find the pleasure of something that we &apos;re doing .
who could have been able to look at this ?
who could have predi@@ cted &quot; double rain@@ bo@@ w , &quot; or re@@ bec@@ ca black or &quot; n@@ y@@ an c@@ at &quot; ?
what scri@@ ve books can you write in which that &apos;s what it &apos;s meant to mean
in a world where every minute two days of video dri@@ ves video foot@@ age can only be unique and un@@ expected and un@@ expected , as they mentioned videos .
i ad@@ mit@@ ted , i was not very interested when a friend told me i was looking at this great video , about a guy who prote@@ sted in new york against ra@@ kes for bi@@ cy@@ cles for bi@@ cy@@ cles .
i got a ti@@ cket , because i didn &apos;t get out of the whe@@ el , but there &apos;s a lot of dis@@ abilities that don &apos;t let go on the bi@@ kes of the whe@@ el .
since this was completely surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , cas@@ ey c@@ ø@@ s was funny idea , and he was looking at five million times .
this approach is true for everything new that we &apos;re doing crea@@ tively .
and all of that leads to the one big question .
so what does that mean ?
o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
so what does that mean ?
ta@@ ste@@ makers , creative partici@@ pants , completely un@@ expected , are the fe@@ atures of a new kind of media and culture that each of them has access and in which the audience is pres@@ ented with pres@@ ent@@ ity .
as i said , one of the largest stars -- ju@@ stin bie@@ ber -- made his beginning at youtube .
nobody has to give up their ideas of green light .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling as the ow@@ ner of our brand culture .
and these aren &apos;t the characteri@@ stics of ancient media , and they &apos;re har@@ dly achie@@ ving the media from today , but they &apos;re going to deter@@ mine the entertain@@ ment of the future .
thank you very much .
how can i talk in 10 minutes about the inter@@ connec@@ ty between women over three generations , and how the amazing power@@ s of this connec@@ ty was mani@@ fest@@ ated in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl , when she was sitting with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother and her grandmother was sitting in a little boat in the chinese sea -- a little girl that spar@@ ked in san francisco and never yet disappe@@ ared -- this little girl who lives in san francisco and talk about them today ?
the story isn &apos;t over yet .
it &apos;s a puzz@@ le that is still being put together .
i &apos;d like to tell you about some of the puzz@@ le pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who bur@@ ns his life &apos;s work .
he &apos;s a po@@ et , a writer , a man whose whole life , has been held together by the simple hope of space and freedom of his home .
if you think of him in the face of the sa@@ ig@@ on in sa@@ ig@@ on , how he has to stand up , his life has been a single waste of waste .
the words , as long as his friends , they &apos;re be@@ asing his own .
he went back to the sil@@ ence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grand@@ father .
i never met him in a little bit .
but our lives are so much more than our memor@@ ies .
my grandmother never for@@ gotten me with his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t appropriate , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to cr@@ ush us , but we came up with it .
the next piece of the puzz@@ le is how a boat hits the very early colum@@ n in the early y@@ ard of the morning .
my mother ma@@ i was 18 , when her father died -- in an ar@@ row marriage , with two little girls , they had two little girls
for her , she had a task for her : the dra@@ ce of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely complete that they could fail to fail .
after a four@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds and film@@ ri@@ ffer , sa@@ ga lim@@ el br@@ att , fell down to the la@@ ke as a fis@@ we@@ y@@ boat .
and all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had from pir@@ ates , ra@@ pe and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wor@@ e a little tox@@ in bottle .
at a pris@@ on@@ er , my sister had only had my sister and i , you know , drin@@ ked my grandmother and my grandmother .
my first memor@@ ies are from this boat -- the ever@@ ings of the engine , cla@@ pping one of the wave on the bay , the distance and the blan@@ k hori@@ zon .
i wouldn &apos;t remember the pi@@ ols that had come many times , but the death coura@@ ge of the men would be dra@@ wn on our boat , or the inci@@ dent of the engine who didn &apos;t want to go up six hours .
but i remember the lights of the air plat@@ forms before the mal@@ ay@@ an coast , and the young man who broke up and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the fla@@ vor of the first apple , which one of the men would be on the platform .
no apple has ever cra@@ cked again like this .
after three months in a re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
and the next piece of puzz@@ le is from four women in three generations , who are building a new life together .
we &apos;d ski@@ cked down in ph@@ sc@@ ray , one by the work@@ ing-@@ class community , which consi@@ ded the population of im@@ migr@@ ants of im@@ migr@@ ants
unlike in the age of the 20th middle class , whose existence was absolutely un@@ known to me , in ph@@ sc@@ ra , there was no sugge@@ sti@@ on of a conc@@ ei@@ ve .
the sc@@ or@@ es from the la@@ st@@ les came from the rest of the world .
and the f@@ at@@ al engli@@ sh@@ ers were hand@@ ed between people who had one thing in common : they started to get re@@ vie@@ wed .
my mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a flying factory , on a car factory , six days , dou@@ ble@@ ed s@@ wo@@ died .
it somehow allowed you to find the time to get both english and al@@ ph@@ an@@ cations .
so we were poor .
every dollar was awar@@ ded , and it was made in another education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do , and most of the time the new things that had always came out of a second hand .
two few str@@ ings for school , each one to cover the holes in other rooms .
a school uni@@ form up to the sna@@ kes , because it had to be six years .
and there were the rare but pain@@ ful ch@@ un@@ ks of &quot; bad eye &quot; and there and there are pain@@ t@@ ings : &quot; asi@@ tin , go home . &quot;
after home , where ?
something bo@@ g@@ ged in me .
there was a meeting to re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation and a quie@@ t voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
and my mother , my sister and i sle@@ pt in the same bed .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we stopped listening to our grandmother &apos;s mov@@ ements in the house .
my mother suff@@ ered in gu@@ il@@ ty from the boat .
and it was my job to stay off every night , until their ni@@ sters came up , so i could s@@ wal@@ ink them .
and they opened a computer business , and then created a co@@ s@@ me@@ tic education and opened up a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t es@@ cape change , an@@ gry and un@@ flexi@@ ble , and more sensitive kids , tra@@ pped between two worl@@ ds .
lo@@ ans and spon@@ sor@@ s were se@@ arch@@ ed .
centers have been built .
i was living in par@@ alle@@ l worl@@ ds .
one of the classi@@ c asi@@ an student , i was the classi@@ c dem@@ a@@ tic student , who put up the question of themselves .
in the other hand , i was involved in un@@ safe life , the tra@@ gic sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ds of violence , the drug mis@@ posite and the insu@@ lation .
but many years ago , there were a lot of help .
and because of that help , i was ele@@ cted as a young austr@@ alist at the last year of ju@@ schwi@@ gu@@ ship .
and i was focused from a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece , and the ed@@ ges didn &apos;t go together .
tan le , anony@@ mous hous@@ ing in ph@@ sc@@ ray , was now syl@@ le , re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e and social activ@@ ist , who was invited to talk about places that they never heard of , and in hous@@ ing , whose existence they never could have imag@@ ined .
i was not familiar with the lab@@ els .
and i didn &apos;t know how to use the bri@@ be .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about ro@@ es .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about something about anything .
i wanted to go back to the r@@ out@@ ine and the conven@@ i@@ ence of the life of an un@@ known pre@@ ce@@ ction -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters who closed each of their days as they had been told for 20 years by telling each other the stories of their day and sig@@ ning , we still have three still in the same bed .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
and she remin@@ ded me that i was so old when we got the boat clim@@ bed the boat .
no one had never been an opportunity .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; and it doesn &apos;t mean what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about ju@@ ven@@ -@@ educ@@ ated and education , and the inci@@ dence of the mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized and de@@ gra@@ dation of the gold .
and the open@@ er i was talking about , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all their lives , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limit@@ s of what they loved .
and though i had gradu@@ ated , i realized that i could not be able to find a career in j@@ ur@@ a .
there had to be another piece of a piece of answers .
and i realized at the same time , that it &apos;s okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a new@@ -@@ time , new in the image -- and not just okay , but something that you have to be gr@@ ate@@ ful , maybe a gift of the boat .
and because of that , it can lead to the collapse of the hori@@ zon , it can be so easy that you &apos;re accep@@ ted the assu@@ mp@@ tions of the environment .
now , i &apos;ve gone out enough from my ob@@ li@@ gation to know that , yes , the world is breaking apart , but not the way you worry about it .
opportunities that couldn &apos;t have been allowed were extra@@ ordin@@ arily acc@@ essi@@ ble .
there was a energy , an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented optimis@@ m , a strange fra@@ c@@ ture of hu@@ mili@@ ty and the wa@@ g@@ ling .
so , i followed my gut feeling .
i colle@@ cted a little bunch of people around me , for which the word &quot; wasn &apos;t &quot; not &quot; an im@@ men@@ se challenge . &quot;
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a ph@@ ph@@ y@@ ye .
at the end of one day , i &apos;d co@@ ok a huge dou@@ f sou@@ p that we shared .
and we worked late to the night .
most of our ideas were mad , but they were a few brilliant things about it , and we made the break@@ through .
and i met the decision to pull into the u.@@ s .
after just a trip there .
my gut clo@@ s@@ est .
three months later , i was raised , and the ad@@ vent@@ ure went .
before i close the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
it grew up at a time when con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local mand@@ ar@@ ine of the local person .
life had not changed since cent@@ u@@ ries for cent@@ u@@ ries .
her father died shor@@ tly after her birth .
her mother got her on their own .
at age 17 , she became the second woman of a mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother grab@@ bed her .
without their husband &apos;s support , she worried for a sen@@ sation by raising him in court , and he was in her own case , and a more greater touch than she won .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t come up as un@@ true . &quot;
i was just du@@ m@@ ney in a hotel room in sy@@ d@@ ney when she died , 1,000 miles away in mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
i looked through the cru@@ m@@ ra@@ l , and i saw them standing on the other side .
and i knew she had come from to say that she was
my mother would send me a few minutes after@@ ward .
a few days later , we walked into a budd@@ h@@ ist temp@@ le in kol@@ sc@@ ray and they were sitting around their sar@@ g .
and we told her stories , and we were worried that we were still with her .
so , at mid@@ night , the mon@@ k came and said he was going to end the sar@@ g .
my mother asked us to touch their hand .
and she asked the mon@@ k , &quot; why is your hand warm and the rest of her is so cold , and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they were holding them for this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t let them let them . &quot;
if there is a band in our family , it kee@@ ps through the women &apos;s office .
let &apos;s see who we were , and how life sha@@ ped us , we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives , would have come into the sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble .
the de@@ fe@@ ction would have been too simple .
now , i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i &apos;ll think about the boat .
who would ever want to be wearing one ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privi@@ lege , of course , about gender , in terms of gender .
can i give you a bu@@ g in your life , which is the fa@@ ve of every wave , the un@@ coun@@ ted , ever@@ ten@@ ners of the engine , the head@@ line that doesn &apos;t guar@@ an@@ tee any ?
and i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that , and i could certainly do it , i would do it .
and also , t@@ ans &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or the fif@@ th row .
i &apos;m here to share with you my photograph@@ y with them .
is it at all photograph@@ y at all ?
because this is , of course , a picture that you can &apos;t pick up with his camera .
and yet , my interest started in photograph@@ y when i got my first digital camera , at the age of 15 .
i combin@@ ed it with my former stat@@ ements for drawing , but it was a little different , because when the camera uses the camera , the process was in the planning of planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up with the process when you push it on the sc@@ or@@ es .
so for me , it seemed to be more about the photograph@@ y of being at the right time to be at the right time .
i felt anyone could be able to do that
so i wanted to create something else , something in which the process begins when the sc@@ ar@@ ri@@ c is being fol@@ ded .
pictures like this : a building site along a much wal@@ k@@ able road .
but it &apos;s got an un@@ expected twi@@ st .
and yet , there &apos;s a reali@@ stic level yet .
or pictures like this -- dark and color@@ ful at the same time , but all with the common obje@@ ctive to keep a reali@@ stic level .
when i say reality , i mean pain@@ t@@ asy .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really capture , but i just want to make it look like you can have it , on a photo .
photographs , where you have to think about a short moment , to find the trick .
so it &apos;s more about setting up an idea , as a really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it reali@@ stic to look at ?
so is it about the details , or the colors ?
is it all about the light ?
what creates the illusion that shapes ?
sometimes , the perspective is the illusion .
but after all , it &apos;s about how we interpre@@ t the world , and how it can be made on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s reali@@ stic , it &apos;s what we think is reali@@ stic .
so , i think , the bas@@ ences are very simple .
i &apos;m looking at them as a puzz@@ le of reality , where you can take different pieces and assem@@ ble together to create a different reality .
and let me show you a simple example of this .
we have three perfect imag@@ in@@ able objects that we can all identify with all of us in a three-@@ dimensional world .
but in a certain way , combin@@ ed together , they can create something that &apos;s still three dimensions , as if it might exi@@ gh .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we re@@ je@@ cted our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t just accept it , it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combin@@ ation of photos .
it &apos;s really just about com@@ plac@@ ating different reali@@ ties .
so the things that make a picture of reali@@ stic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our daily day .
if we com@@ bine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think of it , because otherwise you just look wrong somehow .
so i &apos;d like to say that there are three simple rules to occu@@ r to a reali@@ stic out@@ come .
and as you can see , these aren &apos;t three special pictures .
but you can com@@ bine something special like this , but you can create something special like this .
so the first rule is that combin@@ ation of the same perspective should have combin@@ ed the same
second should have combin@@ ed photographs of the same ligh@@ t@@ ings .
and these two pictures make these two requi@@ re@@ ments -- out of the same al@@ titude , and the same ligh@@ t@@ ning circu@@ it .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to make it possible where the individual pictures start and end by conne@@ cting them .
it makes it impossible to say how the photo actually has been put together .
so , by making color , contr@@ ast and fit@@ t@@ ness on the ed@@ ges , the photogra@@ phic lack of paint , the size of soli@@ tude , the size of soli@@ tude , separ@@ ated colors and dis@@ orders , we del@@ ay the boundar@@ ies between the different images , and let them look like a single photo , even though a picture of hundreds of levels can be con@@ stra@@ ined .
here &apos;s another example of this .
you might think that this is just a landscape of a landscape , and it &apos;s mani@@ pul@@ ated by the bottom part .
but this image is really completely inter@@ connected from photographs of different places .
personally , i personally , that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to engage com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed a couple months to plan them , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzz@@ les .
for example , the fish had been recor@@ ded on a cra@@ pp@@ y trip .
the bank comes from a different place .
the under@@ water part comes from a quar@@ t@@ ling .
and yes , i even color@@ ed the house on the red on red to make it look like swe@@ dis@@ h .
in order to achieve a reali@@ stic out@@ come , it &apos;s going to happen from me from planning .
i &apos;m always starting with a sc@@ et@@ p , an idea .
and after that , it &apos;s about the combin@@ ation of the various pictures .
and there &apos;s a very good piece of plan@@ c@@ tu@@ ation .
and if you make good foot@@ age , the result can be quite beautiful , and it &apos;s also quite reali@@ stic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that is em@@ power@@ ing us is our imagination .
thank you very much .
and i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electr@@ onic health projects er@@ ror .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced at the car@@ b@@ ou@@ d university was to make a prime listen@@ er .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific about this -- it makes a c@@ up of coffee or te@@ a and ask the patients , families , rela@@ tives , rela@@ tives , &quot; how is it on ?
how can we help them ? &quot;
and we think that we really want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everybody -- maybe just most of the electr@@ onic health projects , because we stopped listening to listen .
this is my dr@@ lan@@ -@@ flight . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a butt@@ on , it has a butt@@ on .
and every morning , i go on that .
and yeah , i &apos;ve got a task , as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve put my job at 95 po@@ gs .
it works very simple : every time i go down to the age , it &apos;ll send my data on google health .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re going to be there by my general physi@@ cian so that he can recognize where my weight problem is , and it &apos;s not just the moment where i need car@@ di@@ ological assi@@ stance or something , but i &apos;m looking at a gli@@ mp@@ se of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;ve known that , i &apos;ve got over 4@@ ,000 lines of voices on twitter .
so every morning i jum@@ ps on my pur@@ ple department , and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch just a little sal@@ ad today , lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
but this is the most expensive thing that can happen , because this is the farmers that are developed , group forced to help patients , because that might be used to be used for o@@ bes@@ ity , or it might be able to protect patients that smo@@ oth .
but it may also be used to get people out of their cha@@ irs , and to get them to play some kind of game in order to control their health .
at the end of the day , that &apos;s what happens to the market .
and there &apos;s going to be this little blood pressure that you &apos;re looking at to an iphone or something like this .
and it &apos;s going to en@@ able people to measure their blood pressure , send it to your physi@@ cian , send it to their physi@@ cian and share it with others , for a little more than 100 dollars .
at that point , patients come into play . they can &apos;t only take control , cap@@ tain on their own ship , but we can also be in their own books with the people who are in front of us , and the cost explosion of health , double demand , and so on .
do things that are easy to use , and start to hu@@ mili@@ ate patients in the team .
and you can do that through these sorts of ways , but also by crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done , i &apos;d like to share with you through a short video .
we have all the navi@@ ga@@ tion@@ -@@ based systems in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones , maybe .
we know very much where all the supp@@ lies of ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht are around ma@@ a@@ str@@ are .
we know another one where all the gas cli@@ ps are .
and yeah , we can find fast food cha@@ irs .
but where would the next a@@ ed would be to help this patient ?
we were asked around , and no one knew it .
nobody knew where to find the next li@@ fes@@ saving a@@ ed in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
we &apos;ve created a website and asked a human mass , &quot; if you see an a@@ ed , please share us where he is , when he gets up , &quot; and sometimes he &apos;s closed during the course of business during business , of course .
and over 10,000 a@@ e@@ ds have already been repor@@ ted in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
the next step was to find the app@@ s to do this .
and we designed an i@@ pa@@ d ap@@ p .
we &apos;ve developed an ap@@ p for la@@ y@@ ar , aug@@ mented reality to find these a@@ e@@ ds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like ma@@ a@@ stri@@ cht and someone , you can use your iphone , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , your micro@@ -@@ mobile phone can save the next a@@ ed that can save life .
and by now , we don &apos;t want to just do this as a@@ ed@@ 4@@ u , which is how the product calls , but also as a a@@ ed@@ 4@@ us , we do .
and we &apos;d like to get this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universi@@ ties , to help us be@@ have like the mis@@ k dots , to crow@@ d@@ source these a@@ e@@ ds all over the world .
and if you &apos;re in vac@@ ation and someone collap@@ ses , it &apos;s your relationship , or anyone else , you can find one of those , you can find that kind of a@@ ed .
the other thing , what we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us to con@@ fir@@ ti@@ ze this a@@ e@@ ds .
these might be p@@ ure services or techni@@ cians , for example , just to make sure that the harv@@ est@@ ed a@@ ed is still at its place .
please help us and try them to do the health not just a little bit better , but to take it to the hand .
thank you very much .
today , i &apos;m going to report about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
i work in solar technology &apos;s business .
and my little theme of star@@ tu@@ p is that we are going to conser@@ ve with it .
... it l@@ is@@ ds to crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
here &apos;s a short video about what we &apos;re doing .
oh . just a moment .
it may take it until it &apos;s going to be broken .
so , we can just jump through that -- i &apos;m going to just ski@@ p the video instead of just ski@@ p .
no , no .
that &apos;s not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time has been over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year out of time , and to work in a environment that is almost what they hate , we put them in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace shel@@ f for computer ge@@ e@@ ks .
we pick some fel@@ lo@@ ws every year , and we &apos;re doing it with urban admini@@ stra@@ tions every year .
so instead of sending them into the third world , we &apos;re going to send them in a tra@@ p .
and they developed great app@@ s working with urban employees working with urban collabor@@ ators .
but what they really do is to show what is possible today with technology .
so , they &apos;re going to come up .
al is a hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
this is what it looks like to be looking for a date , but what he really is looking for , is someone who is scrat@@ ching him when he knows , he knows it &apos;s not very good at the board when he knows it &apos;s not very good at a meter s@@ now when he &apos;s covered by a
how did he get to look at this particular way of looking for help ?
we had a team of bor@@ lo@@ ws last year last year in boston , the code for america .
they were there in febru@@ ary , and it &apos;s got a lot of ni@@ ghts in the febru@@ ary .
and they realized that the city would never s@@ hr@@ ink these hy@@ dr@@ ants .
but a particular fellow , a guy named er@@ ik prin@@ el@@ s-@@ hit@@ ger , realized something else , and that was that the resi@@ dents were breaking up the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks , right in front of those parts of them .
so he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
it &apos;s a nice little ap@@ p , where you can be adop@@ ted a hy@@ dr@@ ant of hy@@ dr@@ ant
you &apos;re true to it fre@@ ak@@ y when it &apos;s bus@@ ling .
if you &apos;re doing that , you can give him a name , and he called the first valley .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody else can take it away .
so , there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
so this is a hum@@ ble little ap@@ p .
it &apos;s probably the tin@@ i@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that the hol@@ lo@@ ws have written in the last year .
but it does something that no other govern@@ ance technology does .
it &apos;s rapi@@ dly exp@@ and@@ ing .
there &apos;s this guy in the i@@ .@@ t@@ . section of hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u , who saw that he could use this ap@@ p , not for s@@ now , but to adop@@ t the citi@@ zen , but to adop@@ t the citizens of tsun@@ ami
it &apos;s very important that these tsun@@ -@@ si@@ zed si@@ gs work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ ter@@ ies .
that &apos;s how he got the citizens to check them .
and then se@@ attle decided to use the ap@@ p to get the citizens to clean the dar@@ win@@ ed gul@@ l@@ ys .
and in chicago , she &apos;s just introduced , so people are scrat@@ ching the bu@@ ri@@ al sho@@ cks when it &apos;s bus@@ ling .
we now know about nine cities that plan to use this ap@@ p .
and it has spread fri@@ vol@@ ous , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know , it doesn &apos;t normally go like this .
the creation of software takes a few years of software .
we had a team that worked last year on a project last year , for the three people two and a half months .
it was about a method where the parents can find out what the real public schools are for their children .
we were later told that if it was going to go about the normal chan@@ n@@ els , it took it over two years , and it would have taken it over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not something that is not .
there &apos;s a project right now in the califor@@ ni@@ an justice , which is the tax@@ pa@@ yer used to have two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of the government .
so an ap@@ p , which is written in a couple of days , and then it spre@@ ads itself , is sort of a c@@ ran@@ l from the gul@@ f of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more as a private business , how many people think they should .
and not even like a tech business , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means zero access , which is open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly about that ap@@ p is that it represents a new generation that makes the problem of the government -- not as the problem of in@@ acc@@ essi@@ ble institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital engineering .
now there &apos;s a great community of people who are creating the tools that we need to put things effectively in a way .
it &apos;s not just code for america &apos;s fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country who write and write government app@@ s , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terri@@ bly fru@@ strated with her , but they &apos;re not com@@ pla@@ ining about it , they re@@ pair it .
and these guys know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the sna@@ kes of the work@@ force and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , is government , in core , in the words of tim o &apos;@@ rei@@ l@@ ly , &quot; what we do is , &quot; what we &apos;re doing is we can &apos;t do alone in the alone . &quot;
no@@ wa@@ days , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;ll ask you that you think you &apos;re thinking about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ultimately comple@@ ted their power from us -- remember to you , &quot; we are the people ? &quot; -- as we think about it , it &apos;s going to affect the way that change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started doing this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought that the government is main@@ ly about ele@@ cting people into a scho@@ ol@@ ar .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclu@@ sion that it &apos;s most of the commun@@ ori@@ ties to go with di@@ stan@@ di@@ ans .
this is the call center for the service and information .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re usually going out in your town 3@@ 11 .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scot@@ t sil@@ end@@ man , as part of the program -- in fact , do all of you -- are you going to see that the people who call the government for many different problems , including that there &apos;s a di@@ v@@ ant in your house , including that there &apos;s a di@@ v@@ ant in your house .
so scot@@ t gets to get this in@@ complete .
he ti@@ t@@ led &quot; sp@@ ri@@ es &quot; into the offi@@ ci@@ al dat@@ ab@@ ase .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s starting to start with the hol@@ der .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the do@@ ors in your house and play very bright music and see if the li@@ ve@@ stock is ab@@ pil@@ ing ? &quot;
and that worked . appl@@ t for scot@@ t .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the p@@ el@@ r@@ y@@ s .
in boston , it &apos;s not just a call center .
it has an ap@@ p , an internet and mobile ap@@ p , called the citi@@ zen fall@@ er .
and we didn &apos;t write that ap@@ p .
this is the work of very smart people at the office of the new urban mechan@@ ics in boston .
one day -- that &apos;s an actual report -- it came up , &quot; di@@ v@@ ens in my tr@@ ash . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get rid of it ? &quot;
but what &apos;s happened with &quot; citi@@ zen &quot; is different .
scot@@ t was talking about man to man .
but at a citi@@ zen , it &apos;s all publi@@ c@@ ly publi@@ c@@ ly publi@@ c@@ ly publi@@ c@@ ly , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it looked at a neighb@@ or@@ able .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , &quot; i went over there , i found the g@@ arb@@ age po@@ ll@@ s behind the house .
p@@ loo@@ d@@ rat ? yes . lifest@@ yle ? y@@ uns .
turned the tr@@ ash off the side . go home .
good night , swe@@ et ru@@ d@@ der . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is where digital is the physical one .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to get into the crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not really talking about a technical definition of the plat@@ forms here .
i &apos;m also talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
an citizens helped another citi@@ zen , but the government was playing a central role here .
and they put them together and these two people .
and you &apos;d have to connect them with government ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ers , if they were needed , but one neighb@@ or@@ able is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to the state services .
if one of the other motiv@@ ates helps the other thing helps , we streng@@ then our communities .
let &apos;s take a lot of money , and it costs a lot of money .
one of the key things is that we have to think about it , is that governments aren &apos;t the same as politics .
and most of the people understand this , but they think that one is the input of the other .
that our contribu@@ tions to the system is choo@@ sing .
how often did we ele@@ ct a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve consum@@ ed a lot of energy to vote a new political leader -- and then we re@@ move ourselves , and we just expect the government , and we expect our needs , and then hasn &apos;t changed a lot of changes ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a continu@@ ic ocean and politics that is the top 15@@ -@@ meter .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bu@@ ri@@ au@@ cra@@ ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ r .
and we use this word with this kind of con@@ temp@@ t .
but it is this sugge@@ sti@@ on that we own , and for which we pay , we get something that works against us , something different , and then we de@@ dic@@ ated ourselves .
people seem to think of , politics is sex@@ y .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to do bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy physi@@ c@@ us .
because this is where the actual government work is happening .
we need to rely on the machine agen@@ cy .
so py@@ py@@ thes@@ ec@@ i movement has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of people who wrote a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25 page report , which is an answer to the arts mem@@ o about law re@@ form , which is the essential re@@ form of
this is not poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy , that &apos;s bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ cy .
now , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time that we &apos;re thinking about the world that we &apos;re trying to leave our children .
you have to introdu@@ ce the enormous challenges that you have to ask .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to do without impro@@ ving the institution that &apos;s going to act in the name of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to become more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to make the function of the governments in a way that can actually achieve something that can actually achieve a difference by making society satis@@ fi@@ es .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up with the internet , and who knows it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the same thing in the same way .
now , the average age of our rock is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as a previous one .
they &apos;re not fighting the fight that we all struggle , about who &apos;s going to talk about , you all need to talk about them .
you can tell your opini@@ on , on every can@@ al at any time , and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re con@@ fron@@ ted with the problem of government , they don &apos;t worry so much about using your voices .
they &apos;re using your hands .
they use their hands to write appli@@ cations that improve the work of government .
and these app@@ s allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
this may be able to break up a hy@@ dr@@ ant , s@@ hr@@ inn@@ ing in@@ c@@ isi@@ ons , was@@ h a tr@@ ash with a p@@ el@@ sa@@ ve .
and sure , we would have to s@@ hr@@ ink these hy@@ dr@@ ants all the time , and lots of people do this .
but these ap@@ s are like little digital memor@@ ies that we &apos;re not only consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government who are paying ta@@ xes and re@@ plac@@ ing .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve government &apos;s civil citi@@ zen@@ ship .
so the question that i all have for all of you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , will we be just a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you very much .
normally , my role is to tell people how wonder@@ fully the new technologies that are on the rise are going to be on , and i thought , because i &apos;m here in my friends , i &apos;d tell you about what i really think i really do . and also trying to look back and understand what i really think is going on with these incredible jum@@ ps , which is so fast , that we can har@@ dly be able to be able to es@@ cape .
so i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single bor@@ ing slide for a moment .
... so , you &apos;d just show the slide for a moment .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve cho@@ sen from my cro@@ ve .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s about the general form of the slide .
this slide shows data from a visu@@ alization of ris@@ c process@@ ors compared to the power of ris@@ c process@@ ors with the power of a network of the network .
and what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like this , like this , that we often arri@@ ve in our field , is sort of a se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ve .
in other words , every step here is a poten@@ ce in the power of scale .
and that &apos;s a novel that we have to use this type of sc@@ ra@@ p on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ves in the area of technology .
something very strange here is happening here .
so this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could ask the light again , please .
there &apos;s another guy , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graph@@ s in the technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic cur@@ ra@@ z@@ ers ?
the reason for this is if i would draw it on a normal cur@@ ve , where , say , this is the years here , so the ti@@ mel@@ ine of a type , and this is a lack of mass of the technology that i want to put up with a graph , then the graph becomes sil@@ ent .
so here &apos;s what it looks like .
and that &apos;s not what a lot of us say .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a transpor@@ tation technology , it would be very ir@@ rational on the se@@ mi@@ -@@ log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic scale very ir@@ rational , in a flat line .
but if something like this happens , this changes the quality of qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative circum@@ stances .
so if the transpor@@ tation technology would continue as quickly as the micro@@ process@@ or technology would continue , then we could go into a tax@@ i , and in 30 seconds , we would be in to@@ k@@ yo .
but it &apos;s not so fast .
this has never been in the history of technology &apos;s history , this kind of rec@@ ur@@ sive growth , by which the size of the size of the size of the number of years is exp@@ and@@ ing exponenti@@ ally .
the question i &apos;m going to ask you now is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , you &apos;re not going to go , you &apos;re not going to go ahead forever
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going on forever and forever as fast as now as it is now .
now , there are two choices .
either it becomes a classi@@ c , a classi@@ c cur@@ ve , like here , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
now , i &apos;m an opti@@ m@@ ist , so i think that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen in the way that &apos;s going to happen .
it &apos;s really like that , then this means , we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a way from the round world to a new kind of world .
so the question that i &apos;d like to ask , and i often think of myself , is how this new world is going to be true ?
what is this new condition that makes the world going up slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very conf@@ essi@@ ble when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people were often talking about what would possibly happen in the year 2000 .
now , here we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
more than that , we &apos;re not going to go .
so in other words , the future of every year has dec@@ lin@@ ed by a year since i &apos;m in the world .
and i think the reason for this is that we realize that anything is going on .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make sense to try to look 30 or 50 years into the future , because it &apos;s going to be so different that there will be so different that a simple fra@@ ction of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
i want to talk about what this might be , this transition that we &apos;re now going to be right now .
to do that , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think in order to really understand this , we need to go back and look at what &apos;s going on on a longer period of time .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the time scale of life in the world .
i think the big picture makes sense if you divi@@ de it into a couple of billions of times .
so , let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s about 2.@@ 5 billion years , and the earth was a great , ster@@ i@@ le rock bul@@ p with lots of flo@@ ating chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture about how they made it .
i also believe there are theor@@ ies that are starting to understand how everything has started with r@@ na , but i &apos;m going to tell you a very simpli@@ stic story of what &apos;s going on at that time , that there &apos;s a lot of oil dri@@ pes that con@@ fir@@ ked different types of re@@ cep@@ tors for chemicals .
some of these oil dro@@ bs con@@ tain a special combin@@ ation of chemicals , which allowed them to integra@@ te other chemicals from outside and to grow to grow .
all of those were , they started to divi@@ de .
these little oil sp@@ ills were the most primi@@ tive cell@@ ular form .
but yet , these oil dro@@ bs were not about living in today &apos;s sense , because each one of them was just a small , random repres@@ cri@@ ption of chemicals .
and every time it divi@@ ded , the exi@@ sting chemicals were limited to entirely limited quanti@@ ties .
so each of the dri@@ ck@@ ens was a little different .
in fact , the dr@@ ills that would grow up to the growth of an opti@@ m@@ ant com@@ posite , and integr@@ ated more and more chemicals from it , and they divi@@ ded faster and more and more
so these tend to survive longer , and they spread in lar@@ gely propor@@ tion .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interest@@ ingly , it &apos;s going to be the case when these dro@@ pp@@ s learned a trick about abstra@@ ction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand yet , these fla@@ ws have been able to learn the ability to break information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the reci@@ pe of the cell as information , and it &apos;s in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found a way in this violent , evolution@@ al way that allowed them to re@@ write what they were saying , so that this information could be stor@@ ed and cop@@ i@@ ed .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is re@@ stor@@ ing information over the time of 2.@@ 5 billion years in which it was formed .
in fact , the reci@@ pe for us , is our genes , from the ex@@ act same code and the same scri@@ pt .
and that is every living uses the same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re so pre@@ cis@@ ely , in fact , to write in this code , even to write it in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 micro@@ gra@@ ms of a white pul@@ se that i try to hold in air@@ por@@ ts from security fe@@ atures .
this is what i &apos;ve done -- what i &apos;ve done , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is of normal letters that we &apos;re using to symbo@@ li@@ ze -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve em@@ pli@@ shed it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , i &apos;m going to have enough for anyone in this room and even for anyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in a real e@@ gos , then i would have written them on a virus and put them in the room .
so , what &apos;s the next step ?
the stat@@ ement of the dna was an interesting step .
and that made these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another very interesting , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s where these cells started to communicate and exchange information , so that communities came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you already knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
and that &apos;s why , for example , the in@@ conven@@ i@@ ence of antibio@@ tics are growing to antibio@@ tics .
some bacteria have figured out how to travel from pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and they &apos;ve written this information together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that resi@@ dents are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , because the bacteria communic@@ ates to each other .
now , this communication allowed the study of communities , which was , in a certain sense , was the same boat ; they were a sy@@ ner@@ agi@@ tic .
and so they were either survi@@ ved together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all individuals have been re@@ je@@ cted , and pre@@ fer@@ red by evolution , and pre@@ fer@@ red by evolution .
the transition scene is now , where these communities band@@ ed so close , that they decided to write the reci@@ pe for the entire community into a scri@@ p@@ ting chain .
and the next interesting series took about another billion years of time .
at that point , we &apos;ve got several satelli@@ te communities , communities of lots of different cell types that are acting together as a single organis@@ m .
in fact , we &apos;re also a multi-@@ bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of
we have a lot of cells that don &apos;t have any more on their own .
your skin cells are us@@ eless without heart cells , mus@@ cular cells , brain cells , and so on .
so these communities started evol@@ ving , so that the level that evolution was doing was no longer the single cell , but the whole cell community that we call the organis@@ m .
the next step was now happening within these communities .
the cell communities started abstra@@ cting information again .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t do anything else , as information as information in the organis@@ m .
and these are the neu@@ ral structures .
so these neurons are the information process of information process@@ ing that these cell forms have built .
they started educ@@ ating speci@@ alists within the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and doing the information of information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them a definition of evolution .
because at that point , it &apos;s a single individual -- learning now happened within the period of life of a single organis@@ m , rather than about this evolutionary period of time .
so one organis@@ m could learn , for example , not to eat a certain fru@@ it , because she lo@@ gh@@ ted and made it sick , the last time he ate her .
now , this has been able to happen within a single organis@@ m of a single organis@@ m , whereas , since hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be learned by the individuals who died because of these individuals , because these information process@@ ing structures have not been there yet .
so the nervous system has the engineering process with this particular information structures , because evolution has been able to occu@@ r within a single individual .
it was able to be done within a long-term learning frame@@ work .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms would find a way of communic@@ ating against each other .
so , for example , as an example , the most sophisti@@ cated thing of this communication is human language .
but it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i &apos;ve got a very complicated , un@@ com@@ pres@@ sed and conf@@ used idea in my head .
and i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically losing the gri@@ pp@@ y sound of myself , hop@@ ing to create a similar sort of en@@ ab@@ led idea in your head , which has a certain simil@@ ar@@ ity with my original idea .
so what we do is take something very complicated , turn it in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to do this as a uni@@ fied organis@@ m as well .
and what we &apos;ve actually done is , we , humanity , is , we &apos;ve started to abstra@@ ct .
we go through the same steps that have been through multiple cell organisms -- the abstra@@ ction of our metho@@ ds , how we put it together , to re@@ pair the data .
the invention of language , for example , was a little step in that direction .
tele@@ phones , computers , video , video ro@@ ms , and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechanis@@ ms that we built in our community to be able to have this information .
and it all conne@@ cts us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and it &apos;s very able to evol@@ ve faster than we &apos;ve been there before .
so no@@ wa@@ days , evolution can happen in the period of the world &apos;s time .
you &apos;ve seen t@@ 5 little evolution examples where he showed a little bit of evolution in the con@@ vol@@ di@@ um program , right about sight in front of sight .
so now , we &apos;re fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed again .
the first steps of history i told you , took a billion years per piece per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
then , the end steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electr@@ on@@ ics , seem to take a few decades ago .
the process is consum@@ ing itself , and it &apos;s going to , i think auto@@ -@@ cat@@ aly@@ tical is the word for it -- if something is rein@@ v@@ ented its change .
the more it changes , the further change it is .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at here in this explo@@ ren@@ tive cur@@ ve .
we see the process that fe@@ e@@ ds itself .
i happen to live from the building of computers , and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechan@@ ism that i use to build computers , not use without the modern advan@@ ces in computer technology .
my current work is to design objects with such a very complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense of the
i don &apos;t know what each one transi@@ st@@ or is doing in the assem@@ ble machine .
it &apos;s got billions of them .
what i do instead of , and what the designers of thinking is like , we think in a certain abstra@@ ction level , and we &apos;re going to give that the machine , and the machine makes it something that &apos;s far over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , better and faster than we can ever do it .
and it makes it par@@ tly with the metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t even understand yet .
and a method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve been using in the past time is evolution itself .
in this process , we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing a process of evolution in the machine , which is going on at the micro@@ graphic area .
to give you an example , in the most extreme , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from rand@@ om@@ ly in@@ struc@@ tions .
we say , &quot; computers , quanti@@ t@@ ly , &quot; a hundred million cases , sel@@ ec@@ ted sequences of in@@ struc@@ tions .
now , please do all of these rand@@ om@@ ly ele@@ cted in@@ struc@@ tions , accoun@@ ts all the program , and vote at the end of the end of my pres@@ ent@@ ations are the ones . &quot;
so in other words , i first do believe what i want to do .
let &apos;s say , i want to stre@@ tch numbers , that would be a simple example i &apos;ve used for it .
so , some of the programs are the ones that are the most popular numbers .
now , of course , the chance of rand@@ om@@ ly ele@@ cted in@@ struc@@ tions are very small , that it &apos;s just numbers , so that it &apos;s not going to be the in@@ struc@@ tions to do this .
but one of them may be very lucky with a little bit of lu@@ ck@@ ens in the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the world that i &apos;ve come up with the next 10 percent of the species that i &apos;ve come up with .
store that off , disappe@@ at@@ ter@@ ing the rest .
now , all the rema@@ ins are em@@ powered all the rema@@ ins that are doing the numbers best .
and it is with a method of re@@ combin@@ ative , anal@@ o@@ g for re@@ production . &quot;
take two programs , and they make kids through the exchange of their su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es , and the kids bur@@ st the fe@@ atures of the su@@ br@@ ou@@ tin@@ es from the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through combin@@ ations of programs that have come a little closer to the expen@@ se than others .
say , &quot; please repe@@ ee@@ ze this process . &quot;
and again , they dec@@ lin@@ ed .
and there may be some mu@@ tations to do .
and try to try and try to do this with another generation .
all of these generations , just a few milli@@ seconds , are requi@@ red .
and so i can run a democracy over millions of years in the computer within a few minutes , or in more complicated cases , in a couple of more complicated cases .
and finally , i &apos;m going to be able to program the numbers that are perfectly visible .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i ever could have written by hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve been trying to understand them .
it &apos;s more mana@@ ge@@ able and weird programs .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
i know , and i &apos;m very sure that you &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of tens of thousands of programs that have done the job done .
because your life depen@@ ds on whether they did the job proper@@ ly .
i sat in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 once in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 , with mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky , bor@@ ing a map , and he says , &quot; oh look , look at this .
it says , &quot; this plane is made out of hundreds of thousands of little pieces that work together to make your flight sa@@ fer , &quot; don &apos;t you worry about that ? &quot;
we know that a process of development is not opti@@ mal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to leave on computers , for a process , which is very different from classi@@ cal engineering terms .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal metho@@ ds would be allowed to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the possibility of that yet .
so , in a sense , the technology shif@@ ts us .
so we &apos;re using these programs to make the computer a lot faster , so that we can be able to do these processes faster .
so there &apos;s a feedback of feedback .
it gets faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems to be so conf@@ used .
because all of these new technologies are fe@@ eding itself from themselves .
we &apos;re pul@@ ling off .
we &apos;ve enter@@ ed at a point , the anal@@ o@@ g is at the time when there &apos;s a multi-@@ cell organisms developed to hundreds of cell organisms .
so we &apos;re the am@@ ga@@ s , and we can &apos;t really do very much what the hell we &apos;re doing here is to actually design .
we &apos;re in the middle of that transition .
but i really believe that we &apos;ll be doing something else .
i find it very cru@@ m@@ bled from us that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think all of us here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , the lunch is before , and i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m going to stop here before i &apos;m going to cho@@ se .
my story starts right here in ra@@ j@@ as@@ than here , about two years ago .
i was in the desert sky in the desert sky with su@@ fi@@ -@@ sing@@ er mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar al@@ i .
we talked about nothing that has changed from the time of the ancient indian gy@@ po@@ s of ma@@ hab@@ har@@ at@@ a . &quot;
if we wanted to travel in indian , we &apos;d clim@@ b into a car and sho@@ ot@@ ed over the sky .
now , let &apos;s do this with air@@ planes .
at the time , as the great indian war@@ ri@@ a prin@@ ce had te@@ ff fin@@ ch , he took a bo@@ w , shot in the floor and water .
now , let &apos;s do this with dri@@ ll@@ ers and machines .
and we conclu@@ ded to the conclu@@ sion that magic and magic were re@@ placed by machines .
and that made me really sad .
i got a little fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing of technology .
it made me fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun@@ way without a camera , and without t@@ we@@ et to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill it .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver ta@@ d@@ do@@ ck .
this piece of 5@@ 0-@@ year-old technology became the most ma@@ gical thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world full of pir@@ ates and trou@@ bled ships and to pictures in my imagination .
i was so pre@@ ten@@ ding to think of our brea@@ ks and c@@ ameras off the way we were doing .
they were really inspired to be inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to en@@ able magic rather than kill ma@@ gical .
with 16 , i started to illu@@ strate books .
when i saw the i@@ pad , i saw it as a device for story@@ telling that would connect the re@@ a@@ ders around the world .
we can know how we think it is .
it can know where we are .
and it puts images and text together , and anima@@ tion , sounds and touch .
the story@@ telling always needs more senses .
so , what do we do with that ?
i &apos;m just going to k@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active i@@ pad ap@@ p .
and here &apos;s , &quot; take your fing@@ ers on every light . &quot;
and so here -- &quot; this box is saying , &quot; this box , &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to give a character in the book .
once again , a letter is going down for me -- and the i@@ pad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me , in me , is really excited of that .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean the ma@@ ers and dra@@ es , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
in a glass of drin@@ bs , i was always going to find a great deal .
that &apos;s how you have to sna@@ p the i@@ pad , and leave the fire@@ bul@@ bs out here .
and the ligh@@ t@@ ning way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascin@@ ated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be put in a single mur@@ m@@ um .
and so here &apos;s why every book is going to be , and each world , a little fren@@ b that i &apos;m going to give you is the ma@@ gical machine in the device .
and this op@@ ens up a map .
the fan@@ tas@@ y@@ books had always had maps , but these maps were sta@@ tic .
this map gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and accoun@@ t@@ ated in the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also poin@@ ting on other forms of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that is indian , but it &apos;s also very time .
so these are the ap@@ sar@@ as .
we &apos;ve all heard of fe@@ es and n@@ y@@ mp@@ es , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the ap@@ sar@@ as ?
the poor ap@@ sar@@ as were caught up thousands of years in in@@ dr@@ as , in an old mu@@ ff@@ able book .
and we bring them back , in a con@@ temporary story for children .
it &apos;s a story which is refer@@ ring to new issues like the environmental crisis .
for the environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their shoul@@ ders , they &apos;re sitting on their computers without jum@@ ping out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
so in a way of a book , you &apos;re going to send up a search , and you &apos;ve got to go out and do it with the camera of the i@@ pa@@ d &apos;s image of natural objects .
as a kid , i had colle@@ ctions of sti@@ ck@@ ens , kni@@ fe , sha@@ ke and bra@@ ke .
somehow , the children don &apos;t do anymore .
this chil@@ ness will get back . you have to go out to be a chap@@ ter a photo of a flo@@ wer , and to mark it .
in another chap@@ ter , you have to photograph a piece of tun@@ a in another chap@@ ter and tag .
this is how you actually create a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you can then bring online .
a kid in london shows the picture of an ear and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a steel . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a mon@@ key . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital colle@@ ction of photographs that you &apos;ve actually recor@@ ded .
there &apos;s a whole variety of opportunities about magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning to design a interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the i@@ pa@@ d , and through aug@@ mented reality , an anima@@ tion of el@@ ches that appear on a plant in front of the house .
one of them pul@@ ls the screen with leaves with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the win@@ ds , send them off and read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re all going to move on a world where the nature of technology can get closer and in magic and technology can be resol@@ ved .
we &apos;re using the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world , and to the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you very much .
this is really an exc@@ ell@@ ent honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , pris@@ ons or dea@@ ths or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the so@@ cially we@@ ak@@ est in the social facili@@ ties and in places where there &apos;s a lot of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness in the social institutions .
now , to be here at ted , and listening to how stimul@@ ated this is , it gave me a lot of force .
and in the short time here , i got a clear thing : ted has a identity .
and you can say things that have influence of the world .
and sometimes if something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and the strength that doesn &apos;t otherwise have it .
and i say that because i believe that identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some magni@@ fi@@ cent pres@@ ent@@ ations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher has meaning , but that &apos;s especially the words of a commit@@ ted teacher , especially meaning@@ ful
as a doctor , you can do good . as a physi@@ cian , but you can do more and more .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t have learned this in my work as a law@@ yer .
i &apos;ve learned this from my grandmother .
i was a big in a family , a traditional african hou@@ se@@ hold , who was domin@@ ated by a matri@@ key , and this matri@@ ch@@ in was my grandmother .
she was a pi@@ ll@@ ering , strong woman , she had influence .
she had the last word in any family argument .
it was also the focus point of a lot of ri@@ vers in our family .
she was the daughter of a sla@@ ve family .
they were born in virg@@ ini@@ a in virg@@ ini@@ a as sla@@ ves in the 18@@ 4@@ 0s .
it was born by 18@@ 80 , and the experience of sla@@ very sha@@ ped her world@@ view very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but it was also hu@@ mili@@ ate .
and when i met her as a little kid , she came up and hu@@ g@@ ged me .
and she made me feel that i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the , and then she &apos;d let me go .
and one or two hours later , when i showed her , she came up to me and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , do you feel my hu@@ mili@@ ate ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; they hu@@ g@@ bled me again , and i said , &quot; yes , let &apos;s go , let me go down .
her was something that made you , that you would always want to be near her .
the only problem with this was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the yo@@ un@@ gest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cou@@ s@@ ins are around all over the world .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i wo@@ ke up one morning and i went to the living room , and all my cou@@ s@@ ins are lying around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room , and star@@ ing me up .
first , i thought this would be a game .
and i looked at her and i s@@ mil@@ ed , but she looked very seriously .
this went so about 15 or 20 minutes . and then she came up and came to me . she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come on , br@@ y@@ an . you and me , we have to talk . &quot;
and i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going to forget .
and she took me out and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you &apos;re not going to say it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promis@@ ed , om@@ a . &quot;
and she said , &quot; i said , &quot; hon@@ ey ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and they sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i looked at you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re doing something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to say three things , br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
and i said , &quot; ok , gran@@ a . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m just suggest@@ ing that you &apos;re going to love your mom forever . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise with promise that you &apos;re going to care about them . &quot;
and i told my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grand@@ ma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; the next thing that i would make is that you &apos;re going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
and i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , om@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to tell me is , &quot; that you &apos;ll never drink al@@ co@@ hol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , om@@ a . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , in the old south south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year yo@@ unger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this na@@ dow be@@ er with my sister , my sister and i walked to the wo@@ ods .
and we were just ali@@ ying around the same way as well .
and he took a s@@ lu@@ ak be@@ er and he gave my sister &apos;s sister , and she took me , and then she took me to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . do you . don &apos;t do it . i don &apos;t want a be@@ er . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , go on . now we &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had what , your sister had something . go , drin@@ k a be@@ er . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . you just don &apos;t want to do it .
my brother star@@ et@@ led me .
he said , &quot; well , what &apos;s wrong with you ? now drin@@ k . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh , no , you &apos;re not going to do any crazy because of the conversation with gran@@ a ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; grand@@ ma tells me that they are special . &quot;
i was de@@ va@@ st@@ ated on the floor .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of them .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
and this may be trans@@ mit@@ ted by public education .
i &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never dr@@ us@@ hed a drop of al@@ co@@ hol .
i &apos;m not saying that , because i think it &apos;s virtu@@ ous . i &apos;m saying that because identity means power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us things that they don &apos;t believe at first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t do it .
of course , my grand@@ children would tell all your grand@@ cles , she &apos;s something special .
my grand@@ father was during the ma@@ yo@@ bi@@ on in prison .
my un@@ cle died on al@@ co@@ hol in@@ struc@@ ted disease .
and she believed that this would be the top@@ ics that we had to take care of .
i &apos;ve tried to tell a little bit about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 197@@ 2 , 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people were in sla@@ ve and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.@@ 3 million .
the united states now have the highest indian rate in the world today .
seven million people have been traff@@ i@@ cked , or with condi@@ tional crimin@@ al justice .
in my opini@@ on , mass in@@ sur@@ si@@ ties have fundament@@ ally changed our world .
in so@@ cially we@@ ak and black share of the population , ma@@ am des@@ pair and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , because of that change .
one out of three pounds of black black between 18 and 30 is in clear , in prison , in prison , or with condi@@ tional justice .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles , about phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , bal@@ ti@@ more to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black boys either in prison , killed on prison , on prison , or with condi@@ tional justice .
our system is not just cont@@ all@@ ed by questions that have to do with ra@@ om@@ ers , and it &apos;s also de@@ dic@@ ated by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that makes you a lot better if they &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty as poor and inno@@ cent .
wealth , not de@@ bt , affec@@ ts the result .
still , we seem to be very comfortable with it .
a politics of fear and an@@ ger has convinced us that these problems aren &apos;t our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact of it .
and i find that interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of very interesting develop@@ ments .
my home state of al@@ ab@@ ama is perman@@ ently acc@@ essi@@ ble to them , when they &apos;re pun@@ ely con@@ vi@@ cted of it .
here , in al@@ ab@@ ama today , 3@@ 4 percent of the male black population has perman@@ ently lost their ele@@ ction .
we &apos;re proje@@ cting that in 10 years the age recogni@@ tion of civil rights is going to be so high as before the ele@@ ction of the vote law .
sil@@ ence is o@@ dor@@ an@@ cing .
i &apos;m teaching kids .
a lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
the united states of the united states are the only country in the world that are consi@@ stent three / year-old children to prison in prison .
in this country in our country , there are a life@@ -@@ time for children without a limited cause of justice
and we &apos;ve already run a lot of proce@@ dur@@ ation .
the only country in the world .
i hi@@ re people in the death cells .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty &apos;s question is an interesting question .
we believe that you &apos;ve taught it that the real question is that the real question is : has a man deser@@ ved to die for you to die for cri@@ mes ?
and that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not one : somebody deser@@ ves for a crime , but is , did we deser@@ ve to kill ?
and i find that fascinating .
the death pen@@ al@@ ty in america is defined by er@@ ror .
at nine people that we &apos;ve ex@@ ecu@@ ted , one that we &apos;ve done is one that we agre@@ ed to be inno@@ cent and thro@@ wn out of the death cell .
an amazing er@@ ror , one of nine un@@ gu@@ il@@ ty .
and i find that fascinating .
we &apos;d never let anyone fly with an airplane if there was nine planes going off , turn one off of it .
but somehow , we can elimin@@ ate ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race , and the question of whether we &apos;re having the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;m teaching my yo@@ ung@@ sters of alex@@ can@@ an-@@ american history . i &apos;m talking about sla@@ very .
i &apos;m talking about ter@@ ror , which is time at the end of the re@@ construction , until the third world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the afri@@ can@@ as in this country , it was a time of ter@@ ror .
in many areas , people had to be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of ly@@ n@@ ch@@ mo@@ bs .
or bom@@ b bom@@ bs .
it was the fear of ter@@ ror that was sha@@ ped her life .
these el@@ der@@ ly people are coming up to me and say , &quot; m@@ r , ste@@ ven@@ son , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re concerned , they &apos;re going to stop saying , we have to stop doing this for the first time in our nation &apos;s history with terror@@ ism , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terror@@ ism , of course , the roman@@ tur@@ or@@ ship , and decades , the rapi@@ dly motiv@@ ated and a@@ par@@ thei@@ d was motiv@@ ated and a@@ par@@
and yet , in our country , we have a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and so we really don &apos;t really understand what the importance of our actions have in the histor@@ ical context .
we &apos;re always be@@ aring up .
we &apos;re always creating new ten@@ sion and confli@@ cts .
we &apos;re really hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach ourselves the process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
in south africa , people have understood that the scri@@ re@@ ment doesn &apos;t over@@ come , without the will@@ ing@@ ness to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
even after the geno@@ cide of r@@ wand@@ a , there were this will@@ ing@@ ness , but not in that of our country .
i &apos;ve enter@@ ed some discus@@ ses in germany on the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s very , very dis@@ mis@@ sed to hear them talking like this . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death pen@@ al@@ ty .
and of course , they can never give them more in germany . &quot;
it became very sil@@ ent . and then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we only talk about syste@@ matic kill@@ s of people .
it would be more responsible from us , consci@@ ously , to engage people , consci@@ ously . &quot;
and i was thinking about it .
as it would feel like to live in a world where the ger@@ man state had people come up , especially if there were a lot of je@@ ors , a lot of je@@ ors .
it would be in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent .
it would be consi@@ der@@ able .
and yet , here in this country , in the world of the ancient south , we &apos;re doing people -- here &apos;s the risk of being con@@ vi@@ cted to death , 11 times higher , when the vic@@ tim is white than when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , when the war is black and the vic@@ ti@@ ms -- in the same states , in which the body ro@@ cks the blind people are ar@@ ro@@ sting .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental re@@ co@@ very .
i think that our identity is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult subje@@ cts , then the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation , too .
and we love technology and creativity .
so we love entertain@@ ment .
but at the end of all , these reali@@ ties are over@@ lin@@ ed by suffering , ab@@ use , in terms of circum@@ stance .
i think it &apos;s important to ins@@ ert both of them .
because we &apos;re starting to end on that we need more hope , more entertain@@ ment , more commit@@ ment , to be able to be able to be able to be able to influence a complex world .
for me , the time is going to be thinking and talking about the poor , the per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , the one that never will be at ted .
but think in a way that is integr@@ ated in our lives .
we all need to believe that we have to believe that we can &apos;t .
we do that . we also are so relevant , so much as we make sense of it .
innovation , creativity , and development , and development is not just coming from our minds .
they come from ideas that are driven by the con@@ vi@@ ction in our he@@ arts .
it &apos;s this head@@ -@@ heart connection , which i think is driving us not only to be open for all the bad and fun things , but also for the dark and won@@ mate .
so , vac@@ la@@ v ha@@ ys , the great ca@@ p politi@@ cian , once said .
&quot; when we were strug@@ gling in eastern europe against the op@@ pres@@ sion , we wanted to do everything . but what we needed most needed was hope , a mental ori@@ entation , the will@@ ing@@ ness , sometimes to be hop@@ e@@ ful places , and to be wit@@ n@@ essed . &quot;
this mental ori@@ entation is the core of what i believe is that the ted communities also have to engage for it .
there is no limit@@ ation of technology and design that allows us to be human and human@@ ly human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and e@@ ars for poverty , recogni@@ ti@@ fication and in@@ justice .
i &apos;d like to war@@ n you . this kind of identity is a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t have to do about it .
it &apos;s going to be deeply tou@@ ching them .
when i was a young law@@ yer , i would have the great privi@@ lege of meeting ro@@ sa par@@ ks .
woman par@@ ks came back to mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery , where she was tra@@ il@@ ing two of her ol@@ dest friends tra@@ f@@ ted . these el@@ der@@ ly women , john@@ nie car@@ r , who organized the mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ er@@ y bus bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t -- an un@@ belie@@ vable african woman -- and virg@@ ini@@ a dur@@ r , a white , cli@@ ff@@ ord woman , dr. king inv@@ et@@ en .
so these women were doing , and they were just following themselves .
and i came up and said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , and he said , &quot; br@@ y@@ an , wife par@@ ks comes to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come up and listen and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very much like . &quot;
and she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just listen@@ ed .
it was always so in@@ spir@@ ing , so it was so un@@ in@@ spir@@ ing .
and one day i sat there and listen@@ ed to these women , and after a couple of hours , my par@@ ks turned to me and said , &quot; well , br@@ y@@ an , tell me what &apos;s right for the same thing . &quot;
what &apos;s going to try to do ? &quot;
so , i started with my regular talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to pre@@ fer against in@@ justice . &quot;
w@@ r , people want to help people who have been inno@@ cent .
we want to fight the bi@@ ph@@ as and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the crimin@@ al system .
we want to get life@@ -@@ lived rights without a limited cause of law for children .
we want to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty companies .
we want to reduce the number of extin@@ ct people .
we want to create mass in@@ sur@@ si@@ ties . &quot;
and i gave my usual lec@@ ture , and then she looked at me and he said , &quot; e@@ h@@ mm . m@@ h@@ mm . hu@@ h . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to make you very , very ti@@ red . &quot;
and then ham@@ w woman came up to me , put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and therefore you have to be very , very bra@@ ve . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be che@@ e@@ ger@@ ers .
we need to find ways of finding this challenges : these problems , this we@@ ak@@ ness .
because ultimately , our humanity depen@@ ds upon us , from all of us .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned a very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of simple things .
that we are all more than the worst we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every people on the planet .
when someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a li@@ ar .
if someone is taking something that doesn &apos;t even bel@@ ong to him , it &apos;s not just a ru@@ ve .
even who kill@@ s someone , is not just a mur@@ derer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dig@@ ni@@ ty that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in a lot of parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think this is .
i think there &apos;s too many places that i believe is the opposite of poverty justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dra@@ matic , so beautiful and in@@ spir@@ ing , and so in@@ spir@@ ing , we &apos;re not going to be measu@@ red about our technology , not about the things we develop , not in our intelle@@ ct and minds .
and finally , a society is not measu@@ red from how they treat their rich and powerful and privi@@ le@@ ged , but by the way they surro@@ unded with the poor , the in@@ consi@@ sten@@ ted , the ones that are in@@ formed .
because in this context , we &apos;re starting to understand the truly amazing things that are doing us .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um . a story for the end .
sometimes i &apos;m going to push too much .
i &apos;m going to ti@@ red of all of us .
sometimes these ideas bur@@ ys our thinking , in a very important way of thinking .
i &apos;ve been following these kids who have been con@@ vi@@ cted to very hard sent@@ ences .
i go to the research prison and visit a cam@@ ent who may be 13 or 14 years old , and who should stand as a adult person to be kid@@ na@@ pped .
and then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a ju@@ dge turn someone into something that it isn &apos;t ?
the ju@@ dge looks at him as an adult , but i see a child .
and one night i was sitting too long , and i thought , god , if a ju@@ dge can turn us into something else , then he has to have magic power@@ s .
right , br@@ y@@ an , the jud@@ ges have ma@@ ma@@ fi@@ ce forces .
you should have done whatever you wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think of it , i started working on a contra@@ ct .
i had a nin@@ e-@@ year-old , poor black boy as a fi@@ fel@@ ar .
and i started with this sugge@@ sti@@ on . the head@@ line said , &quot; an@@ ch@@ ening , my arms , 14@@ -year-old black ger@@ ler , like a privi@@ le@@ ged to treat white , 7@@ 5@@ -year-old mes@@ man@@ gers . &quot;
and in my as@@ sign@@ ment , i expla@@ ined that mis@@ behavior of the state agen@@ cy and the police and admini@@ h would be bal@@ an@@ ced .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more about this , that there &apos;s only fal@@ se behavior .
the next morning i wo@@ ke up , and i didn &apos;t even know if i was just dre@@ aming this crazy argument or actually had written him .
and to my ex@@ pos@@ ure , i didn &apos;t just write him , but i was sent to the court .
a couple of months went over , and i just for@@ gotten everything .
and finally , i decided , &quot; my god , i have to go to the cour@@ ts and give this crazy case .
i got in the car , and i was really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
so , i went to the court .
and i thought , it &apos;s going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
and finally , i went out of my car , and i went up the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court .
when i was the sta@@ ir@@ case to the court , there was an el@@ der@@ ly black man , a black man , the jan@@ it@@ ors in the court .
and when he saw me , he came up to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and hu@@ mili@@ ate me .
and then he wh@@ is@@ bled me in the ear .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , &quot; i &apos;ve got power . &quot;
it tou@@ ched something very deep in me , identity , the ability to contribu@@ te to a community , to a public perspective , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
as soon as the ju@@ dge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. ste@@ ven@@ son , did you put this crazy paper ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discus@@ sing .
more and more people came in , just because they were an@@ gry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police off@@ ic@@ ers came in and negoti@@ ated government agen@@ cies and off@@ ered office .
in the pal@@ m room , the cour@@ pr@@ room was full of people who were an@@ gry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about ine@@ quality .
from my eye , i saw the jan@@ it@@ ors go up and go off .
he kept looking at the window over the window , and she was able to hear all the to@@ hu@@ w@@ ot@@ h@@ u .
and he went up and down .
after all , this el@@ der@@ ly black man came up with a very concerned face in the cour@@ thou@@ se , and he sat straight behind me , almost on the defen@@ se bank .
ten minutes later , the jud@@ ges picked up a break .
and during the break , a police leader came in , and he felt that the jan@@ it@@ ors was in the cour@@ t@@ room .
this de@@ pu@@ ty ran@@ ked over to the old black black .
he said , &quot; j@@ im@@ my , what do you do in the cour@@ t room ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the de@@ pu@@ ty , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i got there to tell this young man , don &apos;t lose the dest@@ ination out of the eyes . don &apos;t give up . &quot;
and i came to the ted , because i think a lot of you have understood that the moral pen@@ le of the universe is going on , but it &apos;s acc@@ essi@@ ble to justice .
that we as humans are completely evolved , as long as we don &apos;t have about human rights and basic values .
that all of us survive with survival every single one of us is connected .
that we have to connect our visi@@ ons of technology and design , of entertain@@ ment and creativity with humanity with humanity , p@@ ity and justice .
and most of all , i &apos;d like to see all of you , just say , don &apos;t lose the end out of your eyes . don &apos;t give up the end .
you &apos;ve seen in this crowd , this community , that community has seen a very obvious wish , and we &apos;ve heard to help them and do something .
what can we do about that ?
br@@ y@@ an ste@@ ven@@ son : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you &apos;re living in california , there &apos;s a great decision in this spring , where it &apos;s actually a great decision to do something from the money that &apos;s going to flow into the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment , which is otherwise flo@@ wing into the politics of
here , in california , for example , in california , you &apos;re going to be a billion dollars for death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years , a billion dollars .
and yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all the ob@@ pa@@ il@@ ers don &apos;t end up with a dec@@ lin@@ ing .
in fact , 5@@ 6 percent of all the time lap@@ se cases are not in trial .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this re@@ venue is suggest@@ ing that the money is going to invest in more security skills and security .
and i think there are opportunities everywhere .
over the last three decades , the rate rate in america has dec@@ lin@@ ed enor@@ m@@ ously .
this fact is often being asked in a propor@@ tion with the increas@@ ed in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation .
what would you say to someone who belie@@ ves this ?
well , in fact , the number of crimin@@ al crimin@@ als have not changed very much .
most of the mass in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cies in this country didn &apos;t really occu@@ r in the class of violent crimin@@ als .
it was the missing drop of drugs for drugs .
that &apos;s why the dra@@ matic high numbers come from the pris@@ on@@ ories .
we pil@@ gl@@ ed ourselves from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
now , we &apos;ve got three ver@@ k@@ are laws that allow people forever forever , for a bi@@ cycle call , for a bi@@ cycle , for the the@@ ft of cheap good , instead of com@@ pla@@ ining them to give the things to sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce the things .
i think we have to do more to help people who have become vic@@ ti@@ ms of a crimin@@ al , not less .
and i think that we don &apos;t help anybody &apos;s philosoph@@ y &apos;s philosoph@@ y .
and i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
so br@@ y@@ an , you really have a string to s@@ hr@@ ink a string .
they &apos;re an in@@ spir@@ ing person@@ ality .
thank you for ted , thank you very much . thank you .
it &apos;s a bur@@ den of death , it &apos;s a re@@ duced driver &apos;s risk with it .
ger@@ es : fam@@ ine in som@@ alia . speak@@ er : p@@ .@@ c. spra@@ y the police .
speak@@ er : bad kar@@ tel@@ les . speak@@ or : danger@@ ous cru@@ f ves@@ sel@@ s .
pr@@ 6 : social dec@@ line . speak@@ er : 65 dea@@ ths .
repor@@ ts 8 : tsun@@ am@@ i@@ ri@@ zation : cyber@@ -@@ attack : cyber@@ -@@ attack
different speak@@ ers : drug war . weapons of mass destruction . tor@@ na@@ do .
rec@@ ession . mo@@ om . do@@ om . eg@@ y@@ pt . sy@@ ri@@ a . sy@@ ri@@ a .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh , my go@@ sh .
so these are just some of the cli@@ ps that i &apos;ve colle@@ cted over the last six months -- it would have been the last six days , but it can have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is , the media pre@@ fer@@ ences to show us negative subje@@ cts , because our minds are just giving attention to this top@@ ics .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second , every day , our sense of view , our sense of information can begin to process a lot more information than our brain can ever process .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , the first thing for all the information is a part of our tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ be , which is the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
so the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our modern war@@ ning system , our cre@@ ature dete@@ ctor .
it fig@@ ures , and it goes through all the information looking for all of us in our surro@@ und@@ ings in our surro@@ und@@ ings .
so if we can see the news , we pre@@ fer to look for negative news .
and the old ada@@ ge , when it &apos;s flo@@ wing , the demand is ris@@ ing , is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices that are seven days a week , 24 hours a day , all these negative mes@@ sages , it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that we &apos;re p@@ essi@@ mi@@ stic .
it &apos;s not a mira@@ cle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but it may not be the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps , the tremendous progress , which we &apos;ve made in the last century through a series of forces , are so strong that it will be possible for us in the next three decades to create a world of over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming a world of over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , alzheimer &apos;s disease , animals and energy problems -- we &apos;ve already got it .
and as humans , we are much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but gradu@@ ally , they end up over@@ ward .
so let &apos;s take a look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century so that we can anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te the development of development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expec@@ tan@@ cy has increas@@ ed more than dou@@ bled , which has been tri@@ pl@@ ed to the inf@@ lation of average income in the world population .
child mortality has increas@@ ed by a tent@@ h of a tent@@ h .
and the thing is that food , electricity transpor@@ tation and communic@@ ation costs have de@@ ple@@ ted a lot of a lot .
steve pin@@ ker has shown us that we &apos;re living in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful time of human history right now .
and charles ken@@ ny , according to charles ken@@ ny , has been 25 percent to 80 percent of the last 1@@ 30 years .
we &apos;re living in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget about that .
and we &apos;re exp@@ and@@ ing our expec@@ tations constantly .
in fact , we &apos;ve re@@ defined poverty .
consider that a great propor@@ tion of americans living under poverty , access to electricity , water , toi@@ lets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , telev@@ isi@@ ons , mobile phones , air condi@@ tion@@ ing and cars .
the rich@@ est capit@@ alists of the last century , the im@@ per@@ ators of the earth , could never have dre@@ am@@ ed of such lux@@ ury goods .
the basis for a lot of these forms are integr@@ ating technologies , and they &apos;re growing ex@@ pli@@ c@@ it@@ ly .
my good friend ray kurz@@ weil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to be information technology , on the cur@@ ve of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , and the price performance qu@@ o@@ ti@@ ents dou@@ bled all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s what the cell@@ phone costs in your bag about a million times less than a million times less than a super@@ computer from the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
now take a look at this cur@@ ve .
this is mo@@ ore &apos;s law &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
watch two things on this cur@@ ve .
the first is how smo@@ king it down -- in good times , war , or peace , rec@@ ession , depression , rec@@ ession , depression and high-@@ cycle cycle .
so this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
and it slo@@ ws down for any of our big problems .
fur@@ ther@@ more , despite their log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic rema@@ ins on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , it &apos;s up@@ ward .
the growth rate is spee@@ ding up .
and on this cur@@ ve , on the back of mo@@ ore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of us .
&quot; clou@@ d-@@ computing , &quot; something that my friends at auto@@ des@@ k &apos;s &quot; addi@@ ction compu@@ tation , &quot; sensor@@ s and networks , 3d prin@@ ters , robots , 3d prin@@ ter , which allow it to democra@@ ti@@ ze the personal production on our planet , syn@@ thetic biology , fuel , technology medicine , nan@@ o-@@ intelligence and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the vic@@ tory of ib@@ m super@@ computer &apos;s super@@ computer on &quot; risk . &quot;
that was gran@@ di@@ os , though .
i &apos;ve swi@@ t@@ ched the new@@ spa@@ pers and looking for the best head@@ lines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; wat@@ son refer@@ uses human sig@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s all about understanding the nu@@ cle@@ ance of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence players are provi@@ ding each other &apos;s ow@@ ner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , mark kurz@@ weil , and i was here at ted , a new university called sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity university .
we bring our students all of these technologies , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create companies , companies and services that can be positive in a decade positive life , in a decade of billions of people .
think about that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people today .
30 years ago , this would have been ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
today , we can dete@@ ct on do@@ zens of companies that have made exactly this .
when i &apos;m thinking about creating over@@ flow , i don &apos;t mean a life full of lux@@ ury for everyone on this planet ; i &apos;m about to create a life of opportunity .
it &apos;s about creating sc@@ ar@@ ba far@@ ms . it &apos;s about creating car@@ ts .
the fact is , it &apos;s con@@ tex@@ ted , and technology is a depen@@ ding power .
let me give you an example .
this is the story of na@@ po@@ le@@ on i@@ ii , in the middle of the 18@@ th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king from s@@ am to dinner for dinner .
na@@ po@@ le@@ on soldiers got sil@@ verti@@ -@@ be@@ hin@@ ey , na@@ po@@ le@@ on himself became gol@@ d bri@@ d@@ th@@ ure .
but the king of si@@ t , however , became al@@ umin@@ um bri@@ d@@ th@@ um .
al@@ umin@@ um at that time was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable as gold and radi@@ el@@ ar .
this is why the dom@@ es of the washington mon@@ um@@ ents of al@@ umin@@ um was made from al@@ umin@@ um .
even though al@@ umin@@ um is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the water mass , it doesn &apos;t seem as a p@@ lot of a metal .
it &apos;s lin@@ ked by oxygen and extremely si@@ tic .
but then the technology of electro@@ ly@@ tra@@ ction was developed , and it made al@@ umin@@ um production so that we use it with our re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ated ment@@ ality .
and then let &apos;s proje@@ ct this analog@@ y into the future .
we think of energy today of energy .
ladies and gentle@@ men , we live on a planet with 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ times more energy than we use a year of year .
16 ter@@ a@@ wat@@ a &apos;s energy pr@@ au@@ zes every ei@@ ght-@@ eight minutes on the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not about sc@@ ar@@ city , the problem is acc@@ essi@@ ble .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , you &apos;ve managed to reduce the cost of solar flow in india to 50 percent of the same power stream -- 8@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es compared to 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
the cost of solar energy shif@@ ted by 50 percent in the last year .
last month , that &apos;s published with a study that shows that , until at the end of this decade , in the sun@@ ny areas in the sun , we &apos;ll have six cents per k@@ w@@ h , compared to 15 cents per k@@ w@@ h , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we &apos;ve over@@ wh@@ el@@ med energy , we &apos;ll also have water in over@@ stream .
let &apos;s talk about water@@ -@@ war .
do you remember when car@@ l sa@@ gan was the vo@@ y@@ a@@ ter spac@@ ec@@ raft in 199@@ 0 , when it was moved on saturn , went back to earth &apos;s way back to earth ?
he took up a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a p@@ ex@@ al blue do@@ t . &quot;
it &apos;s because we &apos;re living on a water planet .
we live on a planet , which is 70 percent associated with water .
yes , it &apos;s 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent of s@@ alt water , two percent of them , and we &apos;re working by 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope also .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nan@@ ot@@ echn@@ ologi@@ ologi@@ cally on the way , nan@@ o-@@ materials .
and from a conversation this morning with de@@ an ka@@ man , one of the work of inno@@ v@@ ators , i &apos;d like to share with you something -- he gave me the per@@ mission -- his tech , which is the sl@@ ing@@ shot , which is the sl@@ ing@@ shot , and that many of you may have heard about it , and it &apos;s got the size of a fri@@ je@@ c@@ tory of a high school boat in a high school home
it can generate thousands of gall@@ ons of clean drin@@ king water per day -- whether sal@@ t@@ water , pollu@@ ted water , la@@ sting water , chi@@ r@@ ine -- and all that for less than two cents per gall@@ on .
the head of co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a has just shown a big test project , a big test project with a hundred un@@ its in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confi@@ dent , and then co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a will apply this technology glob@@ ally in 20@@ 6 countries all over the planet .
this is technology suppor@@ ted innovation that is now available today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this with mobile phones as well .
i mean , we &apos;ll soon get the 70 percent extin@@ ction rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 20@@ 13 to the end of 20@@ 13 .
just remember that a mas@@ sa@@ i war@@ ri@@ or with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya in kenya has a better mobile care than president re@@ ag@@ an , 25 years ago .
and if you go to google with your smar@@ t@@ phone , you &apos;d have more access to knowing more access and information clin@@ ton , 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in a world that has information and communic@@ ations in trans@@ depen@@ dence , as no one has ever predi@@ cted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i spend several thousand dollars -- gps , red video and photograph , libr@@ aries and photograph , journ@@ als full of books and music , technology to medical diagno@@ stics -- are now di@@ stor@@ ted and che@@ aper in your mobile phone .
and the best thing is , it &apos;s perhaps what interests us in health care .
in the last month , i had the pleasure to announ@@ ce what &apos;s called &quot; $ 10 million f@@ all tri@@ cor@@ der &apos;s &quot; $ 10 million f@@ all tri@@
and we &apos;re teaching teams around the world , trying to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone , so that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s co@@ is@@ et@@ ed with ai , you can actually s@@ hr@@ ink or your blood sc@@ or@@ es .
and to gain , the device needs to make a better diagno@@ sis than a team of highly trained physi@@ cians .
imagine this device . in fact , in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of disease and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care staf@@ f .
if this device sequen@@ ced a r@@ ink or dna virus , which is not known , it calls the health exchange , and prevent a pan@@ de@@ mic in front of their out@@ break .
but now , the biggest force that is going to lead us to a world of over@@ lin@@ able .
i call it &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for the population .
we &apos;ve just cros@@ sed the 7@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ a-@@ year brand .
and just by the way , the largest in@@ sur@@ ance against a population explosion is a better education and nutri@@ tion in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected up with two billion people online .
by 20@@ 20 , we &apos;re going to go from two to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds , which we &apos;ve never heard about before , will be the global communic@@ ations of the global communication
so what do these people need ?
what are they going to consu@@ me ? what are you going to be wor@@ thy ?
and instead of the economics of economics , i &apos;m seeing one of the greatest economic gy@@ ver@@ age of history .
these guys represent several trillion dollars that are going to the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become heal@@ thi@@ er by using the tri@@ co@@ der , and they &apos;re going to be trained better by the k@@ han acade@@ my , and by using the ability to use 3d prin@@ t@@ ers and gay analysis , and so much more productive than ever before .
so , what can be three billion growing , healthy , educ@@ ated , productive members of the human community ?
how about a sentence of new , never before hearing voices .
how about the op@@ pres@@ sion , wher@@ ever you are to give a voice to do a voice , to make change and change change , for the very first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring with ?
how about the subje@@ cts that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that small teams that are motiv@@ ated by passion and focused to extraordinary things , things that are able to create great companies and governments can only make the past in the
i &apos;d like to conclu@@ de with a story that &apos;s really puzz@@ led to me .
there &apos;s a program that might have already known some .
it &apos;s a game called the tor@@ ture .
it was developed in se@@ attle at the university of washington in se@@ attle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds to explore how the protein is going to be going .
it depen@@ ds on its behavior , and we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far , this has been a problem for super@@ computers .
and this game was done by university profess@@ ors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people now playing the game online .
and what it showed now is that , today , human pattern recogni@@ tion is better the proteins wrong than the best super@@ computers .
and when these guys came and looked at who was the best protein grain in the world , this was not a single professor , not a cal@@ tech student , it was someone from england , man@@ che@@ ster , a woman who worked during the day as a assi@@ dent clin@@ ic in the night , and at night the best proteins of the world was working at night , and at night the best proteins of protein was .
ladies and gentle@@ men , what makes me become enor@@ m@@ ously confidence in our future , is the fact that we now have more power than individuals to put us the great challenges of our planet .
we &apos;ve got access to tools with exponenti@@ al technology .
we have the passion of a di@@ y inno@@ v@@ ator .
we have the capital of the tech@@ no@@ -@@ phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ es .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online , to map the new challenges , and to do that , which is needed .
we expect a couple of remarkable decades .
thank you very much .
i think that we need to do something about a transforma@@ tive piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a doctor and that &apos;s what i am .
and maybe i &apos;m in business for a long time , that i can allow it to give me a piece of my own fal@@ se pre@@ t@@ ession to allow this possible .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not do it ?
we &apos;re close to the seas@@ onal seas@@ on , and we &apos;re moving on the world cham@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
baseball is full of magni@@ fi@@ cent statistics .
and there are a number of them .
&quot; mon@@ e@@ y@@ ball &quot; appe@@ ars , and it &apos;s about statistics , and in order to give them a great round of video team .
so , i &apos;m going to take on a stati@@ stic that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the average requi@@ re@@ ment of the bat .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat hits 300 .
what that means is that the player is paying three out of 10 stro@@ kes .
that &apos;s what makes the ball , and it &apos;s coming up , it &apos;s coming up , it &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the very first base , hasn &apos;t done it in time , and the run@@ ner was safe .
three out out of 10 .
you know how to call a 3@@ ,@@ 00@@ 00@@ th in ancient lea@@ gue baseball ?
all right , really good , maybe an all@@ -@@ star .
do you know how to call a 4@@ 00@@ th ?
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s in the bottom of 10 people in the bottom of 10
le@@ gen@@ iel -- as ted willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ s@@ r -- the last major lea@@ gue baseball player that hit over 400 times during a regular seas@@ on .
so let &apos;s trans@@ fer back to my world of medicine , where i feel about a lot of good , or maybe a little less than i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
imagine you have a blind education , and you &apos;ll be trans@@ mit@@ ted to an oper@@ at@@ eu@@ r whose average worth of 400 in terms of your blin@@ d@@ ness .
somehow that doesn &apos;t work , isn &apos;t it ?
as@@ sum@@ ing it lives in a certain remote area , and they have a loved man with ri@@ pped heart fe@@ eding , and their home@@ maker trans@@ mit@@ ted this to a car@@ di@@ ologist whose average performance at a matter of 200 .
but , but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better for this year . it &apos;s on a ris@@ ing bran@@ ch .
and they lay up a 25@@ 7 .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the average power for a car@@ di@@ ologist or a nur@@ se or an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c , a nin@@ e-@@ board , should be a res@@ cu@@ e for a res@@ cu@@ e ?
one hundred , very good .
the truth is that no one in all medicine knows what a good surge@@ on should be or a doctor or a res@@ cu@@ e or a res@@ cu@@ e .
what we do , however , is that we inclu@@ de each of them , including me , in the world , to be perfect with the appropriate .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s doing the details of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i took in medical school .
i was an obs@@ essi@@ vely obs@@ essi@@ onal student .
in the high school , a fellow student said that brian gold@@ man would learn for a flo@@ wer .
and that &apos;s what it was .
and i learned in my little track in the si@@ sters , in the si@@ sters of general , on the tor@@ ra general hospital , far from here .
i learned everything about it .
in my an@@ atom@@ ial lec@@ ture , i learned the orig@@ ins and distance every mus@@ cles , each bran@@ ch of each ar@@ tery , which resul@@ ts from the a@@ or@@ ta , and the ordinary differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ stics , which goes away from a@@ or@@ ta and ordinary
i even knew to classi@@ fy the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ do@@ sis .
and i gather@@ ed more and more knowledge and more knowledge .
and i was good , and i was looking at c@@ um lau@@ d@@ ause .
and i left the medical school with the impres@@ sion that i could , if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as close to complete , as close to complete , as possible as possible , that i was im@@ tru@@ n to do something about it .
and it worked for a while , until i met my wife &apos;s prin@@ ter .
i was resi@@ stant at a teaching hospital here in tor@@ onto as a woman prin@@ ter to me in the emergen@@ cy department of the hospital .
at that time , i was de@@ dic@@ ated the car@@ di@@ ology layer in car@@ di@@ ological services .
and it was my introdu@@ ction when the secret teacher was prepar@@ ing car@@ di@@ ological ad@@ vice to study the emergen@@ cy patients .
and to give feedback to my prime physi@@ cian .
i studied a woman prin@@ ter , and she was sc@@ ar@@ ri@@ ous .
and as i listen@@ ed to her , they made hun@@ ting sounds .
and when i heard her ch@@ est with ste@@ tho@@ scop@@ e , i was able to hear a cra@@ ck@@ piece sound on both sides , and that told me that she had suff@@ ered in the conven@@ i@@ ence of heart failure .
this is a condition where the heart is fail@@ ing , instead of pump@@ ing all the blood down , and there &apos;s a part of the blood in the lung , and they fill it up , and so the shor@@ t@@ le@@ ment came up .
and it wasn &apos;t a hard way to get diagno@@ se .
and i put them , and i made care of the treatment .
i gave her as@@ pir@@ in , and i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave your medicine that we call di@@ u@@ ti@@ tics , water p@@ ills , so that they &apos;re going to be the liquid .
and over a half and a half to two hours , they started feeling better to feel better .
and i felt really good .
and that &apos;s where i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
in fact , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without speaking with my national doctor .
i didn &apos;t take up the listen@@ er and did what i should have had , which was a call with my ch@@ est to tell it with him , so that he had a chance to do a chance to make a new picture .
and he knew her , he would be able to do addi@@ tional information to her .
maybe i did it with a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s need to be the doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility , that i was doing it , and so i would be able to worry about my patients without making it inter@@ acting with it .
my second er@@ ror was worse .
and i sent them home , i hi@@ red a quie@@ t voice in me , who was trying to tell me , &quot; mark man , no good idea . don &apos;t worry . &quot;
in fact , i was so thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by confidence that i asked the nur@@ se , which was the nur@@ se of the wife , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when she &apos;s going home ? &quot;
and the nur@@ se was thinking about it , and he said in a meaning@@ way , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot;
and i remember it as if it was yesterday .
so i sub@@ sig@@ ned the don@@ atory equipment and a nur@@ se and res@@ cu@@ e and res@@ cu@@ e , and i brought them home .
and i went back to the work .
the rest of the day , the ev@@ ening , i had this close feeling in my sto@@ mach .
but i continu@@ ed to work .
and at the end of the day , i grab@@ bed my stuff , and i went to the par@@ king lot to go home with my car , when i did something that i wouldn &apos;t possibly do .
and i went home from the emergen@@ cy department of my way home .
and there was another nur@@ se , not the sister , who had seen his wife prin@@ ter , but another three words to me , and those three words are afraid of the most emergen@@ cy of doctors i know .
other medical profession@@ als are afraid of these things , but the emergen@@ cy medicine is particularly especially because we &apos;re just seeing patients as well as the patients .
the three words said , remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients that they gave home ? &quot;
so the nur@@ se asked the nur@@ se .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in that particular note .
so , she was back .
she was back , and she was dying .
about an hour after she came home after i finished her home , she collap@@ sed , and the family called 9@@ 11 , and the family called 9@@ 11 , and the impro@@ v@@ ant off@@ ered them to the emergen@@ cy station with a meter of 50 , which is a dangerous sho@@ ck@@ ness of a place .
they were har@@ dly brea@@ thing , and it was a blue thing .
the emergen@@ cy nur@@ ses pulled all the str@@ ands .
they gave it their blood prin@@ ting .
they picked them on the bu@@ mp machine .
i was sho@@ cked , and i was sho@@ cked to the inner .
and i went through this roll@@ er track because she came to the inten@@ sive care station , and i hop@@ ed that she was going to re@@ cover .
and after two , three days , appar@@ ently , they realized they would never es@@ ele@@ te again .
it had not suff@@ ered a treat@@ able brain damage .
her family was gather@@ ed .
and in the course of eight or nine days , they started to get a lot of them .
on the day , she li@@ ps them -- woman prin@@ ter , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
it &apos;s said that you never forget the names of the people who don &apos;t die .
and that &apos;s the first time i learned this myself .
the next few weeks i made my sugge@@ sti@@ on , and i learned for the first time myself , the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isol@@ ated , not the kind of healthy sh@@ ame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy sh@@ ame , if you give you a secret of the best friend , even though that one is wrong and you &apos;re getting caught up , and you &apos;re going to get the best friend and you &apos;re going to give you a terrible argument , if you &apos;re at the end , but you &apos;re embar@@ ras@@ sed that you can never do that mistake again .
if you &apos;re doing re@@ fu@@ ven@@ ation , and you never make the mistake again .
this is the kind of edu@@ cational sh@@ ame .
the un@@ healthy way i &apos;m talking about is the ones that makes you sick in the inner@@ est .
it &apos;s the one who tells you not what you &apos;ve done is not what you &apos;ve done , but you &apos;re bad .
and that &apos;s the thing that i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my ch@@ ie@@ f , he was very , very de@@ ad@@ ly .
he was talking about the family , and i &apos;m sure he was drin@@ king the wo@@ und and i worried that i was not going to be su@@ red .
but i was continu@@ ing to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the board ? why did i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make such a stupid er@@ ror ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly , it was sa@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed .
and i started feeling better to feel .
and then on a ro@@ w@@ co day , there was a hole in the clou@@ ds , and the sun broke up , and i might say maybe i could feel better again .
and i agre@@ ed that if i dou@@ bled my eff@@ or@@ ts to perfe@@ ction and never again , i could never get a mistake that the voice could be de@@ vot@@ ed .
and she did it .
and i continu@@ ed to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had a service in the emergen@@ cy station in a commun@@ al hospital of the tor@@ onto , and i was proje@@ cting a 25 year-old man with pain@@ t@@ ly cra@@ ck@@ -@@ b@@ ye .
it was a lot of hur@@ ts , and i &apos;m in a hur@@ t .
he &apos;s always poin@@ ting here .
i looked down in the ra@@ il , and it was a little bit of p@@ ink .
and i gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin , and i sent him on .
and even as he walked out of the door , he showed up on his bu@@ t@@ ens .
two days later , i came to my ne@@ ar@@ est emergen@@ cy service , and my che@@ verti@@ r@@ ar asked me to a conversation to their office .
and she said the three words : remember , remember ?
&quot; remember , did you c@@ ry with the patient with the pres@@ cri@@ ption ? &quot;
it turns out that he &apos;s a ble@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ ene infe@@ ction .
he had a potential nutri@@ tional disease called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
you can hear that google , but it &apos;s not infe@@ ction of the ra@@ pe , but the top brea@@ ks , and it causes the tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory of the brea@@ ks .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got in@@ tra@@ c@@ ous anti@@ bo@@ tic@@ ine anti@@ bo@@ tic@@ a , and he got a few days later .
and i went back through the same ves@@ sel of sh@@ ing@@ ness and self-@@ dou@@ bt , and i &apos;d been re@@ lie@@ ved and went to the work until it was happening again and again and again and again .
in an emergen@@ cy rate , i &apos;ve cros@@ sed a blin@@ d@@ ward blin@@ d@@ ward two times .
there &apos;s a lot of this , especially when you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that only had 14 patients a night at that time .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there &apos;s probably no lack of interven@@ tion either in their treatment .
in one , i thought he would have kid@@ ney ro@@ cks .
i created the kid@@ ra@@ ys of the kid@@ ne@@ ys , when that was without a circum@@ stances , my collea@@ gue , at the re@@ ception of the patient &apos;s re@@ ception of the lower right sector , and i ph@@ oned the oper@@ ators .
the other one was strong di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
i created flu@@ i@@ des to re@@ hy@@ ti@@ late him , and i asked my colleagues to understand him as well as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and he determin@@ ed a con@@ stra@@ int in the right sec@@ tors , he called the oper@@ ators .
in both cases , surgery was oper@@ ated , and it was good .
both of those cases , they were worried about me , worried .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only meant in the first five years , which is what many of my colleagues cla@@ im , but there &apos;s a total non@@ sense .
some of my pieces of my sil@@ ent act in the last five years .
alone , sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close up with my mistakes and talk about them , if i ask the quie@@ t voice that tells me , what really can &apos;t find , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i convince you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i &apos;m in a room -- like now , i &apos;ve got no idea what you think you &apos;re thinking about .
when &apos;s the last time you heard of someone &apos;s sc@@ or@@ es of er@@ ror , what &apos;s the last time you heard about the mis@@ er@@ a ?
oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party , and you like you to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and to ask their immedi@@ ate support and tell them what i just told you about , i would not get the end of the second story before it would not be the end of the second story before it was really un@@ comfortable , and they would change the top@@ ic and forget to the rest of it .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , or my colleagues , that an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c in my hospital had taken me the wrong leg , then they believe i had trouble to look into the eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely den@@ ial of failure .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic posi@@ tions -- the ones that make er@@ ror and those who don &apos;t do , the ones who don &apos;t do , the ones who don &apos;t fit sle@@ a@@ fs and those with good out@@ comes and with good out@@ comes .
it &apos;s almost an ide@@ ological response like anti@@ bodies that attack a human race .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we thre@@ aten those who make mistakes out of medicine , that we get a safe system .
but there are two problems with this .
in my number of years of medical sen@@ su@@ ation and journ@@ alism , i &apos;ve developed a personal medical study about medical fail@@ ures and fal@@ se treat@@ ments to do whatever possible for one of my first article that i show for the tor@@ onto star to my show , &quot; white co@@ at , black art . &quot;
and what i learned is that er@@ ror is absolutely ir@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day we can er@@ a@@ dic@@ ate er@@ ror , where one of 10 medi@@ cations is either a wrong or fa@@ ke or fal@@ sed , in which american infe@@ ctions are increasingly and more and more de@@ va@@ station or dead .
in this state , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 24@@ ,000 can@@ adi@@ ans are dying of dis@@ par@@ ity .
in the united states , the study for medicine is the number of 100,000 years .
and both of these are strong sub@@ stit@@ ations , because we don &apos;t really look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the cru@@ x .
in a hospital system in which medical knowledge dou@@ bled each two or three years , we can &apos;t get rid of it .
sleep de@@ gra@@ dation is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive er@@ ror , so that we can take a perfect disease on a patient with a patient with breast pain .
and then i take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , and i &apos;m going to s@@ hr@@ ink it and i &apos;m going to s@@ hr@@ ink it and give it a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic breath , and all of a sudden , the story is re@@ lie@@ ving with con@@ temp@@ t .
i &apos;m not going to take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things the same thing .
and my patients are not cars ; they tell me their symptom@@ s don &apos;t always tell me in the same way .
all of this is un@@ avo@@ i@@ si@@ ble by all of those things .
so if you take the system the way i &apos;ve been trained to do it , and all the fail@@ ing health exper@@ ts , then there &apos;s no more left left .
and do you know the more motiv@@ ators about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white co@@ at , &quot; black art . &quot; i said , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would go to each of the res@@ cu@@ e to the che@@ mis@@ s of the car@@ di@@ ologist to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h . &quot; and then i &apos;m going to show the micro@@ phone to him .
and then your pu@@ p@@ pl@@ es exp@@ and , they come in front of your head , and look down , and they start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same er@@ ror that i have in soli@@ d . &quot;
what they need is a environment that causes them to do it .
what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physi@@ cian .
the rein@@ v@@ ented physi@@ cian is a human , white about his humanity , accep@@ ting them , is not very proud to make mistakes , but to learn everything about them so that it can be passed on .
it &apos;s sharing their experiences with others .
they &apos;re suppor@@ ting when other people are talking about their mistakes .
and it shows others from others , not see@@ ked , but in a lo@@ vely , suppor@@ tive way , that all of them benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that reali@@ zes that people fill the system with life , and if that &apos;s so , people do the er@@ ror of time to time .
so that the system develop@@ s to create the back@@ wir@@ ing , which makes it easier to find mistakes that people inevi@@ t@@ ably make , and it also en@@ ab@@ ling it to create the suppor@@ tive spaces , where anyone who monit@@ or@@ es health , can actually respond to things that can actually talk about what potential er@@ ror is and even re@@ war@@ ded for people like me , and that should be re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ating for people like me , and that should be re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ating for people like me , and that &apos;s what should be re@@ war@@ ding for people like me , and that &apos;s what should be re@@ war@@ ding for people like me , and it should be re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ating for the re@@ gra@@ gation of that .
so my name is brian gold@@ man .
i &apos;m the new definition of the doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i re@@ gre@@ t . but i &apos;m trying to learn the best way to talk about it in order to pass it .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with that .
let me conclu@@ de with three of my words : i remember it .
i &apos;m going to talk about a very tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about transforma@@ tional quanti@@ ties .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you about three stories to use the time .
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my hero@@ es .
you may know that he was here in 18@@ 35 .
you might think that he hat@@ s fin@@ es , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he gather@@ ed fish .
he described one of them as very , very common .
it was a pu@@ pp@@ y che@@ ek .
up to the &apos; 8@@ 0s , he was fis@@ hed in great style .
now , he &apos;s on the red list of en@@ danger@@ ed species .
this story , we &apos;ve heard a lot of times from the gala@@ pa@@ gos is@@ lands or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet , we &apos;re still on the gala@@ pa@@ gos .
we &apos;re still thinking , they &apos;re origin@@ ally .
the che@@ cker@@ h@@ s are still described them as un@@ tou@@ ched .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
the second story is to be a different concept , the change of the change , the change .
because i first studied it when i studied a la@@ go@@ on in west africa , in 197@@ 1 .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work later in africa later .
i thought i could be integr@@ ated .
and i got a bad sun@@ bur@@ ker , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really have it from there .
it was my first sun@@ bur@@ ker .
and as you can see , the la@@ go@@ on of pal@@ ms and some man@@ gro@@ ves were covered by a couple of man@@ gro@@ ves .
there was about 20 in@@ ches of about 20 in@@ ches , black c@@ attle , sort of a de@@ fe@@ ct of the bun@@ d@@ board .
the fis@@ ks of this bun@@ let were very productive , and the fis@@ her@@ men lived well of it , and they were ear@@ ning in ghana at average .
when i went back to 27 years later , the fish was s@@ hr@@ as@@ sin@@ ated to half its size .
it &apos;s grown by a five-@@ centi@@ meter .
and they were gene@@ tically dama@@ ged .
it was still fish .
the people were still happy .
and the fish also had the lu@@ ck to be there .
so , it has changed nothing , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my co-@@ associ@@ ation in the introdu@@ ction of the destruction of south asia in sou@@ the@@ ast asia .
in the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- more recently at the beginning of the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- europe has increas@@ ed a lot of development programs .
fis@@ lation has developed countries that are already starting to have 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing of this rather ug@@ ly ship is mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
and i was looking at it , and we were doing phenomen@@ ori@@ ties throughout the southern south chinese sea , and particularly in the h@@ vas@@ e@@ e .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know now , that &apos;s the reason of the sea .
nin@@ et@@ y-@@ five percent of our fan@@ t@@ ings were spon@@ ging , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there , on the s@@ lau@@ ghter , the ru@@ b@@ ble pi@@ pe , were coral re@@ ef@@ s .
and basically , the reason of the sea was on de@@ ck , and was then thro@@ wn back .
these pain@@ t@@ ings are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you take a match , and then you start with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changed . it &apos;s like -- in this case -- a hard reason or white cor@@ als becomes a gri@@ ck@@ y cra@@ ck .
this is a dead tur@@ d@@ board .
they weren &apos;t eating , you thre@@ w them away , because they were dead .
once again , we started a complete way .
it wasn &apos;t dr@@ un@@ k yet .
and then they wanted them to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of dr@@ ars are being re@@ treated by fis@@ her@@ ers every time they &apos;re driving in areas that have never been fis@@ hed .
it &apos;s not docum@@ ented , but it &apos;s not docum@@ ented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember about it .
we ada@@ pt our in@@ tent to the new level , and don &apos;t let us remember what there was there .
if you gener@@ alize it , this is what happens .
on the y-@@ axis , some good things : bio@@ diversity , number of or@@ ca , the size of or@@ ca , the city of water , the water reser@@ ve .
over time , it changes . it changes , because of humans , their actions are in the same way .
every generation looks at the images that they take at the beginning of their most conscious life , as op@@ posed to all of it .
the difference is then being seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t really take the previous los@@ ses to it .
and there can be a sequence of change .
and at the end of the end , they just want to get the great rema@@ ins of the rema@@ ins .
and that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re most up@@ set now .
we want to get things that are disappe@@ ared , or things that are not the way they were .
now , you might think that the problem of people who are certainly living when they lived in roman@@ tic@@ al societies , animals killed , and they were aware that only after a few generations , they were aware of .
because obviously , an animal that has lived very often , it &apos;s almost rare before it dies out .
so , you don &apos;t lose very frequ@@ ently , frequ@@ ently .
you &apos;re still losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not percei@@ ved as a big loss of loss .
over time , we &apos;re going to focus on the big animals , and in the oceans , they &apos;re the big fish .
they get smaller because we &apos;re cat@@ ching them .
over time , there &apos;s just fish left left , and we think that &apos;s the value of failure .
the question is , why people accept this .
well , because you don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , a lot of people , scientists , con@@ fir@@ ms that it was really different .
you &apos;re going to con@@ fir@@ m it , because the evidence , as you don &apos;t , in an earlier form of form , are not the way you &apos;d like to explain the evidence .
now , for example , there &apos;s an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ al report that the proje@@ ctor report so that there &apos;s large fis@@ her@@ ies , which can &apos;t be used in this region , can &apos;t be used , or by fis@@ sure scientists normally , because it &apos;s not a scientific thing .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we &apos;re living in acade@@ mic societies , because they don &apos;t trust the past sources of the past .
this shows the enor@@ m@@ ously large role that a marine reser@@ ve can play .
because through marine prote@@ ction , we basically ins@@ ert the past again .
and we &apos;re starting to do the past that people can &apos;t understand , because the quanti@@ ty has changed and very low .
so , the people who see a marine reser@@ ve and benefit from the insi@@ ght that allows them to re@@ store their in@@ sur@@ gen@@ cies .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they don &apos;t have access to -- the people in the mid@@ west , for example ?
here , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap and the movie , and simu@@ lations .
so this is the simulation of ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke bay .
a long time ago , there were gl@@ als -- 500 years ago , 500 years ago .
and the paint sounds and squ@@ ee@@ zes you might remember &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar . &quot;
when you think of &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar , &quot; if you think about why people have been tou@@ ched this way -- apart from the po@@ ca@@ ma story , why were they so tou@@ ched from the image of the visual world ?
because it &apos;s called a little wa@@ ke that has lost it in a certain way .
so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , the only one i &apos;m going to give you is c@@ amer@@ on , so he &apos;s turning up &quot; a@@ vat@@ ar ii , &quot; under@@ water .
thank you very much .
in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , in commun@@ ist east germany , you had to have to protect a ty@@ pe@@ writer , regi@@ ster@@ ing them at government .
they also had to regi@@ ster a lea@@ f with an exc@@ ell@@ ent text from this scri@@ pt .
the reason for that : the government could re@@ tra@@ ct where a text came from .
they found an article with fal@@ se thought , and they were able to dete@@ ct the cre@@ ator of that thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , how anyone could do something like this , and how much that would be re@@ fin@@ ed to the freedom of the support .
in our own countries , we would never do this .
but if you buy a new foot@@ tom prin@@ ter today in 2011 , you buy a new color prin@@ ter from the top las@@ er prin@@ ting factory and print a page , bright yellow stro@@ kes on each page , in a pattern that makes the side clearly on you and your prin@@ ter .
this is what happens to us today .
and there seems to no one that nobody seems to be
and this was an example of how our own governments our own governments are the technology against us , the citizens , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of today &apos;s exi@@ sting future problems .
so let &apos;s see what &apos;s really going on in the world : we can divi@@ de the attac@@ ks in categ@@ ories .
we &apos;ve got three main groups .
there are the online crimin@@ als .
for example , here , this is mr. di@@ mit@@ ry gol@@ u@@ bo@@ w from k@@ ie@@ w in the u@@ kra@@ ine .
and the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
these guys deser@@ ve money .
they use thousands of attac@@ ks to ear@@ n a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online milli@@ on@@ ary , multi-@@ milli@@ on@@ ari@@ ans , who have ear@@ ned their money through attac@@ ks .
this is wh@@ lich@@ di@@ ck t@@ sa@@ st@@ or &apos;s t@@ sa@@ st@@ or in est@@ eland .
this is al@@ fre@@ d gon@@ z@@ ale@@ z .
ste@@ phen wat@@ ts .
b@@ j@@ bor@@ n s@@ und@@ in .
this is mat@@ the@@ w ander@@ son , t@@ ari@@ q al-@@ da@@ i , and so on and so on .
these guys have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve re@@ gar@@ ded it by doing the tro@@ j@@ ers to cla@@ ok money from our bank accoun@@ ts , while we &apos;re doing our online ban@@ king , or key@@ log@@ es that have colle@@ cted our credit card information , while we buy about an infe@@ cted computer online at the time we buy online .
the u.s. intelligence agen@@ cy two months ago , the s@@ wis@@ s account of mr. sam ja@@ in here , and on that meeting , was 14@@ .@@ 9 million u.s. dollars when it was fro@@ zen .
mr. ja@@ in itself is on a de@@ light of foot , the rise spot is un@@ known .
and i cla@@ im that it &apos;s more likely today that we will become vic@@ ti@@ ms of a medical crimin@@ al , as a con@@ cer@@ gation in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be even worse .
in the future , most of the cri@@ mes are going to play online .
the second largest flu group that we can wit@@ ness today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
they &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- prote@@ sts about , one opini@@ on , or by your audience .
groups like anony@@ mous have moved up over the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become one of the main players at the time of the medical attack .
so these are the three main services groups : crimin@@ als , who do the money for the cause of the cause , bu@@ ck@@ oni@@ sts like anony@@ mous , but the last group are nations , governments that cause attac@@ ks .
that &apos;s where acci@@ dents seem to be attac@@ king us like ta@@ in@@ ot@@ ar .
it shows an example of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
sha@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a complete cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate from the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- it was that .
in the last fall , it had to be put in in@@ sol@@ ories , because l@@ in@@ ot@@ ar had been ha@@ cked .
somebody had collap@@ sed , and he had ha@@ cked up the system .
and last week , in a meeting with du@@ tch governments , i asked one of the sen@@ ior members of this group asking me if he was able to tell it , that because of the cas@@ in@@ ot@@ i ha@@ wel@@ s had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
well , how do people die in the con@@ sequence of such a ha@@ ck@@ sha@@ cks ?
well , sha@@ in@@ ot@@ ar is a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation .
they &apos;re selling cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
so what do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
now , a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate is requi@@ red if you have a website with h@@ tt@@ ps , with cool@@ -@@ en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , for example , g@@ mail .
now , we all use , or many of us , g@@ mail , or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially invest@@ ed in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states such as iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign offi@@ ci@@ als such as g@@ mail use , because they know that they can trust more trust than local po@@ ll@@ s , and that they &apos;re en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted by s@@ ton@@ ous connections , so that the local government can &apos;t s@@ hr@@ ink into their conver@@ sa@@ tions .
but , you know , if you go into a foreign foreign situation .
cer@@ ti@@ fication and crimin@@ al cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate exchange out and fe@@ l@@ ted cer@@
and that &apos;s exactly what ta@@ in@@ ot@@ ar &apos;s in the case .
how does it apply to the arab@@ ic spring and the things that are happening in eg@@ y@@ pt ?
now in eg@@ y@@ pt , the dec@@ ent@@ ers at apri@@ l in apri@@ l was the head@@ quar@@ ters of eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an intelligence police , and in fact they found a lot of action .
and in these recor@@ ds , a fol@@ der was called &quot; fin@@ fis@@ man . &quot;
and in this fol@@ der , the no@@ ti@@ ries of one in germany were found in germany that had sold a few programs that they had sold a few programs that they had -- in very lar@@ ge-@@ scale , in the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an citizens , were able to capture .
they had sold this program for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 euro@@ s to the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an government .
the corpo@@ rate head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
so western governments reli@@ ance tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments , so that they can take advantage of their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , what happened in germany a few weeks ago , which was a tro@@ j@@ man who was used by ger@@ man government leaders to de@@ pic@@ t their own citizens .
if you &apos;re sus@@ pe@@ cted in a crimin@@ al case , it &apos;s going to boun@@ ce your tele@@ phone with your tele@@ phone .
but today , we are far beyond that .
they ta@@ p their internet connec@@ tivity .
they use tools like the state admini@@ strat@@ ors to interact with a tro@@ j@@ er , who allows them to monit@@ or their entire communic@@ ations , listen to their online discus@@ sions , to send their pas@@ s@@ words .
so , when we &apos;re thinking about these things , the obvious answer would be like , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not going to worry about it , because i &apos;m a bright citi@@ zen . &quot;
i don &apos;t have to worry about it !
i &apos;ve got nothing to hi@@ de . &quot;
and that argu@@ ment doesn &apos;t make sense .
so priv@@ acy needs to be given .
priv@@ acy is not about the debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between priv@@ acy and security .
it &apos;s a choice between liber@@ ty and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , in 2011 , our governments may be trust , but the right is every right that we &apos;re giving out forever forever forever .
and trust , we &apos;ll be blind to each future government , a government that we might have to have in fif@@ ty years ?
those are the questions that we have to engage with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of con@@ cre@@ te sk@@ et@@ ches .
the first con@@ cre@@ te st@@ ones were made in 18@@ 6@@ 8 , and they made a simple idea : co@@ vel@@ les from c@@ ement with inten@@ se meas@@ ures that fit together .
con@@ cre@@ te ro@@ cks became very quickly the most pre@@ ce@@ ded building unit in the world .
they were pus@@ hing us to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , a rock after another .
and essentially , the con@@ cre@@ te building was given to the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 194@@ 7 , le@@ go came out of this .
it was called &quot; auto@@ matically lin@@ king rock . &quot;
and within a few years , le@@ go , in every hou@@ se@@ hold , went in every hou@@
it &apos;s esti@@ ma@@ ted that over 400 billion ro@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 blocks for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges or beautiful building .
le@@ go made it possible for all possible .
and le@@ go basically has the con@@ cre@@ te building block , the building block of the world , and it took a building block for our imagination .
in the mean@@ time , the same year on the bell lab@@ s was announ@@ ced the next revolution , the ne@@ ar@@ est building block .
the transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would give us from a world of the sta@@ tic , high-@@ extin@@ ct building blocks to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
like the con@@ cre@@ te block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows us to build a lot larger , more complex circu@@ y@@ les , a rock after another .
but there &apos;s a key difference : the transi@@ st@@ or was just for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t believe that the building block of our time is reser@@ ved for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to put the power of engineers into the hands of artists and designers
a couple of years ago , i started to develop li@@ tt@@ li@@ ties .
so let me show you how they work .
so , li@@ tt@@ vi@@ ths are electr@@ onic mode that have a specific function .
they &apos;re appropriate , lights , sound , t@@ aller , engine and sen@@ sor .
and the best thing is that they connect with magne@@ ts together .
that &apos;s how you can &apos;t put them wrong , right ?
the st@@ ones are color@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
green is com@@ pres@@ sing , blue is electricity , p@@ ink is input , p@@ ink is a c@@ able .
so all you have to do is connect a blue and a green , and you can build a very quickly circu@@ it of scale .
you put a blue one on a green , and you can make light .
you can ins@@ ert a switch between it , and so you have a little lo@@ ck@@ man .
take the switch out of a pul@@ smo@@ int , this is here , put up , and you made a little hand guy .
add this bu@@ zz@@ er for a more addi@@ ctive effect , and they made a l@@ ure machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , li@@ tt@@ vi@@ ths are actually quite powerful .
instead of progra@@ t@@ ching , you have to recy@@ cle or re@@ wired or re@@ wired , li@@ st@@ ill@@ ess allows them to program with simple , intui@@ tive gest@@ ures .
so in order to speed the blin@@ k , or slow down , turn on that butt@@ on , and it makes the moment@@ um faster or slo@@ wer .
the idea behind li@@ tt@@ vi@@ ties is that it &apos;s a growing library of the library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a pre-@@ profit stone .
lights , sound , solar op@@ tions , mot@@ ors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve cros@@ sed li@@ tt@@ vi@@ ties to kids , and we see them play with it .
and it was an un@@ belie@@ vable experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electr@@ on@@ ics that surro@@ unds them in the everyday day and learn them not in school .
like , for example , just like a d@@ light , or why the do@@ ors seem to touch , or why an ipo@@ d respon@@ ds on touch , or how an ipo@@ d respon@@ ds on touch .
we &apos;ve also brought li@@ tt@@ leb@@ li@@ ties to design schools .
so , for example , we didn &apos;t have designer with no experience in electr@@ onic things that started playing with li@@ tt@@ vi@@ d@@ anders as a material .
here we see , with fil@@ us , paper and water bot@@ tles , like korea that ...
a few weeks ago , we brought licen@@ se li@@ tt@@ vi@@ li@@ ates and gave them some designers that had no technical experience what@@ so@@ ever -- just kar@@ ton , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do whatever . &quot;
so here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a mov@@ ement@@ -@@ controlled con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on can@@ op@@ y .
but , wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hum@@ ly of k@@ ough , the fear of the dark .
for these inse@@ c@@ tors , li@@ tt@@ vi@@ ths became another material , electr@@ on@@ ics became a different material .
and we want to make this material available for all .
so , li@@ stable open source is li@@ stable .
you can go on the website , down@@ load all the design conditions and make them build themselves .
we want to encoura@@ ge the world , the inv@@ ent@@ or , the inv@@ ent@@ or , to encoura@@ ge , because this world , in which we live , these inter@@ active world , bel@@ on@@ gs to us .
so , pull ahead and start to inv@@ ent .
thank you very much .
